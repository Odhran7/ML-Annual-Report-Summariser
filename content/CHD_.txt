competition

we compete in the household and personal care consumer product categories which are highly innovative categories characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and require significant advertising and promotion we compete in these categories primarily on the basis of product innovation and performance brand recognition price value and other consumer benefits consumer products particularly laundry and dietary supplements are subject to significant price competition as a result we from time to time may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share product introductions typically involve heavy marketing and trade spending in the year of launch and we usually are not able to determine whether 

 

the new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product line 

because of the competitive retail environment we face pricing pressure from our retail customers and customers selling through other channels particularly highvolume retail customers including internetbased retailers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms that could reduce our margins furthermore if we are unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to our customers they could increase product purchases from competitors and reduce purchases from us which would harm our sales and profitability

our competitors in the consumer domestic and consumer international segments include among others procter  gamble company “pg” the clorox company colgatepalmolive company sc johnson  son inc nestle purina petcare company and nestle health science henkel reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson ansell limited pfizer inc bayer ag alere inc nbty inc koninklijke philips nv unilever plc sanofi and pharmavite llc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and have the capacity to outspend us in their attempts to gain market share in addition the growing number of sales channels and business models such as niche brands internetonly brands and retailer codeveloped and owned brands have increased competition in certain product categories particularly within personal care specialty hair care and dietary supplements from less well capitalized competitors 

competition within our animal and food production and our specialty chemicals product lines is intense the specialty chemicals business operates in a competitive environment influenced by capacity utilization customers ’ leverage and the impact of raw material and energy costs product introductions typically involve introductory educational costs in the year of launch and we usually are not able to determine whether new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of new products or the extension of the product lines our key competitors with respect to our spd segment are cargill incorporated lallemand inc solvay chemicals inc genesis alkali and natural soda inc for additional discussion of the competitive environment in which we conduct our business see item 1a risk factors

distribution of our products

our consumer domestic and consumer international segments products are marketed primarily through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets mass merchandisers wholesale clubs drugstores convenience stores home stores dollar and other discount stores pet and other specialty stores and websites and other ecommerce channels all of which sell our products to consumers the consumer domestic segment employs a sales force based regionally throughout the us and utilizes the services of independent brokers who represent our products in the food mass pet dollar club and numerous other classes of trade our consumer international segment conducts business through subsidiaries and global export markets our subsidiaries employ local sales and marketing teams that manage the retailer and trade relationships while export sales and marketing professionals also manage an extensive distributor network in our global export markets our products are stored in our plants and thirdparty owned warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking companies or picked up by customers at our facilities 

spd markets sodium bicarbonate and other chemicals to industrial and agricultural customers primarily throughout the us and canada distribution is accomplished through a dedicated sales force supplemented by manufacturers ’ representatives and independent distributors our products in this segment are stored in our plants and public warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking companies or picked up by customers at our facilities

seasonality

 

our business is generally not seasonal although the consumer domestic and consumer international segments are affected by sales of spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrushes and waterpik water flossers which typically are higher during the fall in advance of the holiday season sales of nair depilatories and waxes which typically are higher in the spring and summer months sales of vitafusion and l ’ il critters dietary supplements and zicam cold shortening and relief category products which typically are slightly higher in the fourth quarter of each year in advance of the cold and flu season and renewed commitments to health and sales of flawless which are typically higher in the second half of the year in spd several of our animal and food production products experience higher demand in warmer weather months creating higher seasonal demand in the second and third quarters of the year 

raw materials and sources of supply

we manufacture sodium bicarbonate for our consumer and specialty products businesses at our plants located at green river wyoming and old fort ohio the primary source of soda ash a basic raw material used in the production of sodium bicarbonate is the mineral trona which is found in abundance in southwestern wyoming near our green river plant we have adequate trona reserves under mineral leases to support our sodium bicarbonate requirements for the foreseeable future 

we are a party to a partnership agreement with tata chemicals soda ash partners which mines and processes trona reserves in wyoming we fulfill a substantial amount of our soda ash requirements through the partnership and related supply and services agreements enabling us to achieve some of the economies of an integrated business capable of producing sodium bicarbonate and related products from the basic raw 

 

material we also have an agreement for the supply of soda ash from another company the partnership agreement and other supply agreements between the tata chemicals soda ash partners and us are terminable upon two years notice by either of us we believe that sufficient alternative sources of soda ash supply are available 

we believe that ample sources of raw materials are available for all our other major products detergent chemicals are used in a variety of our products and are available from a number of sources bottles paper products and clay are available from multiple suppliers although we choose to source most of these materials from single sources under longterm supply agreements in order to gain favorable economies of scale we also use certifiable sustainable palm oil derivatives in a number of products including primarily in our rumen bypass fats products alternative sources of supply are available in case of the disruption or termination of the supply agreements

the cost of raw materials including surfactants diesel fuel and oilbased raw and packaging materials used primarily in our consumer businesses were higher in 2021 relative to 2020 increasing our core commodity costs increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact our costs and financial results if we are unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to our customers

we utilize the services of third party contract manufacturers around the world for certain products 

patents and trademarks

our trademarks appear in upper case letters throughout this annual report the majority of our trademarks are registered with either the us patent and trademark office or with the trademark offices of many foreign countries the arm  hammer trademark has been used by us since 1867 and is a valuable asset and important to the successful operation of our business our products are sold under many other valuable trademarks held by us including trojan nair orajel waterpik first response xtra oxiclean spinbrush batiste simply saline l ’ il critters vitafusion flawless zicam and therabreath our portfolio of trademarks represents substantial value in the businesses using the trademarks

us patents are currently granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed although we actively seek and maintain a number of patents no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole 

customers and order backlog 

in each of the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 net sales to our largest customer walmart inc and its affiliates  “ walmart ”  were 24 23 and 24 respectively of our consolidated net sales no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales in the threeyear period the time between receipt of orders and shipment is generally short and as a result backlog is not significant 

government regulation

general

some of our products are subject to regulation by one or more us agencies including the us food and drug administration  “ fda ”  the environmental protection agency  “ epa ”  the federal trade commission  “ ftc ”  the consumer product safety commission  “ cpsc ”  and foreign agencies 

fda regulations govern a variety of matters relating to our products such as product development manufacturing premarket clearance or approval labeling and distribution the regulations adopted and standards imposed by the fda and similar foreign agencies evolve over time and can require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes and quality systems to remain in compliance these agencies periodically inspect manufacturing and other facilities if we fail to comply with applicable regulations and standards we may be subject to sanctions including fines and penalties the recall of products and cessation of manufacturing andor distribution 

in addition we sell products that are subject to regulation under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and the toxic substances control act both of which are administered by the epa 

we are also subject to regulation by the ftc in connection with the content and truthfulness of our labeling advertising promotion trade practices and other matters the ftc has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of otherwise false or misleading advertising claims these enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties andor restitution by the companies involved such actions can result in substantial financial penalties and significantly restrict the marketing of our products

the cpsc has jurisdiction over consumer products regulates their safety and has authority over recalls the cpsc administers the poison prevention packaging act and has issued regulations requiring special child resistant packaging for certain products including pharmaceuticals dietary supplements and dietary substances containing certain ingredients eg iron

 

our relationship with certain union employees is regulated by various agencies of the countries states provinces and other localities in which we sell our products 

medical device clearance and approval 

to be commercially distributed in the us a medical device must unless exempt receive clearance or approval from the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act  “ fdca ”  for lower risk class ii devices we must generally submit a premarket notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution known as a “ 510k ” clearance our condoms lubricants contact lens solution wound wash home pregnancy test kits and waterpik professional dental products are regulated as class ii devices some other low risk devices including spinbrush and other battery powered toothbrushes and waterpik water flossers are in class i and are generally exempted from the 510k requirements to obtain 510k clearance a device must be determined to be substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a benchmark device or “ predicate ” that is already legally in commercial distribution any modification to a 510k cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a change in its intended use generally requires a new 510k clearance we may determine that a new 510k clearance is not required but if the fda disagrees it may retroactively require a 510k clearance and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified device until 510k clearance is obtained 

otc pharmaceutical

we market overthecounter “otc” pharmaceutical products such as toothpaste antiperspirant and oral analgesics products that are also subject to fda and foreign regulation under the us otc monograph system selected otc pharmaceutical products are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the submission and approval of a new drug application the fda otc monographs include wellknown ingredients and specify requirements for permitted indications required warnings and precautions allowable combinations of ingredients and dosage levels pharmaceutical products marketed under the otc monograph system must conform to specific quality formula and labeling requirements products not in the monograph system can be deemed to be unapproved new drugs and can be forced from the market this is particularly the case for homeopathic drug products like certain zicam products both the fda and the ftc have taken the position that homeopathic products are unapproved new drugs regulatory action against these products is deemed unlikely unless the products present an unreasonable safety risk zicam homeopathic products are not currently perceived to pose any such risk

all facilities where otc pharmaceutical products are manufactured tested packaged stored or distributed must comply with cgmp regulations andor regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries where the facilities are located all of our pharmaceutical products are manufactured tested packaged stored and distributed according to cgmp regulations the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that our facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representations made to customers or to regulatory action against us related to the products made in that facility such as seizure injunction or recall serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against us that among other things could result in the suspension of production or distribution of our products product seizures loss of certain licenses or other governmental penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results we are required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of our otc pharmaceutical products marketed in the us 

we cannot predict whether new legislation regulating our activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on our business

medical device and otc pharmaceutical postmarket regulation

after a medical device andor otc pharmaceutical is commercialized numerous regulatory requirements apply including 



 

 

 

food products

we market baking soda and animal feed products such as rumen fermentation enhancers and dietary cationanion difference  “ dcad ”  balancers that are also subject to fda and foreign regulation the food safety modernization act  “ fsma ”  regulates food and animal feed products and mandates preventive controls including hazard analysis risk controls supplier qualifications and controls and increased record keeping fsma grants the fda the authority to require mandatory recalls for products under certain conditions the fda is currently in the process of establishing rules and guidance to implement the provisions of fsma the potential impact of these rules and applicable guidance cannot be determined now

dietary supplements

the processing formulation safety manufacturing packaging labeling advertising distribution importing selling and storing our gummy vitamin dietary supplements are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies including the fda the ftc the cpsc the epa and by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold the fdca governs the composition safety labeling manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements 

it is unlawful to market as a dietary supplement any article that is approved as a new drug or is authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and made public unless that article was first marketed as a dietary supplement or food the fda has authority to effectively void that restriction through the issuance of a regulation finding the article lawful to date the fda has not exercised that rulemaking authority for any article

dietary ingredients that were not marketed in the us before october 15 1994 must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the fda at least 75 days before the initial marketing unless the ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for food without being chemically altered the notification must provide evidence of a history of use or other evidence establishing that use of the dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe the fda may determine that notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a new ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe which could effectively prevent the marketing of the ingredient in august of 2016 the fda issued draft guidance governing notification of new dietary ingredients although the draft guidance was issued for public comment and not for implementation it is a strong indication of the fda’s current thinking on the topics discussed in the guidance including the fda’s approach to enforcement if the fda enforces the applicable statutes and regulations in accord with the draft guidance that could effectively change the status of dietary ingredients that the industry has marketed as “ old ” dietary ingredients to “ new ” dietary ingredients and may require submission of a new dietary ingredient notification 

a company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess information substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading if the fda determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim or if the fda determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific evidence or is otherwise false or misleading the claim could not be used and any product bearing the claim could be subject to regulatory action

the fda ’ s cgmp regulations govern the manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers as with otc products the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that our dietary supplement facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representation made to consumers or to regulatory action against us related to the products made in that facility seizure injunction or recall there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the fda ’ s interpretation and implementation of the cgmp regulations the failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cgmp regulations may render products manufactured in that facility adulterated and subjects those products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential fda enforcement actions the manufacturer packer or distributor of a dietary supplement marketed in the us whose name appears on the label of the supplement is required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of that supplement to the fda 

additional legislation may be introduced which if passed would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements the effect of additional domestic or international governmental legislation regulations or administrative orders if and when promulgated cannot be determined new legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards and require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risks and uncertainties as well as other factors described elsewhere in this annual report or in our other filings with the commission could individually and collectively have a material adverse impact on our business reputation financial results financial condition andor the trading price of our common stock 

business and operational risks



we face intense competition from consumer products companies both in the us and in international markets most of our products compete with other widelyadvertised promoted and merchandised brands within each product category and from retailers including supermarkets mass merchandisers wholesale clubs drugstores convenience stores home stores dollar and other discount stores pet and other specialty stores and websites and other ecommerce channels which are increasingly offering private label and retailerbranded brands and generic nonbranded products in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices  in china in particular we face strong competition from local manufacturers offering both generic and branded products the use of evolving technology to develop more complex pricing models by retailers has led and may continue to lead to pricing pressures in some categories in addition during times of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more “private label” or other lower price brands these developments have increased competition in certain product categories in particular including dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics in addition to competition across all our product categories there continues to be significant product competition in the gummy dietary supplement category which has grown from six brands to over 170 in the last nine years shifting consumer behavior including accelerated shifts to online shopping which has been accelerated by the covid19 pandemic have also increased competition in ecommerce in many of our categories from our larger legacy competitors and newer digitally native brands which have increasingly moved into consumer products and staples 

many of our competitors are large companies including among others the proctor  gamble company the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson nestle purina petcare company and nestle health science ansell limited alere inc pfizer inc bayer ag sc johnson  son inc pharmavite llc  koninklijke philips nv unilever plc sanofi and nbty inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and therefore have the capacity to outspend us on advertising and promotional activities and introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can 

our products generally compete on the basis of performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers significant price competition may require us to reduce the prices for some of our products or price levels that do not offset manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share increases to our prices as a result of inflationary pressures or otherwise could cause sales of those products to decline we have recently raised prices on many of our products and expect to take pricing actions on 80 of our global portfolio of brands by the end of february 2022 advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on retail customer decisions regarding the brands and product lines they sell and on consumer purchasing decisions a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if our advertising marketing and promotional programs are not effective our sales growth may decline  



a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our net sales andor net sales of specific product lines walmart is our largest customer accounting for approximately 24 of net sales in 2021 23 of net sales in 2020 and 24 of net sales in 2019 our top three customers accounted for approximately 37 of net sales in 2021 and 36 of net sales each year in 2020 and 2019 we expect that a significant portion of our net sales will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues as a result changes in the strategies of walmart or any of our other largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or of shelf space they dedicate to private label products could materially harm our net sales and profitability changes in consumer behavior including continued shifting to online shopping instead of physical retail shopping as a result of the covid19 pandemic and other trends could also impact our sales to our largest customers some of our retail customers have been forced to shut down or reduce their hours which has impacted and may continue to impact their orders some of our retail customers have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all if these impacts are prolonged they can further increase the difficulty of planning for operations moreover the use of evolving technology by our customers to develop more complex pricing models may lead to category pricing pressures we could also lose a significant customer due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues as our business is based primarily upon individual sales orders rather than longterm contracts and most customer agreements include customer termination rights after short notice many of our customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from us at any time and for any reason 

 



factors that can affect demand include competitors’ products advertising and pricing actions rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs including increased costs as a result of changes in federal regulations significant shifts in government policies the deterioration of economic or trade relations between countries or regions commodity costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior including gasoline and home heating oil pricing reduced unemployment benefits in periods of high unemployment including the historically high unemployment rates resulting from the covid19 pandemic inflationary pressures restrictions on travel and access to public spaces and changes in tax policies other effects of governmental shutdowns or a lapse of appropriations or fear of exposure to or actual impacts of a widespread disease outbreak such as covid19 in particular we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of laundry detergent and the continued customer demand for these products are critical to our future success some products have seen decreasing demand in recent years including condoms as a result of demographic and other changes an increasing number of our products are more durable in nature and therefore are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending

changes resulting from the covid19 impact may also impact demand for our vitamin and supplement products the vitamins and supplements and cold remedy categories have seen increased demand as trends in health and wellness focus have accelerated however demand for these products has typically increased during winter months when consumers have increased rates of flu and cold infection and increased social distancing and flu vaccination rates may have a negative impact



despite increasing shifts to ecommerce sales of our products remain strongest in the traditional mass merchandiser food and drug retail stores and our products are also sold in club stores and dollar stores channels however alternative retail channels including ecommerce retailers hard discounters subscription services and buying clubs have become more prevalent and the volume of consumer products that are sold through such alternative retail channels is continuing to increase which may affect customer and consumer preferences including in response to the covid19 pandemic and market dynamics including any pricing pressures for consumer goods as retailers face added costs to build their ecommerce capacity further consumer preferences continue to evolve due to a number of factors including fragmentation of the consumer market and changes in consumer demographics including the aging of the general population and the emergence of millennials and generation z who have different spending consumption and purchasing habits evolving consumer concerns or perceptions regarding esg practices of manufacturers including packaging materials such as plastic packaging and their environmental impact greenhouse gas emissions waste disposal practices a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients changing consumer sentiment toward nonlocal products or sources among millennials and other demographic groups evolving consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products and concerns regarding human capital practices including dei 

the movement of consumers to online purchases of consumer products has greatly accelerated as a result of the covid19 pandemic as store closures quarantine and gathering restrictions and social distancing efforts have reduced physical retail shopping we and many of our competitors have increased our online sales as a result benefiting from scale brand recognition and other factors however as consumers continue to shift their behavior retailers may incur higher ecommerce operating costs and will seek to recover those costs by passing them onto customers and manufacturers additionally we cannot predict the extent to which our increased ecommerce demand will continue as pandemic conditions change including as a result of vaccines reduced rates of infection or modified consumer outlook and behaviors



larger and increasingly consolidated retailers have increasing influence and have sought to obtain lower pricing special packaging inventory practices logistics or other changes to the customersupplier relationship as a result of this influence to the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms to those customers our profit margins are reduced further if we are unable to effectively respond to the demands of our customers these customers could reduce their purchases of our products and increase their purchases of products from competitors  reductions in inventory by our customers including as a result of consolidation in the retail industry or these customers managing their working capital requirements could result in reduced orders for our products and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows for financial periods affected by such reductions 

protracted unfavorable market conditions including those caused by the covid19 pandemic have caused many of our customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell and reduce or discontinue certain of our product lines particularly those products that were not number one or two in their category 

in addition private label and retailbranded products sold by retail trade chains are typically sold at lower prices than branded products as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending our customers have discontinued or reduced distribution of some of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase the customers’ less expensive and in some cases more profitable private label and retailbranded products primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories 

 



we may continue to pursue and consummate additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future those acquisitions may be significantly larger than the ones completed in the past and may require us to increase our levels of debt potentially resulting in us being assigned a lower credit rating however we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisition at attractive valuations obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions in recent periods competition from other consumer products companies that are seeking similar opportunities has been particularly strong and valuations for potential acquisition assets have been high which has placed pressure on our ability to identify structure and execute transactions in addition acquisitions and investments entail various risks including the difficulty of entering new markets or product categories the challenges of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the ongoing business of the acquired company the need to review and if necessary upgrade processes and systems of the acquired company to conform to our own processes and systems and applicable legal and regulatory requirements managing an increasingly broad and complex range of businesses and products and generally our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment any of these risks may divert management and other resources require us to incur unanticipated costs or delay the anticipated positive impact on our business and results of the acquisition the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent we acquire businesses that have standalone operations or businesses that are in new categories that cannot easily be integrated or operations or sources of supply outside of the us and canada for which products are manufactured locally by third parties 

acquired companies or operations or newlycreated ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made in addition future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the potentially dilutive issuances of new equity by us or the incurrence of additional debt or business acquisition liabilities 



a significant percentage of our revenues come from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during 2021 approximately 82 of our sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes dietary supplements antiperspirants and deodorants our ability to quickly innovate to adapt our products to meet changing consumer demands is essential especially in light of ecommerce significantly reducing the barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers even if we are successful in increasing sales within our product categories a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for our products could have a negative impact on our financial results 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact most of our businesses as certain government restrictions were reduced or removed we have experienced increased demand for certain product categories mainly in the united states including arm  hammer® cat litter vitafusion® and l’il critters® gummy vitamins and batiste® dry shampoo that had been negatively impacted by the temporary and permanent closures of certain retailers earlier during the pandemic reduced consumer foot traffic at retailers and covid19 related precautionary measures overall we have continued to experience increased online sales potential recessionary economic conditions including after the direct impact of the pandemic has subsided may continue to impact consumer demand for certain of our products and put downward pressure on product prices 



our future performance and growth depend on our ability to successfully identify develop and introduce new products product line extensions products in adjacent categories to our current products and anticipate changes in consumer preferences in addition some of our products have shorter product life spans and depend heavily on our ability to continuously and timely introduce innovative new products to the marketplace the successful development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development marketing and promotional expenditures which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which we have limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays competitor actions regulatory approval hurdles and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products could result in a concomitant decline in sales of existing products  

each year we introduce new products including launches into new “white space” categories across the majority of our marketed brands however there is no assurance that our new products will continue to have widespread acceptance from time to time we have discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs we may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet retailer or consumer expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand  

 



from time to time we initiate planned and unplanned expansion projects with respect to our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers which are subject to risks of and we have from time to time experienced delay or cost overruns resulting from numerous factors including the following shortages of equipment materials or skilled labor work stoppages unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment unanticipated cost increases difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions difficulties in meeting regulatory or quality requirements or obtaining regulatory approvals availability of suppliers to certify equipment for existing and enhanced regulations design and engineering problems failure or delay of third party service providers and civil unrest labor disputes natural disasters and pandemics if we were to experience delays or cost overruns in the future it could result in product allocation and retailer frustration the loss of a significant customer or customers and the material decrease of the sales of one or more of our products in addition we could miscalculate our anticipated capacity needs in any of our categories such as our laundry detergent cat litter and dietary supplement categories including as a result of meeting the anticipated demand of our customers or expansion into new product lines or into new markets 

additionally the supply of our products depends on the uninterrupted efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers and our ability to meet customer service levels the manufacturing of certain of our products is concentrated in one or more of our plants contract manufacturers or other suppliers with limited alternate qualified facilities available many of our manufacturing processes and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers are complex and present difficult technical challenges to obtain the manufacturing yields necessary to operate profitably and may require complex and specialized equipment which can be expensive to repair or replace with required lead times of up to a year

any event that disrupts or otherwise negatively impacts manufacturing facilities manufacturing systems or equipment or contract manufacturers or other suppliers could result in the delivery of inferior products or our ability to meet customer requirements or service levels as the covid19 pandemic continues we could face challenges and retailer penalties in continuing to operate our facilities and delivery of on time and in full product shipments as a result of employee absenteeism or sickness additional governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers



we rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain of our commodities and raw materials including sole source suppliers for certain of our raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers must be qualified pursuant to our standards and may also have to be qualified under governmental and industry standards and any other standards of our customers which can require additional investment and time we could experience material disruptions in production and other supply chain issues largely because of shortages in supplier labor which continues to impact the availability of many raw and packaging materials which continues to result in outofstock conditions in addition continued outofstock supplies or products due to supply chain issues may cause our customers to switch to competitors’ products that are more available moreover our relationships with customers could be adversely affected if new or existing suppliers are unable to meet any standards set by us government or industry regulations or our customers if we are unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for our business if any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent ceases or significantly reduces its operations or experiences financial distress as a result of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise or if any environmental economic or other outside factors impact its operations we may be unable to qualify any needed new contract manufacturers or suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships based on a variety of factors we may be unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for our business certain of our suppliers may not meet the standards of our customers or licensors or certain of our key contract manufacturers or suppliers may become insolvent or experience other financial distress or face closure or suspension of operations if any of these events occurs and we have failed to identify and qualify an alternative vendor then we may be unable to meet our contractual obligations and customer expectations which could damage our reputation and result in lost customers and sales or the incurrence of fines or higher than expected expenses  further the covid19 pandemic has caused worldwide increases in demand for some products and reduced demand for other products which has caused strain on our supply chain network and its ability to meet such demand 



the principal raw materials and packaging used by us and certain of our suppliers and contract manufacturers include surfactants cleaning agents paper products and resinbased molded components volatility and increases in the price of raw materials disruptions in production or transportation or increases in the costs of energy labor shipping and other necessary services could significantly affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution significant inflation of material component and copacker costs impacted our gross margin in 2021 there is no assurance that we will be able to fully offset any price increases through cost reduction programs or price increases of our products or enter lockedin price arrangements or hedge agreements especially given the competitive environment sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales 

 

declines and loss of market share while we seek to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume our projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases   in addition volatility in certain commodity markets could significantly affect our production cost  

from time to time we use hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of commodities and diesel fuel prices the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to product costs enabling us to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in prices over the term of the contract however in periods of declining fuel or other commodity prices the hedge agreements can have the effect of locking us in at abovemarket prices  



we distribute our products and receive raw materials and packaging components primarily by truck rail and ship and through various ports of entry reduced availability of trucking rail or shipping capacity due to adverse weather conditions natural disasters including climatic events including any potential effect of climate change allocation of assets to other industries or geographies or otherwise work stoppages closure of operations due to government restrictions or sick employees or other impacts of pandemics strikes or shutdowns of ports of entry or such transportation sources could lead to inflationary cost pressures cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials or packaging components in a timely manner which could disrupt our operations strain our customer relationships and competitive position 



our financial success is directly dependent on the reputation and success of our brands particularly the arm  hammer batiste first response nair orajel oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion spinbrush waterpik xtra flawless zicam and therabreath brands the effectiveness of these brands could suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers our brands could suffer damage to their reputations due to real or perceived sustainability quality or safety issues including as a result of among other things significant product recalls productrelated litigation defects or impurities in our products product misuse changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or allegations of product tampering in addition as our sales on various ecommerce platforms grow we may be unable to prevent sales of counterfeit pirated or stolen goods unlawful or unethical sales unauthorized resellers online or sales in violation of our policies 

additionally claims made in our marketing campaigns may become subject to litigation alleging false advertising and could cause us to alter our marketing plans and may affect sales or result in the imposition of significant damages against us 

 

widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility and speed of dissemination of negative information negative online consumer reviews or inaccurate posting or comments about us or our brands in the media or on any social networking website whether accurate or inaccurate or the disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information through social media could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands in addition given the association of our individual products with us an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products or us as a whole 



our ability to continue to grow our sales and profits is dependent on expanding in the locations in which we already do business and entering into new geographic locations both of which require significant resources and investments which would affect our risk profile further our international operations subject us to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 























 









the covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a negative impact on regional and global economies with reduced international travel restrictions and social distancing measures and recessionary conditions in many countries major developments in trade relations including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the us andor other countries and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing all the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to commercialize our products on a competitive basis in international markets

in addition changes as result of the united kingdom’s decision and subsequent negotiations to exit the eu could subject us to heightened risks in that region including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods services and people to and from the united kingdom increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and additional legal and economic uncertainty additional costs have been incurred in 2020 and 2021 because of measures implemented to address or mitigate risks moreover in all foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions the recent imposition of tariffs on products imported from certain countries has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries major developments in trade relations including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the us andor other countries and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which in turn could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations all the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to commercialize our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows or financial position 



the market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and brand names we own the material trademarks and brand names used in connection with the marketing and distribution of our major products both in the us and in other countries while we hold several valuable patents on our products they may not serve as an effective barrier to entry for new competitors accordingly we rely on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights although most of our material intellectual property is registered in the us and in certain foreign countries in which we operate we cannot be sure that our intellectual property rights will be sufficient or effectively utilized or if necessary successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future and we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties infringe our intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with our brands and harm our sales our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition if our products are found to infringe intellectual property rights of others the owners of those rights could bring legal actions against us claiming substantial damages for past infringement and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products if these legal actions are successful in addition to any potential liability for damages from past infringement we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products potentially adding significant costs we might not prevail in any action brought against us or we may be unsuccessful in securing any license for continued use and therefore have to discontinue the marketing and sale of a product 



we have a material amount of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets as well as other longlived tangible assets which are periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards declines in our profitability andor estimated cash flows related to specific intangible assets as well as potential changes in market valuations for similar assets and market discount rates has resulted in impairment charges from time to time and may result in future impairment charges  

 

 

 

regulatory and litigation risks

 



from time to time we are subject to product liability or other productrelated claims we may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by our products including losses or injuries caused by raw materials or other components provided by third party suppliers that are included in our products claims could be based on allegations that among other things our products contain contaminants are improperly tested labeled or designed or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings of potential dangers related to their use whether or not successful product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm our sales and operating results and the reputation of our brands in addition if one of our products is found to be defective or noncompliant with applicable rules or regulations we could be required to withdraw or recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability and product recall insurance coverage potential product liability or other productrelated damages claims andor withdrawal and recall costs may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy 



from time to time we are the subject of or party to various pending or threatened legal actions including class actions government investigations and proceedings including without limitation those relating to commercial transactions product liability consumer employment antitrust environmental health safety and compliancerelated matters such proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of certain pending or threatened legal actions investigations and proceedings may not be reasonably predictable and any related damages injunctions andor settlements may not be estimable   



we must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations 



as climate change land use water use deforestation recyclability or recoverability of packaging plastic waste ingredients and other esg concerns become more prevalent federal state and local governments nongovernmental organizations and our customers consumers and investors are increasingly concerned about these issues their requirements and preferences could negatively impact the company’s ability to obtain raw materials or could increase its acquisition and compliance costs or cause the company to contribute funds to recycling and other waste management infrastructure thus making our products more costly less competitive than other competitive products or reduce consumer demand this increased focus on esg may result in new laws regulations and requirements that could cause disruptions in or increased costs associated with manufacturing our products this could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with any of the foregoing we could also lose revenue if our consumers change brands or our customers move business from us because we have not complied with their esg requirements and esgconscious investors may choose not to invest in our common stock if we do not comply with their business expectations 

we have recognized that our customers and consumers are increasingly demanding transparency regarding our efforts to mitigate our impacts on climate change for example during 2021 some of our major customers requested we respond to various questionnaires including the climate disclosure project “cdp” climate change and forests questionnaires and use our responses and cdp grades to evaluate us efforts to meet these standards could impact our costs and failure to meet our customers’ expectations could impact our sales

certain of our business activities and the production of some of the materials used in our products and certain of our business activities including petroleum based agricultural and forest materials and the growing global demand for livestock products which is a focus of our animal and food production business contribute to deforestation and climate change and reduction in biodiversity and can adversely impact water quality and availability people and communities climate change is in turn a threat to each of those activities while we strive to minimize the environmental impact of our global operations a potential loss in business could result from reduced demand for our products and loss of customers if we do not meet their expectations related to our efforts towards sustainability and fighting climate change

 



the development manufacturing processing formulation including stability packaging labeling marketing distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the ftc the epa and the cpsc and foreign regulators and agencies in addition our and our suppliers’ operations are subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which our products and their constituent materials and components are manufactured and sold  

in particular the fda and foreign counterparts regulate the formulation safety development manufacturing packaging labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits vaginal lubricants electric and battery powered medical devices overthecounter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements including vitamins minerals and homeopathic products the fda or a similar foreign agency also exercises oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of our other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that we and our suppliers use to manufacture regulated products and may identify compliance issues that would require us and our suppliers to make certain changes in our manufacturing facilities and processes the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to regulatory action against the products made in that facility including seizure injunction or recall as well as to possible action against the owner of the facilitymanufacturer we may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until the compliance issue has been remediated 

likewise any future determination by the fda or a similar foreign agency or by us in reviewing our compliance with applicable rules and regulations that our products or quality systems do not comply with applicable regulations could result in future compliance activities including product withdrawals or recalls import detentions injunctions preventing the shipment of products or other enforcement actions for example the fda may determine that a particular claim that we use to support the marketing of a product is not substantiated may not accept the evidence of safety for a new product that we may wish to market may challenge the safety or effectiveness of existing products based on among other things changes in formulations inadequate stability or “shelflife” consumer complaints or improper labeling and may determine that our dietary supplement business manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations do not comply with cgmps similarly we may identify these or other issues in internal compliance reviews of our operations and the operations and products of vendors and acquired companies these other issues may include the identification of contaminants or noncompliant levels of particular ingredients any of the foregoing could subject us to adverse publicity force us to incur unanticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  additionally delays in the acceptance review and approval of products by the fda or other required governmental approvals may result from government shutdowns due to the failure by congress to enact regular appropriations 

in 2019 our vitafusion brand launched cbd full spectrum hemp extract gummies a new product line made with full spectrum hemp extract containing cannabidiol “cbd” hemp was exempted from federal regulation as a controlled substance under the agriculture improvement act of 2018 the “2018 farm bill” the 2018 farm bill did not eliminate or affect regulation of hemp and its derivatives by the fda ftc or state governments we believe that our new product line complies with applicable fda requirements although the fda takes the position that cbd products cannot be marketed as dietary supplements and that cbd cannot be added to food to date the fda’s enforcement activity has focused primarily on cbd products that bear express or implied claims suggesting that the products are intended to treat cure prevent or mitigate a disease the ftc has similarly focused on disease claims our products do not bear disease claims

the fda has not confirmed whether it will engage in rulemaking to permit the marketing of cbd products as dietary supplements in the interim there has been discussion of legislative changes for example s 1698 was introduced in may 2021 s 1698 would amend the fdc act to include hempderived cbd in the definition of a dietary supplement although state laws have been evolving in the wake of the 2018 farm bill we do not intend to sell our products in states that continue to prohibit sales of certain hempbased cbd products in 2021 our nair brand is launching one depilatory cosmetic product that contains broad spectrum hemp extract fda’s position that cbd products cannot be marketed as dietary supplements and that cbd cannot be added to food does not extend to cosmetic products we do not intend to sell our nair product in states that continue to prohibit sales of certain hempbased cbd products the fda and certain states and local governments may enact regulations or change their enforcement priorities in a manner that further limits the marketing and use of cbd products we do not know what the impact of such regulatory activities would be on our products and what costs requirements and possible prohibitions may be associated with such regulatory activities our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or fda’s or any other state’s disagreeing with our interpretation of applicable fda or state requirements could result in among other things administrative civil or criminal penalties or fines product seizure mandatory or voluntary product recalls warning or untitled letters cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance closure of facilities or operations the loss revocation or modification of any existing licenses permits registrations or approvals or the failure to obtain additional licenses permits registrations or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business these laws and regulations may change in the future and we may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current or future laws and regulations or in any product recalls

we are subject to regulations regarding the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment as well as the commission’s rules with respect to “conflict minerals” the new administration and congress in the united states may seek to pass more stringent regulations in these areas or more aggressively enforce existing regulations recent trade policies tariffs and government 

 

regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries have introduced greater uncertainty and volatility in addition any additional or renewed significant governmental actions pertaining to the covid19 pandemic including lockdowns quarantines or other restrictions on the ability of our employees to travel or perform necessary business functions or our ability to develop manufacture distribute market or sell our products or the ability of our suppliers customers or thirdparty partners to effectively run their operations may negatively impact our ability to manufacture distribute market and sell our products   we are not able to predict the nature of these changes or of such future laws regulations repeals or interpretations or to predict the effect additional or shifting governmental regulation when and if it occurs would have on our business in the future such developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated additional recordkeeping requirements increased documentation of the properties of certain products additional or different labeling additional scientific substantiation expanded adverse event reporting or other new requirements 

there is also an increased risk of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls additionally we could be subject to future inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies which may be delayed or disrupted due to any government furlough we could also be adversely affected by violations or allegations of violations of the foreign corrupt practices act and similar international antibribery laws the foreign corrupt practices act and similar international antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 



 

we collect use and store personal data of our employees customers and other third parties in the ordinary course of business and we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy and security laws and regulations that apply to the collection storage use transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer and employee data including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries recent highprofile security breaches of the information systems of a number of government agencies and us companies may result in increased regulations and new security laws the new administration and congress in the united states may seek to pass more stringent regulations in these areas or more aggressively enforce existing regulations

 

numerous local municipal state federal and international law and regulations address privacy and security including the california online privacy protection act the personal information protection and electronic documents act the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing canspam act the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa section 5c of the federal trade commission act and effective as of january 1 2020 the california consumer privacy act ccpa these privacy and security laws and regulations change frequently and new legislation continues to be introduced such as the virginia consumer data protection act and the colorado privacy act which will become effective in 2023 in particular the ccpa requires new disclosures to california consumers  gives california consumers new rights with respect to their data and permits california consumers to optout of certain sales of personal information the ccpa provides for fines of up to 7500 per violation

 

in europe the european union eu has adopted strict data privacy regulations following the passage of the eu’s general data protection regulation eu 2016679 “gdpr” and the regulation on privacy and electronic communications the “eprivacy regulation” data privacy and security compliance in the eu are increasingly complex and challenging the gdpr in particular has broad extraterritorial effect and imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with significant penalties for noncompliance up to 4 of worldwide annual turnover or €20 million whichever is higher it is also important to note that many countries are following the eu in producing a broad omnibus law in relation to privacy protection for instance brazil has just published a gdprlike law in general the gdpr and eprivacy regulation ccpa and other local privacy laws could also require adaptation of our technologies or practices increased costs and changes to operations to satisfy local privacy requirements and standards 

 

we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines penalties or orders to cease delay or modify collection use or transfers of personal data we could also face rights requests complaints claims or litigation from those persons whose data we collect use and store as well as government investigations and fines any of these events or other circumstances related to our collection use and transfer of personal data could also lead to negative media attention damage to our reputation in the market or otherwise adversely affect our business



our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in addition we evaluate our deferred income tax assets and record a valuation allowance if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized if the actual amount of our future taxable income is less than the amount we are currently projecting with respect to specific tax jurisdictions or if there is a change in the time period within which the deferred tax asset becomes deductible we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets the recording of a valuation allowance would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on our operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our 

 

deferred tax assets or liability balances which would also impact our effective tax rate the biden administration has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax policies in the united states and m ajor developments in tax policy could impact our business  



 

significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we provide for uncertain tax positions with respect to tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards mandated by applicable accounting guidance fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results we are regularly under audit by tax authorities and although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 



our amended and restated bylaws include an “exclusive forum provision which may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers if a court outside of delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations or cash flows

 

financial risks



as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 2563 million of total consolidated indebtedness net of debt issuance costs this amount of indebtedness could have important consequences including













additionally our credit facility is subject to certain financial and other customary covenants  in the event of a breach of those covenants our lenders under the credit facility may be entitled to accelerate the related debt and any lenders in respect of any other debt to which a crossdefault provision applies may be entitled to accelerate such other debt and we could be required to seek amendments or waivers under the debt instruments or to refinance the debt we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes if additional new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify a substantial increase in our indebtedness could also have a negative impact on our credit ratings  in this regard a deterioration in our credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate available to us in future financings as well as our liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets any decision regarding future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time including market conditions and impact to our credit ratings  

libor the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt including our revolving credit facility term loan and interest rate swaps was expected to be fully phased out by the end of 2021 when privatesector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate however in late 2020 ice benchmark administration “iba” the organization responsible for administering libor announced its intention to extend the publication of certain usd libor tenors until june 30 2023 the alternative 

 

reference rates committee “arrc” a group convened for the purpose of ensuring a successful transition away from usd libor has identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as its preferred alternative rate   given the inherent differences between libor and sofr or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established there are additional uncertainties regarding a transition from libor including but not limited to the need to amend all contracts with libor as the reference rate and how this will impact our cost of variable rate debt and certain derivative financial instruments we will also need to consider new contracts and if they should reference an alternative benchmark rate or include suggested fallback language as published by the arrc from time to time  



we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk both transaction and translation with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar outside of the us sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the canadian dollar euro pound mexican peso and australian dollar among others a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we purchase materials and services in foreign markets although we from time to time enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed sales or purchases denominated in the us dollar canadian dollar pound euro mexican peso and australian dollar foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

general risks



our business and financial results have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of the covid19 pandemic such as but not limited to

 





















despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as thirdparty or governmental actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects while the vast majority of our products are consumer staples that generally are less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products some of our products particularly waterpik and some other personal care brands are more discretionary in nature and are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending and the impact and duration of recessionary economic conditions

the impact of covid19 including the impact of restrictions imposed to combat its spread could result in additional businesses being shut down additional work restrictions and supply chains being interrupted slowed or rendered inoperable in particular as new covid19 variants such as the delta and omicron and other new variants spread as a result it may be even more challenging to obtain and process raw 

 

materials to support our business needs and more individuals could become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work andor travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions also governments may impose other laws regulations or taxes which could adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations further as some of our customers’ businesses are similarly affected they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of our business financial condition or results of operations the potential effects of covid19 also could impact many of the other risk factors described herein but given the evolving health economic social and governmental environments such potential impact remains uncertain while we expect the impacts of covid19 to continue to have an effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows  we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time 

 



our operations as well as the operations of our thirdparty manufacturers suppliers and customers may be subject to disruption from a variety of causes including a protracted economic downturn material shortages financial difficulties work stoppages cyberattacks and other disruptions in information technology systems demonstrations political instability or uncertainty in the us or abroad rising geopolitical tensions and hostilities for example between russia and ukraine and china and taiwan disease outbreaks or pandemics for example an outbreak of a virus such as covid19 acts of war terrorism fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters disruptions in logistics loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites supplier capacity constraints raw material and product quality or safety issues industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations 

the global economy and the economies in regions in which we conduct business have experienced substantial economic downturns as a result of the covid19 pandemic we are currently experiencing reduced demand for certain of our consumer products and may in the future be adversely affected in a material way by lower consumer demand as a result of recessionary economic conditions including after the direct impact of the covid19 pandemic has subsided in addition ongoing political uncertainty in many countries including the ongoing political transition in hong kong and the exit of the united kingdom from the european union have created additional economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets



we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to conduct our business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to internal communications and communications with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers billing customers and receiving and applying payment processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements collecting and storing customer consumer employee investor and other stakeholder information and personal data and other processes necessary to manage our business we sell certain of our products directly to consumers online and through websites mobile apps and connected devices and we offer promotions rebates customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and we or our vendors could experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that may result in unauthorized access disclosure and misuse of consumer customer employee vendor or company information 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including ransomware denial of service and phishing attacks and advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems networks and services and those of our customers and other business partners as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and the data of our customers and other business partners as a result our information technology systems networks or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or we could suffer a loss or disclosure of business personal or stakeholder information due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages and security breaches although we have business continuity plans in place and have implemented a breach response plan to address service interruptions if these plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct our operations which may adversely affect our business in addition if our service providers suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations moreover any costs related to a breach may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of our cybersecurity policy recently there have been high profile security breaches of the information systems of a number of government agencies and us companies resulting in significant disruptions

our information technology systems and our thirdparty providers’ systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing social engineering hacking and other cyberattacks such attacks may originate from nation states or attempts by outside parties hackers criminal organizations or other threat actors in addition insider actorsmalicious or otherwisecould cause technical disruptions andor confidential 

 

data leakage to date we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks however we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers’ databases or systems in addition although we have policies and procedures in place governing the secure storage of personal information collected by us or our thirdparty service providers data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct may occur in the future 

 

we continuously perform enterprisewide upgrades to our systems and will continue to monitor and upgrade systems as appropriate legacy systems may be vulnerable to increased risk additionally if a new system does not function properly it could affect our ability to order supplies process and deliver customer orders and process and receive payments for our products this could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows upgraded or new technology may not function as designed and any such upgrades may not go as planned moreover because the techniques tools and tactics used in cyberattacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack as such we may need to expend additional resources and incur additional costs in the future to continue to protect against or address problems caused by any business interruptions or data security breaches



the labor market in the united states is very competitive our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel including at our plants competition for qualified plant personnel has been intense the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees including as a result of illness to themselves or their families due to the covid19 pandemic or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations this effect could be exacerbated if any officers or other key personnel left as a group or at the same time our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified and diverse personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future  factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of key employees include employee morale our reputation competition from other employers and the availability of qualified personnel in a tightening labor market we have experienced increased levels of personnel turnover in recent years increasing from an employee turnover rate of 149 in 2020 to an employee turnover rate of 206 in 2021 we may continue to experience increased personnel turnover in the future compared to prior years either as a result of our business operations or as a result of the covid19 pandemic or other broadbased economic or cultural factors 



our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected our continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets such as our acquisition of waterpik flawless passport zicam therabreath and others may place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting and require us to update our internal control over financial reporting to integrate such acquisitions moreover we engage the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes which injects additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control when we are required to comply with new or revised accounting standards we must make any appropriate changes to our internal control over financial reporting to fully implement the standards which may require significant effort and judgment any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our results of operations accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to regulatory enforcement action and stockholder claims



in recent years proxy contests unsolicited takeovers and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous companies in our industry including us if such a campaign or proposal were to be made against us we would likely incur significant costs stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance strategic direction and operations of our business through stockholder proposals or otherwise disrupting our business and diverting the attention of our management and employees and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities the perception that we need a change in the direction of our business or the perception that we are unstable or lack continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to our current or potential customers and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business we may also be the target of short sellers who engage in negative publicity campaigns that may use selective information that may be presented out of context or that may misrepresent facts and circumstances

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 

overview

our business

we develop manufacture and market a broad range of consumer household personal care and specialty products focused on animal and food production chemicals and cleaners we focus our consumer products marketing efforts principally on our 14 “power brands” these wellrecognized brand names include arm  hammer ®  used in multiple product categories such as baking soda cat litter carpet deodorization and laundry detergent trojan ® condoms lubricants and vibrators oxiclean ® stain removers cleaning solutions laundry detergent and bleach alternatives spinbrush ® batteryoperated and manual toothbrushes first response ® home pregnancy and ovulation test kits nair ® depilatories orajel ® oral analgesic xtra ® laundry detergent l’il critters ® and vitafusion ® gummy dietary supplements batiste ® dry shampoos waterpik ® water flossers and replacement showerheads flawless ® products zicam ® cold shortening and relief products and therabreath® oral care products 

we sell our consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets mass merchandisers wholesale clubs drugstores convenience stores home stores dollar pet and other specialty stores and websites and other ecommerce channels all of which sell the products to consumers we sell our specialty products to industrial customers livestock producers and through distributors

we operate our business in three segments consumer domestic consumer international and the specialty products division “spd” the segments are based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures in 2021 the consumer domestic consumer international and spd segments represented approximately 76 18 and 6 respectively of our consolidated net sales

 

covid19 pandemic and other recent developments 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact most of our businesses as certain government restrictions were reduced or removed we have experienced increased demand for certain product categories mainly in the united states including arm  hammer cat litter vitafusion and l’il critters gummy vitamins and batiste dry shampoo that had been negatively impacted by the temporary and permanent closures of certain retailers reduced consumer foot traffic at retailers and covid19 related precautionary measures overall we have continued to experience increased online sales

we continue to experience challenges to meet customer demand largely because of broadbased shortages in suppliers’ labor which impact the availability of many critical components in our supply chain and distribution additionally we and our suppliers are experiencing significant broadbased inflation of manufacturing and distribution costs as well as transportation challenges we expect shortages to continue at least through the first half of 2022 and input cost inflation to continue at least throughout 2022 

to attempt to offset some of these cost pressures we have recently enacted and continue to evaluate price increases in addition to address challenges meeting customer demand we have taken steps to increase our shortterm manufacturing capacity for many of our products including laundry detergent baking soda cleaners and vitamins as well as our raw material and packaging capacity and continue to work closely with our suppliers contract manufacturers and retail partners to increase capacity and ensure sustained supply to keep pace with increased demand we have also made investments in the expansion of longterm inhouse and thirdparty manufacturing capacity and are working to enlist additional suppliers that meet our quality specifications while we expect supply availability issues to start improving in the second half of 2022 for most of our brands there is no assurance that these challenges will abate in the foreseeable future or that our customers will accept all or a portion of any price increases or that the other measures we have or may implement will mitigate the impact of supply disruptions or rising costs

looking forward the extent that covid19 and other recent developments’ have on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration spread and intensity of the pandemic the spread and severity of new variants such as omicron the impact of vaccines and our continued ability to manufacture and distribute our products as well as any future government actions affecting employers consumers and the economy generally all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape our priorities during the covid19 pandemic continue to be protecting the health and safety of our employees maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health hygiene and cleaning needs and using our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges

we are monitoring the impact of both inflation and the covid19 pandemic including the effect of corresponding government actions on consumer demand and how these factors will potentially influence future cash flows for the short and long term while we expect that many of these effects will not be permanent it is impossible to predict their duration 

2021 financial highlights 

key 2021 financial results include













strategic goals challenges and initiatives

our ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for our products and retail customers’ decisions to carry our products which are in part affected by general economic conditions in our markets while a vast majority of our products are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products an increasing number of our products particularly those from our recent acquisitions are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories launching their own brands and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category in addition an increasing portion of our product categories are being sold by club stores dollar stores mass merchandisers and internetbased retailers these factors have placed downward pressure on our sales and gross margins

we intend to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives maintain competitive marketing and trade spending tightly control our cost structure continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursue strategic acquisitions we also intend to continue to grow our product sales globally and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products to appeal to a wide range of consumers

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of liquid laundry detergent as a result any delays or reduction of sales of these products in the event that our product category diversification efforts discussed below are not successful could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and cash flows condom usage has declined over the last decade however a fter a large decline in condom sales during 2020 due to social distancing the condom category began to recover in 2021 with fewer social restrictions leading to an increase in sexual activity however there is no assurance the category will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline 

we are continuously focused on strengthening our key brands through the launch of innovative new products which span various product categories including premium and value household products supported by increased marketing and trade spending there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 

in the domestic business six out of 13 “power brands” met or exceeded category growth for the full year 2021 with the acquisition of therabreath we now have 14 “power brands” our global product portfolio consists of both premium 60 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2021 and value 40 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2021 brands which we believe enables us to succeed in a range of economic environments we intend to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among costconscious consumers

over the past two decades  we ha ve diversified from an almost exclusively us business to a global company with approximately 18  of sales derive d from countries outside of the united states in 20 2 1  we ha ve subsidiary operations in seven countries canada mexico uk france germany china and australia and sell in to over 130 other countries  in 20 2 1  we benefited from our expanded global footprint and expect to continue to focus on selectively expanding our global business if we are unable to expand our business internationally at the rate that we expect we may not realize our anticipated growth targets  

although we believe ongoing international expansion represents a significant opportunity to grow our business our increasing activity in global markets exposes us to additional complexity and uncertainty sales generated outside of the us are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as political uncertainty which could impact future operating results moreover the current domestic and international political environment including existing and potential changes to us policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty regarding the global economy the impact of us tariffs on certain products was a component of increased cost of sale during the year ended december 31 2021 the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we manufacture or sell large quantities of products could negatively impact our business cash flows results of operations and financial condition

we also continue to focus on controlling our costs historically we have been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent by passing along cost increases to customers we have also entered into set pricing and prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel and other commodities additionally our focus on tight cost controls has enabled us to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions in 2021 due to the significant increase in input costs we have not been able to fully mitigate the impact of these increases with cost control measures and productivity programs we have and will continue to implement price increases to address cost inflation however we cannot be certain that these price increases will be accepted by customers

the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of our overall strategy and product category diversification acquisitions have added significantly to our sales and profits and product category diversification over the last decade this is evidenced by our 2015 acquisition of certain assets of varied industries corporation the “vicor acquisition” the 2016 acquisitions of spencer forrest inc the maker of toppik the “toppik acquisition” and the anusol and rectinol businesses from johnson  johnson the “anusol acquisition” the 2017 acquisitions of viviscal from lifes2good holdings limited the “viviscal acquisition” agro biosciences inc the “agro acquisition” and waterpik from pik holdings inc the “waterpik acquisition” the 2018 acquisition of passport food safety solutions inc the “passport acquisition” the 2019 acquisition of flawless the 2020 acquisition of zicam from consumer health holdco llc and the 2021 acquisition of therabreath from dr harold katz llc and hkip international inc the failure to effectively identify or integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause us to incur material asset writedowns we actively seek acquisitions that fit our guidelines and our strong financial position provides us with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in addition our ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled us to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions since 2001 we have acquired 13 of our 14 “power brands” 

we believe we are positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to our strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives our focus is to maintain competitive marketing and trade spending manage our cost structure continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products while pursuing strategic acquisitions this focus together with the strength of our portfolio of premium and value brands has enabled us to succeed in a range of economic environments  moreover the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations combined with an investment grade credit rating provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions drive new product development make capital expenditures to support organic growth and gross margin improvements return cash to stockholders through dividends and share buy backs and reduce outstanding debt these factors position us to continue to increase stockholder value over the longterm

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty they are based on our historical experience our observation of trends in industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate our significant accounting policies and estimates are described below 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves

virtually all of our revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by our customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for our products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements and coupons are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold we rely on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example we use historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements a difference of approximately 01 in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns we use experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if our estimates for promotional activities and sales returns reserves were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 113 while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations 

impairment of goodwill trade names and other intangible assets 

carrying values of goodwill and indefinitelived trade names are reviewed periodically for possible impairment  finite intangible assets are assessed when there are business triggering events our impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate and royalty rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trade names and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired the result of our annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units in addition there were no goodwill impairment charges for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2021

 

fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” or “excess earnings” discounted cash flow method which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change and therefore could impact fair values in the future we determined that the fair value of all intangible assets for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2021 exceeded their respective carrying values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability however in recent years our trojan business specifically the condom category has not grown and competition has increased resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flows in addition the covid19 pandemic has further negatively impacted condom sales due to social distancing as a result the trojan business has experienced sales and profit declines that has eroded a significant portion of the excess between the fair and carrying value of the tradename which if these trends continue could potentially result in an impairment however the condom category began to recover in 2021 as fewer social restrictions led to an increase in sexual activity with less shutdowns and governmental restrictions while management can and has implemented strategies to address the risk significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of these assets 

it is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if for example i the businesses or brands do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded

companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

income taxes

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized we record liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under us gaap guidelines the liabilities relate to tax return positions that although supportable by us may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement we adjust this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change in this regard settlement of any issue or an adverse determination in litigation with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate conversely favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate

sga expenses for 20 2 1 were  6067  a n increase of  134 or 23  compared to 2020  the increase is primarily due to higher expense s related to the zicam acquisition including amortization asset impairment charges of 113 associated with the passport business acquired in 2018  and the prior year gain on the sale of perl weiss ®  partially offset by lower incentive compensation and litigation costs  sga as a percentage of net sales de creased 40 bps to 117  in 2021 compared to 121  in 2020  the de crease is due to 70 bps of leverage associated with higher sales offset by 30 bps on higher expen ses   the favorable adjustment to the fair value of the flawless business acquisition liability  which is recognized as a reduction in expense was 980 in 2021 compared to 940 in 2020

in recent years our trojan business specifically the condom category had not grown and competition has increased social distancing requirements due to the covid19 pandemic had further negatively impacted the business as a result the trojan business had experienced stagnant sales and profits resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flows which eroded a portion of the excess between the fair and carrying value of the tradename this indefinitelived intangible asset may be susceptible to impairment risk and a continued decline in fair value could trigger a future impairment charge of the trojan tradename while management can and has implemented strategies to address the risk including lowering our production costs investing in new product ideas and developing new creative advertising significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair value in 2021 trojan experienced a recovery in sales and profits as it is benefiting from an easing of covid19 social restrictions leading to an increase in sexual activity we expect this trend will continue into next year with the continued adoption of vaccines the reduction of social distancing restrictions and the benefit of management strategies to improve sales and profitability

consumer domestic income before income taxes for 2021 was 8614 a 290 increase as compared to 2020 the increase is due primarily to favorable pricemix of 1356 a 310 benefit from higher sales volumes  lower marketing expenses of 186 lower sga expenses of 103 including a 33 favorable yearoveryear fair value adjustment to the flawless business acquisition liability and lower interest and other expenses of 58 mostly offset by unfavorable manufacturing and distribution expenses of 1719

all amounts outstanding to suppliers participating in the scf program are recorded within accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows

the current economic environment presents risks that could have adverse consequences for our liquidity see the discussion of this and other risks under “risk factors” in item 1a of this annual report although there is uncertainty related to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our future results we believe our efficient business model and strong balance sheet position us to manage our business through this crisis we continue to manage all aspects of our business including but not limited to monitoring the financial health of our customers suppliers and other thirdparty relationships implementing gross margin enhancement strategies and developing new opportunities for growth we do not anticipate that current economic conditions will adversely affect our ability to comply with the financial covenant in the credit agreement because we currently are and anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio requirement under the credit agreement

sustainability and environmental social and governance “esg”

we believe that sustainable operations are both financially and operationally beneficial to our business and critical to the health of the communities in which we operate accordingly each year we publish a sustainability report that discloses our business and corporate responsibility commitments by detailing our environmental social and governance performance including our metrics and targets and other key components of our sustainability platform our 2019 sustainability report is available on our web site at httpschurchdwightcomresponsibilitysustainabilityreportsaspx and our 2020 sustainability report will be available in april 2021 the “2020 sustainability report” and together with the 2019 sustainability report the “sustainability reports” references to our sustainability reports are for informational purposes only and neither the sustainability reports nor the other information on our website is incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k see pages 1112 in this item 1 of this annual report under “employees and human capital” for a discussion of our human capital management 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations relating to environmental concerns including air emissions wastewater discharges solid and hazardous waste management activities and the safety of our employees we endeavor to take actions necessary to comply with such regulations these steps include periodic environmental and health and safety audits of our facilities the audits conducted by independent firms with expertise in environmental health and safety compliance include site visits at each location as well as a review of documentary information to determine compliance with such federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations however our environmental priorities extend beyond our compliance efforts

our global sustainability platform is one of our leadership strategies which we have derived from our heritage and organizational values the following six pillars are the core focus of our sustainability efforts  and are identified with their corresponding primary esg priorities 













our governance focus includes the processes resources and systems in support of our sustainability and esg efforts as well as our corporate governance which is separate from our sustainability program all as will be described in our proxy statement for our upcoming annual meeting of stockholders under the caption “sustainability and esg” and in our 2020 sustainability report our corporate issues council the “council” comprised of senior executives representing all of our key functional areas guides the integration of sustainability with all

specialty products division 

our spd segment focuses on sales to businesses and participates in three product areas animal and food production specialty chemicals and specialty cleaners and accounted for approximately 6 of our consolidated net sales in 2020   

animal and food production products 

since the arm  hammer animal and food production business began in 1972 with its launch of arm  hammer baking soda as a feed additive to help dairy cows produce more milk we have built a leading portfolio of nutritional supplements designed to help improve the health and productivity of dairy cows today our portfolio of dairy nutritional supplements includes brands such as megalac ® rumen bypass fat– a supplement made from natural oils – which enables cows to maintain energy levels during the period of high milk production resulting in improved milk yields in addition we market a line of highquality protein and amino acid products including biochlor ® and fermenten ®  which are designed to help reduce health issues associated with calving as well as provide needed protein to ensure proper growth and milk production

specialty chemicals

our specialty chemicals business primarily encompasses the manufacture marketing and sale of sodium bicarbonate in a range of grades and granulations for use in industrial markets in industrial markets sodium bicarbonate is used by other manufacturing companies as a leavening agent for commercial baked goods as an antacid in pharmaceuticals as a carbon dioxide release agent in fire extinguishers as an alkaline agent in swimming pool chemicals and as a buffer in kidney dialysis 

we and occidental chemical corporation are equal partners in a joint venture armand products company which manufactures and markets potassium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate for sale in domestic and international markets the potassiumbased products are used in a wide variety of applications including agricultural products specialty glass and ceramics and potassium silicates armand also manufactures a potassium carbonatebased animal feed additive for sale by us in the dairy industry described above under “ animal and food production products ” armand’s results are included in our corporate segment

competition

we compete in the household and personal care consumer product categories which are highly innovative categories characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and require significant advertising and promotion we compete in these categories primarily on the basis of product innovation and performance brand recognition price value and other consumer benefits consumer products particularly laundry and dietary supplements are subject to significant price competition as a result we from time to time may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share product introductions typically involve heavy marketing and trade spending in the year of launch and we usually are not able to determine whether the new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product line

because of the competitive retail environment we face pricing pressure from our retail customers and customers selling through other channels particularly highvolume retail customers including internetbased retailers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms that could reduce our margins furthermore if we are unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to our customers they could increase product purchases from competitors and reduce purchases from us which would harm our sales and profitability

 

our competitors in the consumer domestic and consumer international segments include  among others procter  gamble company “pg”  the clorox company colgatepalmolive company sc johnson  son inc nestle purina petcare company henkel reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson ansell limited pfizer inc bayer ag alere inc nbty inc  koninklijke philips nv unilever plc and pharmavite llc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and have the capacity to outspend us in their attempts to gain market share in addition the growing number of sales channels and business models such as niche brands internet  only brands and discounter channels have increased competition in certain product categories such as oral care from less well capitalized competitors 

competition within our animal and food production and our specialty chemicals product lines is intense the specialty chemicals business operates in a competitive environment influenced by capacity utilization customers ’ leverage and the impact of raw material and energy costs product introductions typically involve introductory educational costs in the year of launch and we usually are not able to determine whether new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of new products or the extension of the product lines our key competitors with respect to our spd segment are cargill incorporated lallemand inc solvay chemicals inc genesis alkali and natural soda inc for additional discussion of the competitive environment in which we conduct our business see item 1a risk factors

distribution of our products

seasonality

 

our business is generally not seasonal although the consumer domestic and consumer international segments are affected by sales of spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrushes and waterpik water flossers which typically are higher during the fall in advance of the holiday season sales of nair depilatories and waxes which typically are higher in the spring and summer months sales of vitafusion and l ’ il critters dietary supplements and zicam cold remedy products which typically are slightly higher in the fourth quarter of each year in advance of the cold and flu season and renewed commitments to health and sales of flawless which are typically higher in the second half of the year in spd several of our animal and food production products experience higher demand in warmer weather months creating higher seasonal demand in the second and third quarters of the year 

raw materials and sources of supply

we manufacture sodium bicarbonate for our consumer and specialty products businesses at our plants located at green river wyoming and old fort ohio the primary source of soda ash a basic raw material used in the production of sodium bicarbonate is the mineral trona which is found in abundance in southwestern wyoming near our green river plant we have adequate trona reserves under mineral leases to support our sodium bicarbonate requirements for the foreseeable future 

we are a party to a partnership agreement with tata chemicals soda ash partners which mines and processes trona reserves in wyoming we fulfill a substantial amount of our soda ash requirements through the partnership and related supply and services agreements enabling us to achieve some of the economies of an integrated business capable of producing sodium bicarbonate and related products from the basic raw material we also have an agreement for the supply of soda ash from another company the partnership agreement and other supply agreements between the tata chemicals soda ash partners and us are terminable upon two years notice by either of us we believe that sufficient alternative sources of soda ash supply are available

we believe that ample sources of raw materials are available for all our other major products detergent chemicals are used in a variety of our products and are available from a number of sources bottles paper products and clay are available from multiple suppliers although we choose to source most of these materials from single sources under longterm supply agreements in order to gain favorable economies of scale we also use certifiable sustainable palm oil derivatives in a number of products including primarily in our rumen bypass fats products alternative sources of supply are available in case of the disruption or termination of the supply agreements

 

the cost of raw materials including surfactants diesel fuel and oil  based raw and packaging materials used primarily in our consumer businesses were higher in 20 20 relative to 201 9  increasing our core commodity costs increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact our costs and financial results if we are unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to our customers 

we utilize the services of third party contract manufacturers around the world for certain products 

patents and trademarks

our trademarks appear in upper case letters throughout this annual report the majority of our trademarks are registered with either the us patent and trademark office or with the trademark offices of many foreign countries the arm  hammer trademark has been used by us since 1867 and is a valuable asset and important to the successful operation of our business our products are sold under many other valuable trademarks held by us including trojan nair orajel waterpik first response xtra oxiclean spinbrush batiste simply saline l ’ il critters vitafusion flawless and zicam our portfolio of trademarks represents substantial value in the businesses using the trademarks

us patents are currently granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed although we actively seek and maintain a number of patents no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole 

customers and order backlog 

in each of the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 net sales to our largest customer walmart inc and its affiliates  “ walmart ”  were 23 24 and 23 respectively of our consolidated net sales no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales in the threeyear period the time between receipt of orders and shipment is generally short and as a result backlog is not significant 

government regulation

general

some of our products are subject to regulation by one or more us agencies including the us food and drug administration  “ fda ”  the environmental protection agency  “ epa ”  the federal trade commission  “ ftc ”  the consumer product safety commission  “ cpsc ”  and foreign agencies 

fda regulations govern a variety of matters relating to our products such as product development manufacturing premarket clearance or approval labeling and distribution the regulations adopted and standards imposed by the fda and similar foreign agencies evolve over time and can require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes and quality systems to remain in compliance these agencies periodically inspect manufacturing and other facilities if we fail to comply with applicable regulations and standards we may be subject to sanctions including fines and penalties the recall of products and cessation of manufacturing andor distribution 

in addition we sell products that are subject to regulation under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and the toxic substances control act both of which are administered by the epa 

we are also subject to regulation by the ftc in connection with the content and truthfulness of our labeling advertising promotion trade practices and other matters the ftc has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of otherwise false or misleading advertising claims these enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties andor restitution by the companies involved such actions can result in substantial financial penalties and significantly restrict the marketing of our products

the cpsc has jurisdiction over consumer products regulates their safety and has authority over recalls the cpsc administers the poison prevention packaging act and has issued regulations requiring special child resistant packaging for certain products including pharmaceuticals dietary supplements and dietary substances containing certain ingredients eg iron

our relationship with certain union employees is regulated by various agencies of the countries states provinces and other localities in which we sell our products 

medical device clearance and approval 

to be commercially distributed in the us a medical device must unless exempt receive clearance or approval from the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act  “ fdca ”  for lower risk class ii devices we must generally submit a premarket notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution known as a “ 510k ” clearance our condoms lubricants contact lens solution wound wash home pregnancy test kits and waterpik professional dental products are regulated as class ii devices some other low risk devices including spinbrush and other battery powered toothbrushes and waterpik water flossers are in class i and are generally exempted 

 

from the 510k requirement to obtain 510k clearance a device must be determined to be substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a benchmark device or “ predicate ” that is already legally in commercial distribution any modification to a 510k cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a change in its intended use generally requires a new 510k clearance we may determine that a new 510k clearance is not required but if the fda disagrees it may retroactively require a 510k clearance and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified device until 510k clearance is obtained 

otc pharmaceutical

we market overthecounter “otc” pharmaceutical products such as toothpaste antiperspirant and oral analgesics products that are also subject to fda and foreign regulation under the us otc monograph system selected otc pharmaceutical products are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the submission and approval of a new drug application the fda otc monographs include wellknown ingredients and specify requirements for permitted indications required warnings and precautions allowable combinations of ingredients and dosage levels pharmaceutical products marketed under the otc monograph system must conform to specific quality formula and labeling requirements products not in the monograph system can be deemed to be unapproved new drugs and can be forced from the market this is particularly the case for homeopathic drug products like certain zicam products both the fda and the ftc have taken the position that homeopathic products are unapproved new drugs regulatory action against these products is deemed unlikely unless the products present an unreasonable safety risk zicam homeopathic products are not currently perceived to pose any such risk

all facilities where otc pharmaceutical products are manufactured tested packaged stored or distributed must comply with cgmp regulations andor regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries where the facilities are located all of our pharmaceutical products are manufactured tested packaged stored and distributed according to cgmp regulations the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that our facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representations made to customers or to regulatory action against us related to the products made in that facility such as seizure injunction or recall serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against us that among other things could result in the suspension of production or distribution of our products product seizures loss of certain licenses or other governmental penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results we are required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of our otc pharmaceutical products marketed in the us 

we cannot predict whether new legislation regulating our activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on our business

medical device and otc pharmaceutical postmarket regulation

after a medical device andor otc pharmaceutical is commercialized numerous regulatory requirements apply including 



food products

we market baking soda and animal feed products such as rumen fermentation enhancers and dietary cationanion difference  “ dcad ”  balancers that are also subject to fda and foreign regulation the food safety modernization act  “ fsma ”  regulates food and animal feed products and mandates preventive controls including hazard analysis risk controls supplier qualifications and controls and increased record keeping fsma grants the fda the authority to require mandatory recalls for products under certain conditions the fda is currently in the process of establishing rules and guidance to implement the provisions of fsma the potential impact of these rules and applicable guidance cannot be determined now

 

dietary supplements 

the processing formulation safety manufacturing packaging labeling advertising distribution importing selling and storing of dietary supplements are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies including the fda the ftc the cpsc the epa and by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold the fdca governs the composition safety labeling manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements 

it is unlawful to market as a dietary supplement any article that is approved as a new drug or is authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and made public unless that article was first marketed as a dietary supplement or food the fda has authority to effectively void that restriction through the issuance of a regulation finding the article lawful to date the fda has not exercised that rulemaking authority for any article

dietary ingredients that were not marketed in the us before october 15 1994 must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the fda at least 75 days before the initial marketing unless the ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for food without being chemically altered the notification must provide evidence of a history of use or other evidence establishing that use of the dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe the fda may determine that notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a new ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe which could effectively prevent the marketing of the ingredient in august of 2016 the fda issued draft guidance governing notification of new dietary ingredients although the draft guidance was issued for public comment and not for implementation it is a strong indication of the fda’s current thinking on the topics discussed in the guidance including the fda’s approach to enforcement if the fda enforces the applicable statutes and regulations in accord with the draft guidance that could effectively change the status of dietary ingredients that the industry has marketed as “ old ” dietary ingredients to “ new ” dietary ingredients and may require submission of a new dietary ingredient notification 

a company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess information substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading if the fda determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim or if the fda determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific evidence or is otherwise false or misleading the claim could not be used and any product bearing the claim could be subject to regulatory action

the fda ’ s cgmp regulations govern the manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers as with otc products the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that our dietary supplement facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representation made to consumers or to regulatory action against us related to the products made in that facility seizure injunction or recall there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the fda ’ s interpretation and implementation of the cgmp regulations the failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cgmp regulations may render products manufactured in that facility adulterated and subjects those products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential fda enforcement actions the manufacturer packer or distributor of a dietary supplement marketed in the us whose name appears on the label of the supplement is required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of that supplement to the fda 

additional legislation may be introduced which if passed would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements the effect of additional domestic or international governmental legislation regulations or administrative orders if and when promulgated cannot be determined new legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards and require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation

 i tem   1a risk factors 

the following risks and uncertainties as well as other factors described elsewhere in this annual report or in our other filings with the commission could individually and collectively have a material adverse impact on our business reputation financial results financial condition andor the trading price of our common stock 

business and operational risks



we face intense competition from consumer products companies both in the us and in international markets most of our products compete with other widelyadvertised promoted and merchandised brands within each product category and from retailers including supermarkets mass merchandisers wholesale clubs drugstores convenience stores home stores dollar and other discount stores pet and other specialty stores and websites and other ecommerce channels which are increasingly offering private label and retailerbranded brands and generic nonbranded products in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices  in china in particular we face strong competition from local manufacturers offering both generic and branded products the use of evolving technology to develop more complex pricing models by retailers may lead to pricing pressures in some categories in addition during times of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more “private label” or other lower price brands these developments have increased competition in certain product categories in particular including dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics in addition to competition across all our product categories there continues to be significant product competition in the gummy dietary supplement category which has grown from six brands to over 55 in the last nine years shifting consumer behavior including accelerated shifts to online shopping which has been accelerated by the covid19 pandemic have also increased competition in ecommerce in many of our categories from our larger legacy competitors and newer digitally native brands which have increasingly moved into consumer products and staples 

many of our competitors are large companies including among others the proctor  gamble company the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson nestle purina petcare company ansell limited alere inc pfizer inc bayer ag sc johnson  son inc pharmavite llc  koninklijke philips nv unilever plc and nbty inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and therefore have the capacity to outspend us on advertising and promotional activities and introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can 

our products generally compete on the basis of performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers significant price competition may require us to reduce the prices for some of our products or price levels that do not offset manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on retail customer decisions regarding the brands and product lines they sell and on consumer purchasing decisions a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if our advertising marketing and promotional programs are not effective our sales growth may decline  



a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our net sales andor net sales of specific product lines walmart is our largest customer accounting for approximately 23 of net sales in 2020 24 of net sales in 2019 and 23 of net sales in 2018 our top three customers accounted for approximately 36 of net sales each year in 2020 2019 and 2018 we expect that a significant portion of our net sales will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues as a result changes in the strategies of walmart or any of our other largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or of shelf space they dedicate to private label products could materially harm our net sales and profitability changes in consumer behavior including shifting to online shopping instead of physical retail shopping as a result of the covid19 pandemic and other trends could also impact our sales to our largest customers some of our retail customers have been forced to shut down or reduce their hours which has impacted and may continue to impact their orders some of our retail customers have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all if these impacts are prolonged they can further increase the difficulty of planning for operations moreover the use of evolving technology by our customers to develop more complex pricing models may lead to category pricing pressures we could also lose a significant customer due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues as our business is based primarily upon individual sales orders rather than longterm contracts and most customer agreements include customer termination rights after short notice many of our customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from us at any time and for any reason 



factors that can affect demand include competitors’ products advertising and pricing actions rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs including increased costs as a result of changes in federal regulations significant shifts in government policies 

 

the deterioration of economic or trade relations between countries or regions commodity costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior including gasoline and home heating oil pricing reduced unemployment benefits in periods of high unemployment  including the historically high unemployment rates resulting from the covid19 pandemic and changes in tax policies other effects of governmental shutdowns or a lapse of appropriations or fear of exposure to or actual impacts of a widespread disease outbreak such as covid19 in particular we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of laundry detergent and the continued customer demand for these products are critical to our future success some products have seen decreasing demand in recent years including condoms as a result of demographic and other changes   an increasing number of our products are more durable in nature and  therefore are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

changes resulting from the covid19 impact may also impact demand for our vitamin and supplement products the vitamins and supplements and cold remedy categories have seen increased demand as trends in health and wellness focus have accelerated however demand for these products has typically increased during winter months when consumers have increased rates of flu and cold infection and increased social distancing and flu vaccination rates may have a negative impact 



despite increasing shifts to ecommerce sales of our products remain strongest in the traditional mass merchandiser food and drug retail stores and our products are also sold in club stores and dollar stores channels however alternative retail channels including ecommerce retailers hard discounters subscription services and buying clubs have become more prevalent and the volume of consumer products that are sold through such alternative retail channels is continuing to increase which may affect customer and consumer preferences including in response to the covid19 pandemic and market dynamics including any pricing pressures for consumer goods as retailers face added costs to build their ecommerce capacity further consumer preferences continue to evolve due to a number of factors including fragmentation of the consumer market and changes in consumer demographics including the aging of the general population and the emergence of millennials and generation z who have different spending consumption and purchasing habits evolving consumer concerns or perceptions regarding esg and sustainability practices of manufacturers including packaging materials such as plastic packaging and their environmental impact a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients changing consumer sentiment toward nonlocal products or sources among millennials and other demographic groups evolving consumer concerns or perceptions whether accurate or inaccurate regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products and concerns regarding human capital including diversity and inclusion 

the movement of consumers to online purchases of consumer products has greatly accelerated as a result of the covid19 pandemic as store closures quarantine and gathering restrictions and social distancing efforts have reduced physical retail shopping we and many of our competitors have increased our online sales as a result benefiting from scale brand recognition and other factors however as consumers continue to shift their behavior retailers may incur higher ecommerce operating costs and will seek to recover those costs by passing them onto customers and manufacturers additionally we cannot predict the extent to which our increased ecommerce demand will continue as pandemic conditions change including as a result of vaccines or reduced rates of infection



larger and increasingly consolidated retailers have increasing influence and have sought to obtain lower pricing special packaging inventory practices logistics or other changes to the customersupplier relationship as a result of this influence to the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms to those customers our profit margins are reduced further if we are unable to effectively respond to the demands of our customers these customers could reduce their purchases of our products and increase their purchases of products from competitors  reductions in inventory by our customers including as a result of consolidation in the retail industry or these customers managing their working capital requirements could result in reduced orders for our products and adversely affect our results of operations for financial periods affected by such reductions 

protracted unfavorable market conditions including those caused by the covid19 pandemic have caused many of our customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell and reduce or discontinue certain of our product lines particularly those products that were not number one or two in their category 

in addition private label and retailbranded products sold by retail trade chains are typically sold at lower prices than branded products as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending our customers have discontinued or reduced distribution of some of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase the customers’ less expensive and in some cases more profitable private label and retailbranded products primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories 



we may continue to pursue and consummate additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future those acquisitions may be significantly larger than the ones completed in the past and may require us to increase our levels of debt potentially resulting in us being assigned a lower credit rating however we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisition at attractive valuations obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions in recent periods competition from other consumer products companies that are seeking similar opportunities has been 

 

particularly strong and valuations for potential acquisition assets have been high which has placed pressure on our ability to identify structure and execute transactions in addition acquisitions and investments entail various risks including the difficulty of entering new markets or product categories the challenges of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the ongoing business of the acquired company the need to review and if necessary upgrade processes and systems of the acquired company to conform to our own processes and systems and applicable legal and regulatory requirements managing an increasingly broad and complex range of businesses and products and generally our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment any of these risks may divert management and other resources require us to incur unanticipated costs or delay the anticipated positive impact on our business and results of the acquisition the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent we acquire businesses that have standalone operations or businesses that are in new categories that cannot easily be integrated or operations or sources of supply outside of the us and canada for which products are manufactured locally by third parties 

acquired companies or operations or newlycreated ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made in addition future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the potentially dilutive issuances of new equity by us or the incurrence of additional debt or business acquisition liabilities 



a significant percentage of our revenues come from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during 2020 approximately 83 of our sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes dietary supplements antiperspirants and deodorants our ability to quickly innovate to adapt our products to meet changing consumer demands is essential especially in light of ecommerce significantly reducing the barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers even if we are successful in increasing sales within our product categories a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for our products could have a negative impact on our financial results 

some of our personal care brands have been negatively impacted by the temporary closures of certain nonessential retailers and the reduction of consumer foot traffic at retailers from which they derive a significant proportion of their sales due to the covid19 pandemic flawless and some other personal care brands have also been impacted by reduced demand for discretionary consumable products by consumers due the impact of the covid19 pandemic including increased unemployment and concerns about the economy some product categories have seen decreasing demand in recent years including condoms as a result of demographic and other changes continuing recessionary economic conditions including after the direct impact of the pandemic has subsided may continue to impact consumer demand for certain of our products and put downward pressure on product prices



our future performance and growth depend on our ability to successfully identify develop and introduce new products product line extensions products in adjacent categories to our current products and anticipate changes in consumer preferences in addition some of our products have shorter product life spans and depend heavily on our ability to continuously and timely introduce innovative new products to the marketplace the successful development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development marketing and promotional expenditures which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which we have limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays competitor actions regulatory approval hurdles and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products could result in a concomitant decline in sales of existing products  

each year we introduce new products including launches into new “white space” categories across the majority of our marketed brands however there is no assurance that our new products will continue to have widespread acceptance from time to time we have discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs we may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet retailer or consumer expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand  



from time to time we initiate planned and unplanned expansion projects with respect to our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers which are subject to risks of and we have from time to time experienced delay or cost overruns resulting from numerous factors including the following shortages of equipment materials or skilled labor work stoppages unscheduled delays in 

 

the delivery of ordered materials and equipment unanticipated cost increases difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions difficulties in meeting regulatory or quality requirements or obtaining regulatory approvals availability of suppliers to certify equipment for existing and enhanced regulations design and engineering problems failure or delay of third party service providers  and civil unrest  labor disputes  natural disasters and pandemics  if we were to experience delays or cost overruns in the future it could result in product allocation and retailer frustration the loss of a significant customer or customers and the material decrease of the sales of one or more of our products  in addition we could miscalculate our anticipated capacity needs in any of our categories such as our laundry detergent cat litter and dietary supplement categories  including as a result of meeting the anticipated demand of our customers or expansion into new product lines or into new markets 

additionally the supply of our products depends on the uninterrupted efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers and our ability to meet customer service levels and the manufacturing of certain of our products is concentrated in one or more of our plants contract manufacturers or other suppliers with limited alternate qualified facilities available many of our manufacturing processes and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers are complex and present difficult technical challenges to obtain the manufacturing yields necessary to operate profitably and may require complex and specialized equipment which can be expensive to repair or replace with required lead times of up to a year

any event that disrupts or otherwise negatively impacts manufacturing facilities manufacturing systems or equipment or contract manufacturers or other suppliers could result in the delivery of inferior products or our ability to meet customer requirements or service levels as the covid19 pandemic continues we could face challenges and retailer penalties in continuing to operate our facilities and delivery of on time and in full product shipments as a result of employee absenteeism or sickness additional governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers



we rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain of our commodities and raw materials including sole source suppliers for certain of our raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers must be qualified pursuant to our standards and may also have to be qualified under governmental and industry standards and any other standards of our customers which can require additional investment and time we could experience material disruptions in production and other supply chain issues including as a result of our dependence on sole source and other suppliers which could result in outofstock conditions moreover our relationships with customers could be adversely affected if new or existing suppliers are unable to meet any standards set by us government or industry regulations or our customers if we are unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for our business if any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent ceases or significantly reduces its operations or experiences financial distress as a result of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise or if any environmental economic or other outside factors impact its operations we may be unable to qualify any needed new contract manufacturers or suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships based on a variety of factors we may be unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for our business certain of our suppliers may not meet the standards of our customers or licensors or certain of our key contract manufacturers or suppliers may become insolvent or experience other financial distress or face closure or suspension of operations if any of these events occurs and we have failed to identify and qualify an alternative vendor then we may be unable to meet our contractual obligations and customer expectations which could damage our reputation and result in lost customers and sales or the incurrence of fines or higher than expected expenses  further the covid19 pandemic has caused worldwide increases in demand for some products and reduced demand for other products which has caused strain on our supply chain network and its ability to meet such demand 



the principal raw materials and packaging used by us and certain of our suppliers and contract manufacturers include surfactants cleaning agents paper products and resinbased molded components volatility and increases in the price of raw materials disruptions in production or transportation or increases in the costs of energy shipping and other necessary services could significantly affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution there is no assurance that we will be able to fully offset any price increases through cost reduction programs or price increases of our products or enter lockedin price arrangements or hedge agreements especially given the competitive environment sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share while we seek to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume our projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases in addition volatility in certain commodity markets could significantly affect our production cost  

from time to time we use hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of commodities and diesel fuel prices the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to product costs enabling us to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in prices over the term of the contract however in periods of declining fuel or other commodity prices the hedge agreements can have the effect of locking us in at abovemarket prices  

 



we distribute our products and receive raw materials and packaging components primarily by truck rail and ship and through various ports of entry reduced availability of trucking rail or shipping capacity due to adverse weather conditions natural disasters including climatic events including any potential effect of climate change allocation of assets to other industries or geographies or otherwise work stoppages closure of operations due to government restrictions or sick employees or other impacts of pandemics strikes or shutdowns of ports of entry or such transportation sources could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials or packaging components in a timely manner which could disrupt our operations strain our customer relationships and competitive position 



our financial success is directly dependent on the reputation and success of our brands particularly the arm  hammer batiste first response nair orajel oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion spinbrush waterpik xtra flawless and zicam brands the effectiveness of these brands could suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers our brands could suffer damage to their reputations due to real or perceived sustainability quality or safety issues including as a result of among other things significant product recalls productrelated litigation defects or impurities in our products product misuse changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or allegations of product tampering in addition as our sales on various ecommerce platforms grow we may be unable to prevent sales of counterfeit pirated or stolen goods unlawful or unethical sales unauthorized resellers online or sales in violation of our policies 

additionally claims made in our marketing campaigns may become subject to litigation alleging false advertising and could cause us to alter our marketing plans and may affect sales or result in the imposition of significant damages against us 

 

widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility and speed of dissemination of negative information negative online consumer reviews or inaccurate posting or comments about us or our brands in the media or on any social networking website whether accurate or inaccurate or the disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information through social media could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands in addition given the association of our individual products with us an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products or us as a whole 



our ability to continue to grow our sales and profits is dependent on expanding in the locations in which we already do business and entering into new geographic locations both of which require significant resources and investments which would affect our risk profile further our international operations subject us to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 































the covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a negative impact on the global economy with reduced international travel restrictions and social distancing measures and recessionary conditions in many countries major developments in trade relations including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the us andor other countries and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could 

 

alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing all the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to commercialize our products on a competitive basis in international markets 

in addition changes as result of the united kingdom’s decision and subsequent negotiations to exit the eu could subject us to heightened risks in that region including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods services and people to and from the united kingdom increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and additional legal and economic uncertainty additional costs have been incurred in 2020 because of measures implemented to address or mitigate risks there is a risk that the exit will cause a material rise in the cost of doing business in the uk moreover in all foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions the recent imposition of tariffs on products imported from certain countries has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries major developments in trade relations including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the us andor other countries and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which in turn could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations all the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to commercialize our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 



the market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and brand names we own the material trademarks and brand names used in connection with the marketing and distribution of our major products both in the us and in other countries while we hold several valuable patents on our products they may not serve as an effective barrier to entry for new competitors accordingly we rely on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights although most of our material intellectual property is registered in the us and in certain foreign countries in which we operate we cannot be sure that our intellectual property rights will be sufficient or effectively utilized or if necessary successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future and we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties infringe our intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with our brands and harm our sales our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition if our products are found to infringe intellectual property rights of others the owners of those rights could bring legal actions against us claiming substantial damages for past infringement and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products if these legal actions are successful in addition to any potential liability for damages from past infringement we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products potentially adding significant costs we might not prevail in any action brought against us or we may be unsuccessful in securing any license for continued use and therefore have to discontinue the marketing and sale of a product 



we have a material amount of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets as well as other longlived tangible assets which are periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards declines in our profitability andor estimated cash flows related to specific intangible assets as well as potential changes in market valuations for similar assets and market discount rates has resulted in impairment charges from time to time and may result in future impairment charges  

 

regulatory and litigation risks

 



from time to time we are subject to product liability or other productrelated claims we may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by our products including losses or injuries caused by raw materials or other components provided by third party suppliers that are included in our products claims could be based on allegations that among other things our products contain contaminants are improperly tested labeled or designed or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings of potential dangers related to their use whether or not successful product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm 

 

our sales and operating results and the reputation of our brands in addition if one of our products is found to be defective or noncompliant with applicable rules or regulations we could be required to withdraw or recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability and product recall insurance coverage potential product liability or other productrelated damages claims and or withdrawal and recall costs may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy  



from time to time we are the subject of or party to various pending or threatened legal actions including class actions government investigations and proceedings including without limitation those relating to commercial transactions product liability consumer employment antitrust environmental health safety and compliancerelated matters such proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of certain pending or threatened legal actions investigations and proceedings may not be reasonably predictable and any related damages injunctions andor settlements may not be estimable   



we must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations 



as climate change land use water use deforestation recyclability or recoverability of packaging plastic waste ingredients and other esg and sustainability concerns become more prevalent federal state and local governments nongovernmental organizations and our customers consumers and investors are increasingly sensitive to these issues this increased focus on sustainability may result in new laws regulations and requirements that could cause disruptions in or increased costs associated with manufacturing our products this could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with any of the foregoing we could also lose revenue if our consumers change brands or our customers move business from us because we have not complied with their esg and sustainability requirements and environmentallyconscious investors may choose not to invest in our common stock if we do not comply with their business expectations 

we have recognized that our customers and consumers are increasingly demanding transparency regarding our efforts to mitigate our impacts on climate change for example during 2020 some of our major customers requested we respond to various questionnaires including the climate disclosure project “cdp” climate change and forests questionnaires and use our responses and cdp grades to evaluate us efforts to meet these standards could impact our costs and failure to meet our customers’ expectations could impact our sales

certain of our business activities and the production of some of the materials used in our products and certain of our business activities including petroleum based agricultural and forest materials and the growing global demand for livestock products which is a focus of our animal and food production business contribute to deforestation and climate change and reduction in biodiversity and can adversely impact water quality and availability people and communities climate change is in turn a threat to each of those activities while we strive to minimize the environmental impact of our global operations a potential loss in business could result from reduced demand for our products and loss of customers if we do not meet their expectations related to our efforts towards sustainability and fighting climate change



the development manufacturing processing formulation including stability packaging labeling marketing distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the ftc the epa and the cpsc and foreign regulators and agencies in addition our and our suppliers’ operations are subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which our products and their constituent materials and components are manufactured and sold  

in particular the fda and foreign counterparts regulate the formulation safety development manufacturing packaging labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits vaginal lubricants electric and battery powered medical devices overthecounter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements including vitamins minerals and homeopathic products the fda also exercises oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of our other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that we and our suppliers use to manufacture regulated products and may identify compliance issues 

 

that would require us and our suppliers to make certain changes in our manufacturing facilities and processes the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to regulatory action against the products made in that facility including seizure injunction or recall as well as to possible action against the owner of the facilitymanufacturer we may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until the compliance issue has been remediated 

likewise any future determination by the fda or a similar foreign agency or by us in reviewing our compliance with applicable rules and regulations that our products or quality systems do not comply with applicable regulations could result in future compliance activities including product withdrawals or recalls import detentions injunctions preventing the shipment of products or other enforcement actions for example the fda may determine that a particular claim that we use to support the marketing of a product is not substantiated may not accept the evidence of safety for a new product that we may wish to market may challenge the safety or effectiveness of existing products based on among other things changes in formulations inadequate stability or “shelflife” consumer complaints or improper labeling and may determine that our dietary supplement business manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations do not comply with cgmps similarly we may identify these or other issues in internal compliance reviews of our operations and the operations and products of vendors and acquired companies these other issues may include the identification of contaminants or noncompliant levels of particular ingredients any of the foregoing could subject us to adverse publicity force us to incur unanticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  additionally delays in the acceptance review and approval of products by the fda or other required governmental approvals may result from government shutdowns due to the failure by congress to enact regular appropriations 

in 2019 our vitafusion brand launched cbd full spectrum hemp extract gummies a new product line made with full spectrum hemp extract containing cannabidiol “cbd” hemp was exempted from federal regulation as a controlled substance under the agriculture improvement act of 2018 the “2018 farm bill” the 2018 farm bill did not eliminate or affect regulation of hemp and its derivatives by the fda ftc or state governments we believe that our new product line complies with applicable fda requirements although the fda takes the position that cbd products cannot be marketed as dietary supplements and that cbd cannot be added to food to date the fda’s enforcement activity has focused primarily on cbd products that bear express or implied claims suggesting that the products are intended to treat cure prevent or mitigate a disease the ftc has similarly focused on disease claims our products do not bear disease claims

the fda is considering whether to engage in rulemaking to permit the marketing of cbd products as dietary supplements there has also been discussion of legislative changes for example hr 5587 was introduced in january 2020 hr5587 would amend the fdc act to include hempderived cbd in the definition of a dietary supplement although state laws have been evolving in the wake of the 2018 farm bill we do not intend to sell our products in states that continue to prohibit sales of certain hempbased cbd products in 2021 our nair brand is launching one depilatory cosmetic product that contains broad spectrum hemp extract fda’s position that cbd products cannot be marketed as dietary supplements and that cbd cannot be added to food does not extend to cosmetic products we do not intend to sell our nair product in states that continue to prohibit sales of certain hempbased cbd products the fda and certain states and local governments may enact regulations or change their enforcement priorities in a manner that further limits the marketing and use of cbd products we do not know what the impact of such regulatory activities would be on our products and what costs requirements and possible prohibitions may be associated with such regulatory activities our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or fda’s or any other state’s disagreeing with our interpretation of applicable fda or state requirements could result in among other things administrative civil or criminal penalties or fines product seizure mandatory or voluntary product recalls warning or untitled letters cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance closure of facilities or operations the loss revocation or modification of any existing licenses permits registrations or approvals or the failure to obtain additional licenses permits registrations or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business these laws and regulations may change in the future and we may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current or future laws and regulations or in any product recalls 

we are subject to regulations regarding the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment as well as the commission’s rules with respect to “conflict minerals” the new administration and congress in the united states may seek to pass more stringent regulations in these areas or more aggressively enforce existing regulations recent trade policies tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries have introduced greater uncertainty and volatility in addition any additional or renewed significant governmental actions pertaining to the covid19 pandemic including lockdowns quarantines or other restrictions on the ability of our employees to travel or perform necessary business functions or our ability to develop manufacture distribute market or sell our products or the ability of our suppliers customers or thirdparty partners to effectively run their operations may negatively impact our ability to manufacture distribute market and sell our products we are not able to predict the nature of these changes or of such future laws regulations repeals or interpretations or to predict the effect additional or shifting governmental regulation when and if it occurs would have on our business in the future such developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated additional recordkeeping requirements increased documentation of the properties of certain products additional or different labeling additional scientific substantiation expanded adverse event reporting or other new requirements 

there is also an increased risk of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls additionally we could be subject to future inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies which may be delayed or disrupted due to any government furlough we could also be adversely affected by violations or allegations of violations of the foreign corrupt practices act and similar international antibribery laws the foreign corrupt practices act and similar international 

 

antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 



 

we collect use and store personal data of our employees customers and other third parties in the ordinary course of business and we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy and security laws and regulations that apply to the collection storage use transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer and employee data including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries recent highprofile security breaches of the information systems of a number of government agencies and us companies may result in increased regulations and new security laws the new administration and congress in the united states may seek to pass more stringent regulations in these areas or more aggressively enforce existing regulations

 

numerous local municipal state federal and international law and regulations address privacy and security including the california online privacy protection act the personal information protection and electronic documents act the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing canspam act the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa section 5c of the federal trade commission act and effective as of january 1 2020 the california consumer privacy act ccpa these privacy and security laws and regulations change frequently and new legislation continues to be introduced in particular the ccpa requires new disclosures to california consumers  gives california consumers new rights with respect to their data and permits california consumers to optout of certain sales of personal information the ccpa provides for fines of up to 7500 per violation

 

in europe the european union eu has adopted strict data privacy regulations following the passage of the eu’s general data protection regulation eu 2016679 “gdpr” and the regulation on privacy and electronic communications the “eprivacy regulation” data privacy and security compliance in the eu are increasingly complex and challenging the gdpr in particular has broad extraterritorial effect and imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with significant penalties for noncompliance up to 4 of worldwide annual turnover or €20 million whichever is higher it is also important to note that many countries are following the eu in producing a broad omnibus law in relation to privacy protection for instance brazil has just published a gdprlike law in general the gdpr and eprivacy regulation ccpa and other local privacy laws could also require adaptation of our technologies or practices increased costs and changes to operations to satisfy local privacy requirements and standards 

 

we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines penalties or orders to cease delay or modify collection use or transfers of personal data we could also face rights requests complaints claims or litigation from those persons whose data we collect use and store as well as government investigations and fines any of these events or other circumstances related to our collection use and transfer of personal data could also lead to negative media attention damage to our reputation in the market or otherwise adversely affect our business



our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in addition we evaluate our deferred income tax assets and record a valuation allowance if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized if the actual amount of our future taxable income is less than the amount we are currently projecting with respect to specific tax jurisdictions or if there is a change in the time period within which the deferred tax asset becomes deductible we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets the recording of a valuation allowance would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on our operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances which would also impact our effective tax rate the new presidential administration has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax policies in the united states and major developments in tax policy could impact our business



 

significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we provide for uncertain tax positions with respect to tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards mandated by applicable accounting guidance fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results we are regularly under audit by tax authorities and although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

 



our amended and restated bylaws include an “exclusive forum provision” which may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers if a court outside of delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

 

financial risks



as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 2164 million of total consolidated indebtedness net of debt issuance costs this amount of indebtedness could have important consequences including













additionally our credit facility is subject to certain financial and other customary covenants  in the event of a breach of those covenants our lenders under the credit facility may be entitled to accelerate the related debt and any lenders in respect of any other debt to which a crossdefault provision applies may be entitled to accelerate such other debt and we could be required to seek amendments or waivers under the debt instruments or to refinance the debt we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes if additional new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify a substantial increase in our indebtedness could also have a negative impact on our credit ratings  in this regard failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate available to us in future financings as well as our liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets any decision regarding future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time including market conditions and our credit ratings  

libor the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt including our revolving credit facility term loan and interest rate swaps was expected to be fully phased out by the end of 2021 when privatesector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate however in late 2020 ice benchmark administration “iba” the organization responsible for administering libor announced its intention to extend the publication of certain usd libor tenors until june 30 2023 while it appears that some measure of phase out will still occur by the end of 2021 iba’s announcement creates uncertainty with respect to timing and implementation of a new reference rate given the inherent differences between libor and sofr or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established there are additional uncertainties regarding a transition from libor including but not limited to the need to amend all contracts with libor as the reference rate and how this will impact our cost of variable rate debt and certain derivative financial instruments we will also need to consider new contracts and if they should reference an alternative benchmark rate or include suggested fallback language as published by the alternative reference rates committee from time to time



we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk both transaction and translation with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar outside of the us sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the canadian dollar euro pound mexican peso and australian dollar among others a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we purchase materials and services in foreign markets although we from time to time enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed sales or purchases denominated in the us dollar canadian dollar pound euro mexican peso and 

 

australian dollar foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general risks



our business and financial results have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of the covid19 pandemic such as but not limited to

 





















despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as thirdparty or governmental actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects while the vast majority of our products are consumer staples that generally are less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products some of our products particularly waterpik and some other personal care brands are more discretionary in nature and are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending and the impact and duration of recessionary economic conditions

in early 2021 vaccines for combatting covid19 were approved by health agencies in certain countriesregions in which we operate including the us united kingdom european union canada and mexico and began to be administered however initial quantities of vaccines are limited and vaccine distributions controlled by local authorities are being allocated generally first to frontline health care workers and other essential workers and next to those members of individual populations believed most susceptible to severe effects from covid19 full administration of the covid19 vaccines is unlikely to occur in most jurisdictions until mid to late 2021 the impact of covid19 including the impact of restrictions imposed to combat its spread could result in additional businesses being shut down additional work restrictions and supply chains being interrupted slowed or rendered inoperable as a result it may be even more challenging to obtain and process raw materials to support our business needs and more individuals could become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work andor travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions also governments may impose other laws regulations or taxes which could adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations further as some of our customers’ businesses are similarly affected they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of our business financial condition or results of operations the potential effects of covid19 also could impact many of the other risk factors described herein but given the evolving health economic social and governmental environments such potential impact remains uncertain while we expect the impacts of covid19 to continue to have an effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time

 

 



our operations as well as the operations of our thirdparty manufacturers suppliers and customers may be subject to disruption from a variety of causes including a protracted economic downturn material shortages financial difficulties work stoppages cyberattacks and other disruptions in information technology systems demonstrations political instability or uncertainty in the us or abroad disease outbreaks or pandemics for example an outbreak of a virus such as covid19 acts of war terrorism fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters disruptions in logistics loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites supplier capacity constraints raw material and product quality or safety issues industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations 

 

the global economy and the economies in regions in which we conduct business have experienced substantial economic downturns as a result of the covid19 pandemic we are currently experiencing reduced demand for certain of our consumer products and may in the future be adversely affected in a material way by lower consumer demand as a result of recessionary economic conditions including after the direct impact of the covid19 pandemic has subsided in addition ongoing political uncertainty in many countries including the ongoing political transition in hong kong the exit of the united kingdom from the european union and the transition of presidential administrations in the united states have created additional economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets



we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to conduct our business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to internal communications and communications with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers billing customers and receiving and applying payment processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements collecting and storing customer consumer employee investor and other stakeholder information and personal data and other processes necessary to manage our business we sell certain of our products directly to consumers online and through websites mobile apps and connected devices and we offer promotions rebates customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and we or our vendors could experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that may result in unauthorized access disclosure and misuse of consumer customer employee vendor or company information 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including ransomware denial of service and phishing attacks and advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems networks and services and those of our customers and other business partners as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and the data of our customers and other business partners as a result our information technology systems networks or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or we could suffer a loss or disclosure of business personal or stakeholder information due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages and security breaches although we have business continuity plans in place and have implemented a breach response plan to address service interruptions if these plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct our operations which may adversely affect our business in addition if our service providers suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations recently there have been high profile security breaches of the information systems of a number of government agencies and us companies resulting in significant disruptions

our information technology systems and our thirdparty providers’ systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing social engineering hacking and other cyberattacks such attacks may originate from nation states or attempts by outside parties hackers criminal organizations or other threat actors in addition insider actorsmalicious or otherwisecould cause technical disruptions andor confidential data leakage to date we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks however we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers’ databases or systems in addition although we have policies and procedures in place governing the secure storage of personal information collected by us or our thirdparty service providers data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct may occur in the future 

 

although we are currently implementing enterprisewide upgrades to our systems and will continue to monitor and upgrade systems as appropriate legacy systems may be vulnerable to increased risk additionally if a new system does not function properly it could affect our ability to order supplies process and deliver customer orders and process and receive payments for our products this could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows moreover because the techniques tools and tactics used in cyberattacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack as such we may need to expend additional resources and incur additional costs in the future to continue to protect against or address problems caused by any business interruptions or data security breaches

 



the labor market in the united states is very competitive our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel including at our plants competition for qualified plant personnel has been intense the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees including as a result of illness to themselves or their families due to the covid19 pandemic or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations this effect could be exacerbated if any officers or other key personnel left as a group or at the same time our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified and diverse personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future  factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of key employees include employee morale our reputation competition from other employers and the availability of qualified personnel in a tightening labor market 



our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected our continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets such as our acquisition of waterpik flawless passport zicam and others may place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting and require us to update our internal control over financial reporting to integrate such acquisitions moreover we engage the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes which injects additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control when we are required to comply with new or revised accounting standards we must make any appropriate changes to our internal control over financial reporting to fully implement the standards which may require significant effort and judgment any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our results of operations accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to regulatory enforcement action and stockholder claims



in recent years proxy contests unsolicited takeovers and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous companies in our industry including us if such a campaign or proposal were to be made against us we would likely incur significant costs stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance strategic direction and operations of our business through stockholder proposals or otherwise disrupting our business and diverting the attention of our management and employees and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities the perception that we need a change in the direction of our business or the perception that we are unstable or lack continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to our current or potential customers and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business we may also be the target of short sellers who engage in negative publicity campaigns that may use selective information that may be presented out of context or that may misrepresent facts and circumstances during 2019 we were the target of a negative publicity campaign by a shortseller which negatively impacted our stock price

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 

overview

our business

we develop manufacture and market a broad range of consumer household and personal care and specialty products focused on animal and food production chemicals and cleaners we focus our consumer products marketing efforts principally on our 13 “power brands” these wellrecognized brand names include arm  hammer used in multiple product categories such as baking soda cat litter carpet deodorization and laundry detergent trojan condoms lubricants and vibrators oxiclean stain removers cleaning solutions laundry detergent and bleach alternatives spinbrush batteryoperated and manual toothbrushes first response home pregnancy and ovulation test kits nair depilatories orajel oral analgesic xtra laundry detergent l’il critters and vitafusion gummy dietary supplements batiste dry shampoos waterpik water flossers and replacement showerheads flawless products and zicam cold remedy products 

we sell our consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets mass merchandisers wholesale clubs drugstores convenience stores home stores dollar pet and other specialty stores and websites and other ecommerce channels all of which sell the products to consumers we sell our specialty products to industrial customers livestock producers and through distributors

we operate our business in three segments consumer domestic consumer international and the specialty products division “spd” the segments are based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures in 2020 the consumer domestic consumer international and spd segments represented approximately 77 17 and 6 respectively of our consolidated net sales

 

covid19 pandemic 

 

the covid19 pandemic is positively impacting certain of our businesses while negatively impacting the shortterm results of certain others we have continued to experience a significant increase in consumer demand for many of our products that began in march of 2020 including vitafusion and l’il critters gummy vitamins ah liquid laundry detergent  ah baking soda ah cat litter and kaboom bathroom cleaners on the other hand some other personal care brands have been negatively impacted by the temporary closures of certain nonessential retailers and the reduction of consumer foot traffic at retailers from which these brands derive a significant proportion of sales our waterpik business had been negatively impacted by the temporary closure of dental offices across the united states in the first half of the year but had positive sales growth in the second half and full year as dental offices have reopened looking forward we may experience significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products which may be caused by among other things the temporary or prolonged inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other travel or gathering restrictions store closures unemployment or other financial hardship shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products or stockpiling or similar pantryloading or unloading activity 

 

some products have also been impacted by a shift in consumer spending away from more discretionary products while there is no certainty that current high levels of demand for certain of our products will continue we have taken steps to increase shortterm manufacturing capacity for our cleaning products including laundry detergent baking soda and cleaners and health care products including vitamins and nasal hygiene and are working closely with our suppliers contract manufacturers and retail partners to ensure sustained supply to keep pace with increased demand we will also make investments in the expansion of longterm inhouse and thirdparty manufacturing capacity although we have seen increased demand in certain of our product categories in the future the covid19 pandemic may cause reduced demand for our products if it results in a recessionary global economic environment the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking in markets in which we serve may also have a negative impact on demand moreover we continue to experience and anticipate increased online sales during the covid19 pandemic

 

the covid19 pandemic and the corresponding government response have led to increased unemployment and economic uncertainty which could lead to a further reduction in consumer spending in early 2021 vaccines for combatting covid19 were approved by health agencies in some countries in which we operate including the us uk european union canada and mexico however initial quantities of vaccines are limited and vaccine distributions controlled by local authorities are being allocated generally first to frontline health care workers and other essential workers and next to those members of individual populations believed most susceptible to severe effects from covid19 full administration of the covid19 vaccines is unlikely to occur in most jurisdictions until mid to late 2021 economic conditions are and we expect that they will continue to be highly volatile and uncertain recessionary conditions could reduce demand for our discretionary products and put downward pressure on prices some of our retail customers have closed their stores or reduced store 

church  dwight co inc and subsidiaries

dollars in millions except share and per share data

 

hours which has impacted their ability to meet outstanding obligations and may cause further reductions in their purchases in the coming months 

 

substantially all of our products are considered by various governmental authorities to be essential for purposes of continuing our operations during the covid19 pandemic and our manufacturing and distribution facilities and those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers are open and continue to operate under applicable governmental requirements and guidance including the department of homeland security’s march 19 2020 guidance on the essential critical infrastructure workforce we intend to continue to work with government authorities implement our employee safety measures and supplement our inhouse manufacturing with increased use of contract manufacturers to ensure that we are able to continue to manufacture and distribute our products during the covid19 pandemic however uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain for example a closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key supplier contract manufacturer or transportation supplier to source and transport materials that could impact our operations and ability to supply products to our customers 

 

we are monitoring the impact that the covid19 pandemic and corresponding government action is having on our customers and consumer demand and how potentially it will impact future cash flows for the short and long term and its impact to intangible asset carrying values while we expect that many of these effects will not be permanent it is impossible to predict their duration 

2020 financial highlights 

key 2020 financial results include













strategic goals challenges and initiatives

our ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for our products and retail customers’ decisions to carry our products which are in part affected by general economic conditions in our markets while a vast majority of our products are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products an increasing number of our products particularly those from our recent acquisitions are more durable in nature and are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories launching their own brands and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category in addition an increasing portion of our product categories is being sold by club stores dollar stores mass merchandisers and internetbased retailers these factors have placed downward pressure on our sales and gross margins

we expect a competitive marketplace in 2021 due to new product introductions by competitors in this environment we intend to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives maintain competitive marketing and trade spending tightly control our cost structure continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursue strategic acquisitions we also intend to continue to grow our product sales globally and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products to appeal to a wide range of consumers

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of liquid laundry detergent the continued customer demand for these products are critical to our future success as a result any commercialization delays or reduction of sales of these products in the event that our diversification efforts discussed below are not successful could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and cash flows  in addition condom usage has declined  as a result of a lower 18 to 24 year  old population alternate birth control options less fear of hiv social distancing decreased sexual activity and increased competition all of which have contributed to lower demand for our product s in the condom category  we continue to evaluate and vigorously address these pressures through among other things new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending  h owever  there is no assurance that the categor y will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline 

we are continuously focused on strengthening our key brands through the launch of innovative new products which span various product categories including premium and value household products supported by increased marketing and trade spending there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 

in the domestic business seven out of 13 “power brands” met or exceeded category growth for the full year 2020 our global product portfolio consists of both premium 58 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2020 and value 42 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2020 brands which we believe enables us to succeed in a range of economic environments we intend to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among costconscious consumers 

over the past two decades we have diversified from an almost exclusively us business to a global company with approximately 17 of sales derived from international countries in 2020 we have subsidiary operations in six countries canada mexico uk france germany and australia and sell to over 130 other countries in 2020 we benefited from our expanded global footprint and expect to continue to focus on selectively expanding our global business if we are unable to expand our business internationally at the rate that we expect we may not realize the operational benefits that we anticipate 

although we believe ongoing international expansion represents a significant opportunity to grow our business our increasing activity in global markets exposes us to additional complexity and uncertainty net sales generated outside of the us are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as political uncertainty which could impact future operating results moreover the current domestic and international political environment including existing and potential changes to us policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty regarding the global economy the impact of us tariffs on certain products was a component of increased cost of sale during the year ended december 31 2020 the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we manufacture or sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition

we also continue to focus on controlling our costs historically we have been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent by passing along some of these cost increases to customers we have also entered into set pricing and prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel and other commodities should we be required to address cost increases by increasing the prices that our customers pay for our products we cannot be certain they will be accepted additionally maintaining tight controls on overhead costs has been a hallmark of ours and has enabled us to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions 

the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of our overall strategy and product category diversification acquisitions have added significantly to our sales and profits and product category diversification over the last decade this is evidenced by our 2015 acquisition of certain assets of varied industries corporation the “vicor acquisition” 2016 acquisitions of spencer forrest inc the maker of toppik the “toppik acquisition” and the anusol and rectinol businesses from johnson  johnson the “anusol acquisition” 2017 acquisitions of viviscal from lifes2good holdings limited the “viviscal acquisition” agro biosciences inc the “agro acquisition” and waterpik from pik holdings inc the “waterpik acquisition” 2018 acquisition of passport food safety solutions inc the “passport acquisition” the 2019 acquisition of flawless and the 2020 acquisition of zicam from consumer health holdco llc however the failure to effectively identify or integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause us to incur material asset writedowns we actively seek acquisitions that fit our guidelines and our strong financial position provides us with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in addition our ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled us to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions since 2001 we have acquired 12 of our 13 “power brands” 

we believe we are positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to our strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives maintaining competitive marketing and trade spending managing our cost structure continuing to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursuing strategic acquisitions this focus together with the strength of our portfolio of premium and value brands has enabled us to succeed in a range of economic environments  and is expected to position us to continue to increase stockholder value over the longterm moreover the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations as a result of net income and effective working capital management combined with an investment grade credit rating provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions drive new product development make capital

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty they are based on our historical experience our observation of trends in industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate our significant accounting policies and estimates are described below 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves

virtually all of our revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by our customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for our products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements and coupons are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold we rely on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example we use historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements a difference of approximately 10 in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns we use experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if our estimates for promotional activities and sales returns reserves were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 96 while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations 

impairment of goodwill trade names and other intangible assets 

carrying values of goodwill and indefinitelived trade names are reviewed periodically for possible impairment  finite intangible assets are assessed when there are business triggering events our impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trade names and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired the result of our annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units in addition there were no goodwill impairment charges for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2020

 

fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” or “excess earnings” discounted cash flow method which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change and therefore could impact fair values in the future we determined that the fair value of all intangible assets for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2020 exceeded their respective carrying values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability however in recent years our trojan business specifically the condom category has not grown and competition has increased resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flows as a result the trojan business has experienced sales and profit declines that has eroded a significant portion of the excess between the fair and carrying value of the tradename which could potentially result in an impairment while management can and has implemented strategies to address the risk significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of these assets 

it is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if for example i the businesses or brands do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized we record liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under us gaap guidelines the liabilities relate to tax return positions that although supportable by us may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement we adjust this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change in this regard settlement of any issue or an adverse determination in litigation with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate conversely favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate

in november of 2017 we executed open market purchases of 1000 of our common stock under the 2017 share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2018 we settled an accelerated share repurchase “asr” contract and purchased approximately 41 million shares of common stock for 2000 of which approximately 1100 was purchased under the evergreen share repurchase program and 900 was purchased under the 2017 share repurchase program 

in january 2019 we executed open market purchases of 1000 of our common stock all of which were purchased under the evergreen share repurchase program in september 2019 we executed open market purchases of 1500 of our common stock of which 500 was purchased under the evergreen share repurchase program and 1000 was purchased under the 2017 share repurchase program

as a result of these common stock repurchases there remains 2100 of share repurchase availability under the 2017 share repurchase program as of december 31 2020

we anticipate that our cash from operations together with our current borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our share repurchase programs to the extent implemented by management pay debt and interest as it comes due and pay dividends at the latest approved rate and meet our capital expenditure program costs which are expected to be approximately 180 in 2021 primarily for manufacturing capacity investments in laundry litter and vitamins to support expected future sales growth we do not have any mandatory fixed rate debt principal payments due in 2021 cash together with our current borrowing capacity may be used for acquisitions that would complement our existing product lines or geographic markets

cash flow analysis

competition

we compete in the household and personal care consumer product categories which are highly innovative categories characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and require significant advertising and promotion we compete in these categories primarily on the basis of product innovation and performance brand recognition price value and other consumer benefits consumer products particularly laundry and dietary supplements are subject to significant price competition as a result we from time to time may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share product introductions typically involve heavy marketing and trade spending in the year of launch and we usually are not able to determine whether the new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product line

because of the competitive retail environment we face pricing pressure from our retail customers and customers selling through other channels particularly highvolume retail customers including internetbased retailers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms that could reduce our margins furthermore if we are unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to our customers they could increase product purchases from competitors and reduce purchases from us which would harm our sales and profitability

our competitors in the consumer domestic and consumer international segments include procter  gamble company “pg” the clorox company colgatepalmolive company sc johnson  son inc nestle purina petcare company henkel reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson ansell limited pfizer inc bayer ag alere inc nbty inc koninklijke philips nv unilever plc and pharmavite llc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and have the capacity to outspend us in their attempts to gain market share in addition the growing number of sales channels and business models such as niche brands internetonly brands and discounter channels have increased competition in certain product categories such as oral care from less well capitalized competitors

competition within our animal and food production and our specialty chemicals product lines is intense the specialty chemicals business operates in a competitive environment influenced by capacity utilization customers ’ leverage and the impact of raw material and energy costs product introductions typically involve introductory educational costs in the year of launch and we usually are not able to determine whether new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of new products or the extension of the product lines our key competitors with respect to our spd segment are cargill incorporated lallemand inc solvay chemicals inc genesis alkali and natural soda inc for additional discussion of the competitive environment in which we conduct our business see item 1a risk factors

our products in this segment are stored in our plants and public warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking companies or picked up by customers at our facilities 

seasonality

 

our business is generally not seasonal although the consumer domestic and consumer international segments are affected by sales of spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrushes and waterpik water flossers which typically are higher during the fall in advance of the holiday season sales of nair depilatories and waxes which typically are higher in the spring and summer months sales of vitafusion and l ’ il critters dietary supplements which typically are slightly higher in the fourth quarter of each year in advance of the cold and flu season and renewed commitments to health and sales of flawless which are typically higher in the second half of the year in spd several of our animal and food production products experience higher demand in warmer weather months creating higher seasonal demand in the second and third quarters of the year 

raw materials and sources of supply

we manufacture sodium bicarbonate for our consumer and specialty products businesses at our plants located at green river wyoming and old fort ohio the primary source of soda ash a basic raw material used in the production of sodium bicarbonate is the mineral trona which is found in abundance in southwestern wyoming near our green river plant we have adequate trona reserves under mineral leases to support our sodium bicarbonate requirements for the foreseeable future 

we are a party to a partnership agreement with tata chemicals soda ash partners which mines and processes trona reserves in wyoming we fulfill a substantial amount of our soda ash requirements through the partnership and related supply and services agreements enabling us to achieve some of the economies of an integrated business capable of producing sodium bicarbonate and related products from the basic raw material we also have an agreement for the supply of soda ash from another company the partnership agreement and other supply agreements between the tata chemicals soda ash partners and us are terminable upon two years notice by either of us we believe that sufficient alternative sources of soda ash supply are available

we believe that ample sources of raw materials are available for all our other major products detergent chemicals are used in a variety of our products and are available from a number of sources bottles paper products and clay are available from multiple suppliers although we choose to source most of these materials from single sources under longterm supply agreements in order to gain favorable economies of scale we also use certifiable sustainable palm oil derivatives in a number of products including primarily in our rumen bypass fats products alternative sources of supply are available in case of the disruption or termination of the supply agreements

the cost of raw materials including surfactants diesel fuel and oilbased raw and packaging materials used primarily in our consumer businesses were higher in 2019 relative to 2018 increasing our core commodity costs increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact our costs and financial results if we are unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to our customers

patents and trademarks

us patents are currently granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed although we actively seek and maintain a number of patents no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole 

customers and order backlog 

in each of the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 net sales to our largest customer walmart inc and its affiliates  “ walmart ”  were 24 23 and 24 respectively of our consolidated net sales no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales in the threeyear period the time between receipt of orders and shipment is generally short and as a result backlog is not significant

dietary ingredients that were not marketed in the us before october 15 1994 must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the fda at least 75 days before the initial marketing unless the ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for food without being chemically altered the notification must provide evidence of a history of use or other evidence establishing that use of the dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe the fda may determine that notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a new ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe which could effectively prevent the marketing of the ingredient in august of 2016 the fda issued draft guidance governing notification of new dietary ingredients although the draft guidance was issued for public comment and not for implementation it is a strong indication of the fda’s current thinking on the topics discussed in the guidance including the fda’s approach to enforcement if the fda enforces the applicable statutes and regulations in accord with the draft guidance that could effectively change the status of dietary ingredients that the industry has marketed as “ old ” dietary ingredients to “ new ” dietary ingredients and may require submission of a new dietary ingredient notification 

a company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess information substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading if the fda determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim or if the fda determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific evidence or is otherwise false or misleading the claim could not be used and any product bearing the claim could be subject to regulatory action

the fda ’ s cgmp regulations govern the manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers as with otc products the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that our dietary supplement facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representation made to consumers or to 

 

regulatory action against us related to the products made in that facility seizure injunction or recall there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the fda ’ s interpretation and implementation of the cgmp regulations the failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cgmp regulations may render products manufactured in that facility adulterated and subjects those products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential fda enforcement actions the manufacturer packer or distributor of a dietary supplement marketed in the us whose name appears on the label of the supplement is required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of that supplement to the fda 

additional legislation may be introduced which if passed would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements the effect of additional domestic or international governmental legislation regulations or administrative orders if and when promulgated cannot be determined new legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards and require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations relating to environmental concerns including air emissions wastewater discharges solid and hazardous waste management activities and the safety of our employees we endeavor to take actions necessary to comply with such regulations these steps include periodic environmental and health and safety audits of our facilities the audits conducted by independent firms with expertise in environmental health and safety compliance include site visits at each location as well as a review of documentary information to determine compliance with such federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations 

employees 

at december 31 2019 we had approximately 4800 employees internationally we employ union employees in france mexico and new zealand we believe our relations with both our union and nonunion employees are satisfactory

 i tem   1a risk factors 

the following risks and uncertainties as well as other factors described elsewhere in this annual report or in our other filings with the commission could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 



we face intense competition from consumer products companies both in the us and in international markets most of our products compete with other widelyadvertised promoted and merchandised brands within each product category and from retailers including supermarkets mass merchandisers wholesale clubs drugstores convenience stores home stores dollar and other discount stores pet and other specialty stores and websites and other ecommerce channels which are increasingly offering private label and retailerbranded brands and generic nonbranded products of our customers in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices  in china for example we expect to face strong competition from certain local manufacturers offering generic products 

our products generally compete on the basis of performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers consumer products are subject to significant price competition as a result we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase prices by an amount that does not cover manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices or inability to raise prices sufficiently to cover manufacturing cost increases would harm profit margins in addition if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins our sales growth and other results of operations would suffer  

advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on retail customer decisions regarding the brands and product lines they sell and on consumer purchasing decisions a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if our advertising marketing and promotional programs are not effective our sales growth may decline  

many of our competitors are large companies including the proctor  gamble company the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson nestle purina petcare company ansell limited alere inc pfizer inc bayer ag sc johnson  son inc pharmavite llc  koninklijke philips nv unilever plc and nbty inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and therefore have the capacity to outspend us on advertising and promotional activities and introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can in addition the growing number of sales channels and business models such as niche brands internetonly brands and discounter channels have increased competition in certain product categories such as oral care from less well capitalized competitors moreover our competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by us competitive activity may require us to increase our spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced profits and adversely affect growth if we lose market share or the markets in which we compete do not grow substantially our sales growth will decline  

in addition we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of laundry detergent the continued customer demand for these products are critical to our future success as a result any commercialization delays or reduction of sales of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results

there continues to be significant product competition in the gummy dietary supplement category the category has grown from six brands to over 50 in the last eight years moreover condom usage has declined as a result of a lower 18 to 24year old population alternate birth control options less fear of hiv less sex acts and increased competition all of which have contributed to lower demand for our product we continue to evaluate and vigorously address these pressures through among other things new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending however there is no assurance this category will not decline in the future or that we will be able to offset any such decline

 



a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our net sales walmart is our largest customer accounting for approximately 24 of net sales in 2019 23 of net sales in 2018 and 24 of net sales in 2017 our top three customers accounted for approximately 36 of net sales in 2019 36 of net sales in 2018 and 36 of net sales in 2017 we expect that a significant portion of our net sales will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues as a result changes in the strategies of walmart or any of our other largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or of shelf space they dedicate to private label products could materially harm our net sales and profitability  in addition certain of our product lines are concentrated with certain customers moreover the use of evolving technology by our customers to develop more complex pricing models may lead to category pricing pressures if we were to lose a significant customer due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues this could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover our business is based primarily upon individual sales orders as we rarely enter into longterm contracts with our customers and most customer agreements include customer termination rights after short notice accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from us at any time and for any reason if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  



unfavorable and uncertain economic conditions have adversely affected and in the future may adversely affect demand for some of the categories of products we sell resulting in reduced sales volume or market share or a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin products factors that can affect demand include competitors’ products advertising and pricing actions rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs including increased costs as a result of changes in federal regulations significant shifts in government policies the deterioration of economic or trade relations between countries or regions commodity costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior including gasoline and home heating oil pricing reduced unemployment benefits in periods of high unemployment and changes in tax policies other effects of governmental shutdowns or a lapse of appropriations or fear of exposure to or actual impacts of a widespread disease outbreak such as the outbreak of a contagious disease such as the covid19 while the vast majority of our products are consumer staples that generally are less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products an increasing number of our products particularly those from our recent acquisitions are more durable in nature and are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of our customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs home stores and dollar pet and other specialty stores have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all we regularly review the financial strength of our key customers and where appropriate modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales because the same economic conditions that affect us also affect many of our suppliers we regularly conduct a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations when appropriate we identify alternate sources of materials and services to date we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers however a protracted economic downturn or recession that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 



in recent years retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally has increased this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retail customers including internetbased retailers who may demand lower pricing special packaging or impose other requirements on us these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship some of our customers particularly our highvolume retail customers have sought to obtain pricing and other concessions and better trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms to those customers our margins are reduced further if we are unable to effectively respond to the demands of our customers these customers could reduce their purchases of our products and increase their purchases of products from competitors which would harm our sales and profitability in addition reductions in inventory by our customers including as a result of consolidations in the retail industry or these customers managing their working capital requirements could result in reduced orders for our products and adversely affect our results of operations for the financial periods affected by such reductions  

protracted unfavorable market conditions have caused many of our customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell and reduce or discontinue certain of our product lines particularly those products that were not number one or two in their category 

in addition private label and retailbranded products sold by retail trade chains are typically sold at lower prices than branded products as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending our customers have discontinued or reduced distribution of some of 

 

our products to encourage those consumers to purchase the customers’ less expensive and in some cases more profitable private label and retailbranded products primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories to the extent customers discontinue or reduce distribution of our products or these products are adversely affected by customers’ actions to increase shelf space for their private label and retailbranded products we would seek to improve distribution with other customers however if our efforts are not effective our sales growth and other results as well as our market share could be adversely affected 



our performance depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing the financial difficulties of our retailer customers or changing consumer preferences consumer products such as those marketed by us are increasingly being sold by club stores dollar stores mass merchandisers and in particular internetbased and ecommerce retailers sales of our products remain strongest in the traditional mass merchandiser food and drug retail stores and our products are also being sold in club stores and dollar stores channels however alternative retail channels including ecommerce retailers hard discounters subscription services and buying clubs have become more prevalent and the volume of consumer products that are sold through such alternative retail channels is continuing to increase further consumer preferences continue to evolve due to a number of factors including fragmentation of the consumer market and changes in consumer demographics including the aging of the general population and the emergence of millennial and younger generations who have different spending consumption and purchasing habits evolving consumer concerns or perceptions regarding environmental social and governance practices of manufacturers including packaging materials such as plastic packaging and their environmental impact or sustainability a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients changing consumer sentiment toward nonlocal products or sources among millennials and other demographic groups and evolving consumer concerns or perceptions whether accurate or inaccurate regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products in addition the growing number of sales channels and business models such as niche brands internetonly brands and discounter channels may affect customer and consumer preferences  our failure to successfully respond could negatively impact our results if the current trend continues and we are not successful in further improving sales to these or the alternative retail channels noted above or adapting to changing consumer preferences our financial condition and operating results could suffer  in addition the growth of the alternative retail channels that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly private label products may reduce our ability to market and sell our products through such retailers the retail environment is changing with the growth of alternative retail channels and this could significantly change the way traditional retailers do business if these alternative retail channels were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers andor we are not successful in these alternative retail channels our margins and results of operations may be negatively impacted 



we seek to acquire or invest in businesses that offer products services or technologies that are complementary to our product categories we have made numerous significant acquisitions over the past 20 years

we may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future those acquisitions may be significantly larger than the ones completed in the past and may require the company to increase its levels of debt potentially resulting in the company being assigned a lower credit rating however we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive valuations obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions in recent periods competition from other consumer products companies that are seeking similar opportunities has been particularly strong and valuations for potential acquisition assets have been high which has placed pressure on our ability to identify structure and execute transactions in addition acquisitions and investments entail various risks including the difficulty of entering new markets or product categories the challenges of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the ongoing business of the acquired company the need to review and if necessary upgrade processes of the acquired company to conform to our own processes and applicable legal and regulatory requirements managing an increasingly broad and complex range of businesses and products and generally our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment any of these risks may divert management and other resources require us to incur unanticipated costs or delay the anticipated positive impact on our business and results of the acquisition the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent we acquire businesses that have standalone operations that cannot easily be integrated or operations or sources of supply outside of the us and canada for which products are manufactured locally by third parties these factors could harm our financial condition and operating results larger acquisitions may require us to significantly increase our levels of debt

acquired companies or operations or newlycreated ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made in addition future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the potentially dilutive issuances of new equity by us or the incurrence of additional debt or contingent liabilities all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and resources from other matters that are critical to our operations 

 



a significant percentage of our revenues come from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during 2019 approximately 82 of our sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes dietary supplements antiperspirants and deodorants our ability to achieve unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of our products by consumers relative to competitors’ products our ability to drive growth through product innovation in existing and new product categories investment in our established brands and enhanced merchandising and our ability to capture market share from our competitors   in addition we derive a large percentage of our revenues from sales of laundry detergent moreover our ability to quickly innovate to adapt our products to meet changing consumer demands is essential especially in light of ecommerce significantly reducing the barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers this risk is further heightened by the continued evolution of consumer needs habits and preferences because of shifts in us demographics reflecting various factors including cultural and socioeconomic changes if we are unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that expand our product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products we may not achieve our sales growth objectives even if we are successful in increasing sales within our product categories a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for our products could have a negative impact on our financial results 



our future performance and growth depends on our ability to successfully identify develop and introduce new products and product line extensions in addition some of our products have shorter product life spans and depend heavily on our ability to continuously and timely introduce innovative new products to the marketplace we cannot be certain that we will achieve our innovation goals the successful development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development marketing and promotional expenditures which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which we have limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays competitor actions regulatory approval hurdles and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of existing products our financial performance could be harmed  

each year we introduce new products including launches into new “white space” categories across the majority of our marketed brands historically new product acceptance has generally been widespread across the retailer base there is no assurance however that our customers and consumers will continue to purchase these new products if new products are not successful in generating sales growth our financial results could suffer from time to time we have discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs we may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet retailer or consumer expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand  



from time to time we initiate planned and unplanned expansion projects with respect to our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers as is customary with large construction projects these projects are subject to risks of and we have from time to time experienced delay or cost overruns resulting from numerous factors including the following shortages of equipment materials or skilled labor work stoppages unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment unanticipated cost increases difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions difficulties in meeting regulatory or quality requirements or obtaining regulatory approvals availability of suppliers to certify equipment for existing and enhanced regulations design and engineering problems and failure or delay of third party service providers civil unrest and labor disputes significant cost overruns or delays in completing a project or the miscalculations of our anticipated capacity needs including as a result of expansion into new product lines or into new markets could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment results of operations and cash flows if we were to experience delays or cost overruns in the future it could result in product allocation and retailer frustration the loss of a significant customer or customers or if sales of any of our products were to materially decrease due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally the supply of our products depends on the uninterrupted efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers and our ability to meet customer service levels many of our manufacturing processes and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers are complex and present difficult technical challenges to obtain the manufacturing yields necessary to operate profitably in addition our manufacturing processes and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers may require complex and specialized equipment which can be expensive to repair or replace with required lead times of up to a year

 

the manufacturing of certain of our products is concentrated in one or more of our plants  contract manufacturers or other suppliers  with limited alternate facilities any event that disrupts or otherwise negatively impacts manufacturing facilities manufacturing systems or equipment or contract manufacturers or other suppliers  including work stoppages cyberattacks acts of war fire flooding or other natural disasters could delay or suspend shipments of products or the release of new products or could result in the delivery of inferior products as a result o ur revenues from the affected products would decline and we could incur losses until such time as we or our contract manufacturers or other suppliers are able to restore production processes or are able to put in place alternative contract manufacturers or other suppliers 



we rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain of our commodities and raw materials including sole source suppliers for certain of our raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers must be qualified pursuant to our standards and may also have to be qualified under governmental and industry standards and any other standards of our customers which can require additional investment and time we may be unable to qualify any needed new contract manufacturers or suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships based on a variety of factors we may be unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for our business certain of our suppliers may not meet the standards of our customers or licensors or certain of our key contract manufacturers or suppliers may become insolvent or experience other financial distress if any of these events occurs and we have failed to identify and qualify an alternative vendor then we may be unable to meet our contractual obligations and customer expectations which could damage our reputation and result in lost customers and sales or we may incur higher than expected expenses either of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations  



the principal raw materials and packaging used by us and certain of our suppliers and contract manufacturers include surfactants cleaning agents paper products and resinbased molded components volatility and increases in the price of raw materials or increases in the costs of energy shipping and other necessary services could significantly affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution historically we have attempted to address such price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of our products entering into prebuying or lockedin pricing arrangements with certain suppliers and entering into hedge agreements there is no assurance however that we will be able to fully offset any price increases especially given the competitive environment sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share while the company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations

in addition volatility in certain commodity markets could significantly affect our production cost and therefore harm our financial condition and operating results  

from time to time we use hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of commodities and diesel fuel prices the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to product costs enabling us to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in prices over the term of the contract however in periods of declining fuel or other commodity prices the hedge agreements can have the effect of locking us in at abovemarket prices  



we distribute our products and receive raw materials and packaging components primarily by truck rail and ship and through various ports of entry reduced availability of trucking rail or shipping capacity due to adverse weather conditions natural disasters including climatic events including any potential effect of climate change allocation of assets to other industries or geographies or otherwise work stoppages strikes or shutdowns of ports of entry or such transportation sources could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials or packaging components in a timely manner which could disrupt our operations strain our customer relationships and competitive position and adversely affect our operating profits 



our financial success is directly dependent on the reputation and success of our brands particularly the arm  hammer batiste first response nair orajel oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion spinbrush waterpik xtra and flawless brands the effectiveness of these brands could suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further our results could be adversely affected if one or more of our leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived sustainability quality or safety issues including as a result of among other things a significant product recall productrelated litigation defects or impurities in our products product misuse changing consumer 

 

perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or allegations of product tampering  in addition as our sales on various ecommerce platforms grow we may be unable to prevent sales of counterfeit pirated or stolen goods unlawful or unethical sales  or sales in violati on of our policies to the extent any of this occurs it could result in customers delisting our products and damage to our reputation and business  

additionally claims made in our marketing campaigns may become subject to litigation alleging false advertising which if successful could cause us to alter our marketing plans and may materially and adversely affect sales or result in the imposition of significant damages against us or other customer or consumer dissatisfaction especially if such dissatisfaction were to be broadly disseminated including through the use of social media 

 

widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility and speed of dissemination of information negative or inaccurate posting or comments about us in the media or on any social networking website whether accurate or inaccurate or the disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information through social media could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands in addition given the association of our individual products with us an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products or us as a whole thereby potentially adversely impacting our financial results 



from time to time we are subject to product liability or other productrelated claims we may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by our products including losses or injuries caused by raw materials or other components provided by third party suppliers that are included in our products claims could be based on allegations that among other things our products contain contaminants are improperly tested labeled or designed or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings of potential dangers related to their use whether or not successful product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm our sales and operating results and the reputation of our brands in addition if one of our products is found to be defective or noncompliant with applicable rules or regulations we could be required to withdraw or recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability and product recall insurance coverage potential product liability or other productrelated damages claims andor withdrawal and recall costs may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy



 

we in the ordinary course of our business are and from time to time may become the subject of or party to various pending or threatened legal actions including class actions government investigations and proceedings including without limitation those relating to commercial transactions product liability consumer  employment antitrust environmental health safety and compliancerelated matters such proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of certain pending or threatened legal actions investigations and proceedings may not be reasonably predictable and any related damages injunctions andor settlements may not be estimable certain pending or future legal actions could result in an adverse outcome for us and any such adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 



we must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations it is possible that we could become subject to other environmental remediation costs and liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition



as climate change land use water use deforestation recyclability or recoverability of packaging ingredients and other sustainability concerns become more prevalent federal state and local governments nongovernmental organizations and our customers consumers and investors are increasingly sensitive to these issues this increased focus on sustainability may result in new laws regulations and requirements that could negatively affect us this could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with any of the foregoing we could also lose revenue if our consumers change brands or our customers move business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements 

we have recognized that our customers and consumers are increasingly demanding transparency regarding our efforts to mitigate our impacts on climate change for example during 2019 some of our major customers requested we respond to various questionnaires 

 

including the climate disclosure project “cdp” climate change and forests questionnaires and use our responses and cdp grades to evaluate us 

certain of our business activities and the production of some of the materials used in our products and certain of our business activities including petroleum based agricultural and forest materials and the growing global demand for livestock products which is a focus of our animal and food production business contribute to deforestation and climate change and reduction in biodiversity and can adversely impact water quality and availability people and communities climate change is in turn a threat to each of those activities while we strive to minimize the environmental impact of our global operations a potential loss in business could result from reduced demand for our products and loss of customers if we do not meet their expectations related to our efforts towards sustainability and fighting climate change

additionally environmentallyconscious investors may choose not to invest in our common stock if we do not comply with their demands for sustainable business practices these costs changes potential loss of revenue and potential reputational harm could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity cash flows and share price

concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment increased costs of energy or compliance with emissions standards due to increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in or increased costs associated with manufacturing our products in addition any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception whether or not valid of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new or changes in legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change or other sustainability concerns could adversely affect our business and reputation



the manufacturing processing formulation including stability packaging labeling marketing distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the ftc the epa and the cpsc in addition our and our suppliers’ operations are subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold  

in particular the fda regulates the formulation safety manufacturing packaging labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits battery operated toothbrushes overthecounter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements including vitamins and minerals the fda also exercises oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of our other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that we and our suppliers use to manufacture regulated products and may identify compliance issues that would require us and our suppliers to make certain changes in our manufacturing facilities and processes the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to regulatory action against the products made in that facility including seizure injunction or recall as well as to possible action against the owner of the facilitymanufacturer we may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until the compliance issue has been remediated as a result our business could be adversely affected  

likewise any future determination by the fda or a similar foreign agency or by us in reviewing our compliance with applicable rules and regulations that our products or quality systems do not comply with applicable regulations could result in future compliance activities including product withdrawals or recalls import detentions injunctions preventing the shipment of products or other enforcement actions for example the fda may determine that a particular claim that we use to support the marketing of a product is not substantiated may not accept the evidence of safety for a new product that we may wish to market may challenge the safety or effectiveness of existing products based on among other things changes in formulations inadequate stability or “shelflife” consumer complaints or improper labeling and may determine that our dietary supplement business manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations do not comply with cgmps similarly we may identify these or other issues in internal compliance reviews of our operations and the operations and products of vendors and acquired companies these other issues may include the identification of contaminants or noncompliant levels of particular ingredients any of the foregoing could subject us to adverse publicity force us to incur unanticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  additionally delays in the acceptance review and approval of products by the fda or other required governmental approvals may result from government shutdowns due to the failure by congress to enact regular appropriations 

in 2019 our vitafusion brand launched cbd full spectrum hemp extract gummies a new product line made with full spectrum hemp extract containing cannabidiol “cbd” which was exempted from certain federal regulation as a controlled substance under the agriculture improvement act of 2018 the “2018 farm bill” the 2018 farm bill did not eliminate or affect regulation of cbd by the fda ftc or state governments we believe that our new product line complies with applicable fda requirements although the fda takes the position that cbd products cannot be marketed as dietary supplements and that cbd cannot be added to food to date the fda’s enforcement activity has focused primarily on cbd products that bear express or implied claims suggesting that the products are intended to treat cure prevent or mitigate a disease the ftc has similarly focused on disease claims our products do not bear disease claims

 

the fda is considering whether to engage in rulemaking to permit the marketing of cbd products as dietary supplements  there has also been discussion of legislative changes for example hr 5587 was introduced in january 2020 hr5587 would amend the fdc act to include hempderived cbd in the definition of a dietary supplement although state laws have been evolving in the wake of the 2018 farm bill we do not intend to sell our products in states that continue to prohibit sales of certain hempbased cbd products the fda and certain states and local governments may enact regulations or change their enforcement priorities in a manner that further limits the marketing and use of cbd products we do not know what the impact of such regulatory activities would be on our products and what costs requirements and possible prohibitions may be associated with such regulatory activities our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or fda’s or any other state’s disagreeing with our interpretation of the fda or applicable state requirements could result in among other things administrative civil or criminal penalties or fines product seizure mandatory or voluntary product recalls warning or untitled letters cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance closure of facilities or operations the loss revocation or modification of any existing licenses permits registrations or approvals or the failure to obtain additional licenses permits registrations or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations these laws and regulations may change in the future and we may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current or future laws and regulations or in any product recalls 

from time to time congress the fda the ftc the commission or other federal state local or foreign legislative and regulatory authorities may impose additional laws or regulations that apply to us repeal laws or regulations that we consider favorable or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations for example we are subject to regulations regarding the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment as well as the commission’s rules with respect to “conflict minerals” additionally recent reform proposals have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries in addition to the major changes to us tax law signed into law in 2017 major developments in trade relations could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations we are not able to predict the nature of these changes or of such future laws regulations repeals or interpretations or to predict the effect additional or shifting governmental regulation when and if it occurs would have on our business in the future such developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated additional recordkeeping requirements increased documentation of the properties of certain products additional or different labeling additional scientific substantiation expanded adverse event reporting or other new requirements any such developments could increase our costs significantly and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  



our international operations subject us to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 



























in addition changes as result of the united kingdom’s decision and subsequent negotiations to exit the eu could subject us to heightened risks in that region including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods services and people to and from the united kingdom increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and additional legal and economic uncertainty additional costs have been incurred in 2019 because of measures implemented to address or mitigate risks there is a risk that the exit will cause a material rise in the cost of doing business in the uk moreover in all foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions the recent imposition of tariffs on products imported from certain countries has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries major developments in trade relations including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the us andor other countries and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which in turn could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations all the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to commercialize our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 

 



our ability to continue to grow our sales and profits is dependent on expanding in the locations in which we already do business and entering into new geographic locations both of which would require significant resources and investments which would affect our risk profile the failure to successfully enter into or expand our business in such locations could materially affect the growth of our business sales and results of operations 



the company’s financial projections are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to among other things category growth development and launch of innovative new products market share projections product pricing volume and product mix foreign exchange rates and volatility commodity prices distribution cost savings accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves and the company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in its existing business fund internal growth repurchase its stock make acquisitions pay dividends and meet debt obligations while the company’s financial projections are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made the company’s actual results may differ materially from its financial projections any material variation between the company’s financial projections and its actual results may adversely affect the company’s future profitability cash flows and stock price



as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 2063 million of total consolidated indebtedness net of debt issuance costs this amount of indebtedness could have important consequences including













additionally our credit facility is subject to certain financial and other customary covenants  in the event of a breach of those covenants our lenders under the credit facility may be entitled to accelerate the related debt and any lenders in respect of any other debt to which a crossdefault provision applies may be entitled to accelerate such other debt and we could be required to seek amendments or waivers under the debt instruments or to refinance the debt

moreover we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes if additional new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify a substantial increase in our indebtedness could also have a negative impact on our credit ratings  in this regard failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate available to us in future financings as well as our liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets any decision regarding future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time including market conditions and our credit ratings  



our ability to repay and refinance our indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends primarily on our cash flow cash flow is often subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control and such factors may limit our ability to repay indebtedness and fund capital expenditures a failure to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition  

 



we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to conduct our business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to internal communications and communications with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers billing customers and receiving and applying payment processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements collecting and storing customer consumer employee investor and other stakeholder information and personal data and other processes necessary to manage our business the company sells certain of its products directly to consumers online and through websites mobile apps and connected devices and the company offers promotions rebates customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information and the company or its vendors could experience cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or other incidents that may result in unauthorized access disclosure and misuse of consumer customer employee vendor or company information 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including ransomware denial of service and phishing attacks and advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems networks and services and those of our customers and other business partners as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and the data of our customers and other business partners as a result our information technology systems networks or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or we could suffer a loss or disclosure of business personal or stakeholder information due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages and security breaches although we have business continuity plans in place and have implemented a breach response plan to address service interruptions if these plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct our operations which may adversely affect our business in addition if our service providers suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations which would adversely affect our business

our information technology systems and our thirdparty providers’ systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing social engineering hacking and other cyberattacks such attacks may originate from nation states or attempts by outside parties hackers criminal organizations or other threat actors in addition insider actorsmalicious or otherwisecould cause technical disruptions andor confidential data leakage to date we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks however we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers’ databases or systems in addition although we have policies and procedures in place governing the secure storage of personal information collected by us or our thirdparty service providers data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct may occur in the future 

 

although we are currently implementing enterprisewide upgrades to our systems and will continue to monitor and upgrade systems as appropriate legacy systems may be vulnerable to increased risk additionally if a new system does not function properly it could affect our ability to order supplies process and deliver customer orders and process and receive payments for our products this could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows moreover because the techniques tools and tactics used in cyberattacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack as such we may need to expend additional resources and incur additional costs in the future to continue to protect against or address problems caused by any business interruptions or data security breaches



 

we collect use and store personal data of our employees customers and other third parties in the ordinary course of business and we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy and security laws and regulations that apply to the collection storage use transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer and employee data including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries 

 

numerous local municipal state federal and international law and regulations address privacy and security including the california online privacy protection act the personal information protection and electronic documents act the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing canspam act the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa section 5c of the federal trade commission act and effective as of january 1 2020 the california consumer privacy act ccpa these privacy and security laws and regulations change frequently and new legislation continues to be introduced in particular the ccpa requires new disclosures to california consumers  gives california consumers new rights with respect to their data and permits california consumers to optout of certain sales of personal information the ccpa provides for fines of up to 7500 per violation

 

in europe the european union eu has adopted strict data privacy regulations following the passage of the eu’s general data protection regulation eu 2016679 “gdpr” and the regulation on privacy and electronic communications the “eprivacy 

 

regulation” data privacy and security compliance in the eu are increasingly complex and challenging the gdpr in particular has broad extraterritorial effect and imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with significant penalties for noncompliance up to 4 of worldwide annual turnover or €20 million whichever is higher it is also important to note that many countries are following the eu in producing a broad omnibus law in relation to privacy protection for instance brazil has just published a gdprlike law in general the gdpr and eprivacy regulation ccpa and other local privacy laws could also require adaptation of our technologies or practices  increase d costs and changes to operations to satisfy local privacy requirements and standards 

 

we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines penalties or orders to cease delay or modify collection use or transfers of personal data we could also face rights requests complaints claims or litigation from those persons whose data we collect use and store as well as government investigations and fines any of these events or other circumstances related to our collection use and transfer of personal data could also lead to negative media attention damage to our reputation in the market or otherwise adversely affect our business



any board determinations to repurchase our common stock or to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock in each case at levels consistent with recent practice or at all will be based primarily upon our financial condition results of operations business requirements price of our common stock in the case of the repurchase programs our ability to access debt capital markets or other sources of financing and the board’s continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event we do not declare a quarterly dividend or discontinue our share repurchases our stock price could be adversely affected  



over the years the banking system and financial markets have experienced severe disruption including among other things bank failures and consolidations severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades declines in asset valuations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these conditions present the following risks to us among others

we are dependent on the continued viability of the financial institutions that participate in the syndicate that is generally obligated to fund our 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility as amended the “credit agreement” in addition the credit agreement includes a “commitment increase” feature that enables us to increase the amount of our borrowing under the credit agreement subject to lending commitments and certain conditions any disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 

our short and longterm credit ratings affect our borrowing costs and access to financing a downgrade in our credit ratings as a result of a substantial increase in our indebtedness or otherwise would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit market also could raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings either scenario could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets

although we believe that our operating cash flows together with our access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity the inability of one or more institutions to fulfill funding obligations under the credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations  



approximately 18 of our net sales in 2019 were to customers outside the us we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk both transaction and translation with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar outside of the us sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the canadian dollar euro pound mexican peso and australian dollar among others a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we purchase materials and services in foreign markets although we from time to time enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed sales or purchases denominated in the us dollar canadian dollar pound euro mexican peso and australian dollar foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 



libor the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt including our revolving credit facility term loan and interest rate swaps is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021 when privatesector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate without this data libor may no longer be published or the lack of quality and quantity of data may cause the rate to no longer be representative of the market at this time no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to libor although the us federal reserve in connection with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions selected the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the rate that represents best practice for replacing us dollar libor for use in new us dollar derivatives and other financial contracts and has recommended a paced transition plan that involves the creation of a reference rate based on sofr by the end of 2021 sofr is a more generic measure than libor and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities given the inherent differences between libor and sofr or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from libor including but not limited to the need to amend all contracts with libor as the reference rate and how this will impact the company’s cost of variable rate debt and certain derivative financial instruments the company will also need to consider new contracts and if they should reference an alternative benchmark rate or include suggested fallback language as published by the alternative reference rates committee the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt or derivative financial instruments which may be detrimental to our financial position or operating results



the market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and brand names including arm  hammer batiste first response nair orajel oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion spinbrush waterpik xtra and flawless we own the material trademarks and brand names used in connection with the marketing and distribution of our major products both in the us and in other countries in addition we hold several valuable patents on our products which we believe serve as an effective barrier to entry for new competitors accordingly we rely on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights although most of our material intellectual property is registered in the us and in certain foreign countries in which we operate we cannot be sure that our intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or if necessary successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future and we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties infringe our intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with our brands and harm our sales our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition also our patents are granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed we do not consider any single patent to be material to the business as a whole  

in addition if our products are found to infringe intellectual property rights of others the owners of those rights could bring legal actions against us claiming substantial damages for past infringement and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products if these legal actions are successful in addition to any potential liability for damages from past infringement we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products potentially adding significant costs we might not prevail in any action brought against us or we may be unsuccessful in securing any license for continued use and therefore have to discontinue the marketing and sale of a product this could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition  



we have a material amount of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets as well as other longlived tangible assets which are periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards declines in our profitability andor estimated cash flows related to specific intangible assets as well as potential changes in market valuations for similar assets and market discount rates has resulted in impairment charges from time to time and may result in future impairment charges which could reduce our net income and otherwise have an adverse impact on operating results 



our operations as well as the operations of our thirdparty manufacturers suppliers and customers may be subject to disruption from a variety of causes including material shortages financial difficulties work stoppages cyberattacks and other disruptions in information 

 

technology systems demonstrations disease outbreaks for example an outbreak of a contagious disease such as covid 19 or pandemics  acts of war terrorism fire earthquake s  flooding or other natural disasters  disruptions in logistics loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites supplier capacity constraints raw material and product quality or safety issues industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues  additionally as certain of our businesses grow at unanticipated levels we may be required to add capacity requiring substantial and unanticipated capital expenditures if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  



our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in addition we evaluate our deferred income tax assets and record a valuation allowance if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized if the actual amount of our future taxable income is less than the amount we are currently projecting with respect to specific tax jurisdictions or if there is a change in the time period within which the deferred tax asset becomes deductible we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets the recording of a valuation allowance would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on our operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances which would have either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate major developments in tax policy or trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and liquidity



on december 22 2017 the president signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act which made significant changes to the code including a reduction in the statutory corporate income tax rate to 21 a new limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense restrictions on the use of net operating loss carryforwards arising in taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and changes to the taxation of income earned from foreign sources and foreign subsidiaries including requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the tax cuts and jobs act also authorizes the treasury department to issue regulations with respect to the new provisions we cannot predict how the changes in the tax cuts and jobs act regulations other guidance issued under it or conforming or nonconforming state tax rules might affect us or our business in addition there can be no assurance that us tax laws including the corporate income tax rate would not undergo significant changes in the near future



significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we provide for uncertain tax positions with respect to tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards mandated by applicable accounting guidance fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results we are regularly under audit by tax authorities and although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution additionally adverse outcomes from tax audits that we may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results



our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations this effect could be exacerbated if any officers or other key personnel left as a group or at the same time our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future  factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of key employees include employee morale our reputation competition from other employers and the availability of qualified personnel in a tightening labor market 



the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for 

 

external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company’s financial statements would be prevented or detected the company’s continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets such as its acquisition of waterpik flawless passport and others may place significant additional pressure on the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting and require the company to update its internal control over financial reporting to integrate such acquisitions moreover the company engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes which injects additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control when the company is required to comply with new or revised accounting standards it must make any appropriate changes to its internal control over financial reporting to fully implement the standards which may require significant effort and judgment any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company’s ability to report its results of operations accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose it to regulatory enforcement action and stockholder claims which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 



in recent years proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies including the company many companies in the company’s industry have been subject to unsolicited takeover proposals or other activist campaigns if such a campaign or proposal were to be made against the company the company would likely incur significant costs which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance strategic direction and operations of the company through stockholder proposals or otherwise such proposals may disrupt the company’s business and divert the attention of the company’s management and employees and any perceived uncertainties as to the company’s future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities the perception that the company needs a change in the direction of its business or the perception that the company is unstable or lacks continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to our current or potential customers and may make it more difficult for the company to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners which could adversely affect the company’s business in addition actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business the company may also be the target of short sellers who engage in negative publicity campaigns that may use selective information that may be presented out of context or that may misrepresent facts and circumstances during 2019 the company was the target of a negative publicity campaign by a shortseller which negatively impacted our stock price

strategic goals challenges and initiatives

our ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for our products and retail customers’ decisions to carry our products which are in part affected by general economic conditions in our markets while a vast majority of our products are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products an increasing number of our products particularly those from our recent acquisitions are more durable in nature and are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories launching their own brands and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading

brands in each category in addition an increasing portion of our product categories is being sold by club stores dollar stores  mass merchandisers and internetbased retailers  these factors have placed downward pressure on our sales and gross margins 

we expect a competitive marketplace in 2020 due to new product introductions by competitors in this environment we intend to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives maintain competitive marketing and trade spending tightly control our cost structure continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursue strategic acquisitions we also intend to continue to grow our product sales globally and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products to appeal to a wide range of consumers

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of laundry detergent the continued customer demand for these products are critical to our future success as a result any commercialization delays or reduction of sales of these products in the event that our diversification efforts discussed below are not successful could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition there continues to be significant product competition in the gummy vitamin category the category has grown from six brands to over 50 in the last eight years moreover condom usage has declined as a result of a lower 18 to 24year old population alternate birth control options less fear of hiv less sex acts and increased competition all of which have contributed to lower demand for our product we continue to evaluate and vigorously address these pressures through among other things new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending however there is no assurance that the category will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline 

we are continuously focused on strengthening our key brands such as arm  hammer oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion batiste waterpik and flawless  through the launch of innovative new products which span various product categories including premium and value household products supported by increased marketing and trade spending there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 

in the domestic business ten out of 12 “power brands” met or exceeded category growth for the full year 2019 our global product portfolio consists of both premium 63 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2019 and value 37 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2019 brands which we believe enables us to succeed in a range of economic environments we intend to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among costconscious consumers 

over the past two decades we have diversified from an almost exclusively us business to a global company with approximately 18 of sales derived from international countries in 2019 we have subsidiary operations in six countries canada mexico uk france germany and australia and sell to over 130 other countries in 2019 we benefited from our expanded global footprint and expect to continue to focus on selectively expanding our global business if we are unable to expand our business internationally at the rate that we expect we may not realize the operational benefits that we anticipate 

although we believe ongoing international expansion represents a significant opportunity to grow our business our increasing activity in global markets exposes us to additional complexity and uncertainty net sales generated outside of the us are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as political uncertainty which could impact future operating results moreover the current domestic and international political environment including existing and potential changes to us policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty regarding the global economy the impact of us tariffs on certain products was a component of increased cost of sale during the year ended december 31 2019 the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we manufacture or sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition

we also continue to focus on controlling our costs historically we have been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent by passing along some of these cost increases to customers we have also entered into set pricing and prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel and other commodities should we be required to address cost increases by increasing the prices that our customers pay for our products we cannot be certain they will be accepted additionally maintaining tight controls on overhead costs has been a hallmark of ours and has enabled us to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions 

the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of our overall strategy and product category diversification acquisitions have added significantly to our sales and profits and product category diversification over the last decade this is evidenced by our 2015 acquisition of certain assets of varied industries corporation the “vicor acquisition” 2016 acquisitions of spencer forrest inc the maker of toppik the “toppik acquisition” and the anusol and rectinol businesses from johnson  johnson the “anusol acquisition” 2017 acquisitions of viviscal from lifes2good holdings limited the “viviscal acquisition” agro biosciences inc the “agro acquisition” and waterpik from pik holdings inc the “waterpik acquisition” 2018 acquisition of passport food safety solutions inc the “passport acquisition” and the flawless acquisition in 2019  however the failure to effectively identify or integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause us to incur material asset writedowns we actively seek acquisitions that fit our guidelines and our strong financial position provides us with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in addition our ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled us to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions since 2001 we have acquired 11 of our 12 “power brands”

we believe we are positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to our strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives maintaining competitive marketing and trade spending managing our cost structure continuing to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursuing strategic acquisitions this focus together with the strength of our portfolio of premium and value brands has enabled us to succeed in a range of economic environments  and is expected to position us to continue to increase stockholder value over the longterm moreover the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations as a result of net income and effective working capital management combined with an investment grade credit rating provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions drive new product development make capital expenditures to support organic growth and gross margin improvements return cash to stockholders through dividends and share buy backs and reduce outstanding debt positioning us to continue to create stockholder value

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty they are based on our historical experience our observation of trends in industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate our significant accounting policies and estimates are described below 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves

virtually all of our revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by our customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for our products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements and coupons are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold we rely on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example we use historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements a difference of approximately 12 in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns we use experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if our estimates for promotional activities and sales returns reserves were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 66 while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations 

impairment of goodwill trade names and other intangible assets 

carrying values of goodwill and indefinitelived trade names are reviewed periodically for possible impairment  finite intangible assets are assessed when there are business triggering events our impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trade names and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired the result of our annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units in addition there were no goodwill impairment charges for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2019

 

fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” or “excess earnings” discounted cash flow method which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change and therefore could impact fair values in the future we determined that the fair value of all other intangible assets for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2019 exceeded their respective carrying values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability there are personal care trade names that based on recent performance had experienced sales and profit declines that had eroded a significant portion of the excess between fair and carrying value which could potentially result in an impairment of the assets these excesses had been reduced due in large part to an increased competitive market environment therefore resulting in reduced cash flow projections these indefinitelived intangible assets could still be susceptible to impairment risk  while management can and has implemented strategies to address the risk significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of these assets 

it is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if for example i the businesses or brands do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized we record liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under us gaap guidelines the liabilities relate to tax return positions that although supportable by us may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement we adjust this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change in this regard settlement of any issue or an adverse determination in litigation with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate conversely favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate

competition

we compete in the household and personal care consumer product categories which are highly innovative categories characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and require significant advertising and promotion we compete in these categories primarily on the basis of product innovation and performance brand recognition price value and other consumer benefits consumer products particularly laundry and dietary supplements are subject to significant price competition as a result we from time to time may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share product introductions typically involve heavy marketing and trade spending in the year of launch and we usually are not able to determine whether the new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product line

because of the competitive retail environment we face pricing pressure from our retail customers and customers selling through other channels particularly highvolume retail customers including internet based retailers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms that could reduce our margins furthermore if we are unable to maintain price or trade terms 

 

acceptable to our customers they could increase product purchases from competitors and reduce purchases from us  which would ha rm our sales and profitability 

our competitors in the consumer domestic and consumer international segments include pg the clorox company colgatepalmolive company sc johnson  son inc nestle purina petcare company henkel reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson ansell limited pfizer inc bayer ag alere inc nbty inc and pharmavite llc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and have the capacity to outspend us in their attempts to gain market share

competition within our specialty chemicals and animal productivity product lines is intense the specialty chemicals business operates in a competitive environment influenced by capacity utilization customers ’ leverage and the impact of raw material and energy costs product introductions typically involve introductory educational costs in the year of launch and we usually are not able to determine whether new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of new products or the extension of the product lines our key competitors with respect to our spd segment are archer daniels midland company cargill incorporated lallemand inc solvay chemicals inc genesis alkali and natural soda inc for additional discussion of the competitive environment in which we conduct our business see item 1a risk factors

raw materials and sources of supply

we manufacture sodium bicarbonate for our consumer and specialty products businesses at our plants located at green river wyoming and old fort ohio the primary source of soda ash a basic raw material used in the production of sodium bicarbonate is the mineral trona which is found in abundance in southwestern wyoming near our green river plant we have adequate trona reserves under mineral leases to support our sodium bicarbonate requirements for the foreseeable future 

we are a party to a partnership agreement with tata chemicals soda ash partners which mines and processes trona reserves in wyoming we fulfill a substantial amount of our soda ash requirements through the partnership and related supply and services agreements enabling us to achieve some of the economies of an integrated business capable of producing sodium bicarbonate and related products from the basic raw material we also have an agreement for the supply of soda ash from another company the partnership agreement and other supply agreements between the tata chemicals soda ash partners and us are terminable upon two years notice by either of us we believe that sufficient alternative sources of soda ash supply are available

we believe that ample sources of raw materials are available for all our other major products detergent chemicals are used in a variety of our products and are available from a number of sources bottles paper products and clay are available from multiple suppliers although we choose to source most of these materials from single sources under longterm supply agreements in order to gain favorable economies of scale we also use certifiable sustainable palm oil derivatives in a number of products including 

 

primarily in our rumen bypass fats products altern ative sources of supply are available in case of the disruption or termination of the supply agreements 

the cost of raw materials including surfactants diesel fuel and oilbased raw and packaging materials used primarily in our consumer businesses were higher in 2018 relative to 2017 increasing our core commodity costs increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact our costs and financial results if we are unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to our customers

us patents are currently granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed although we actively seek and maintain a number of patents no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole 

customers and order backlog 

in each of the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 net sales to our largest customer walmart inc and its affiliates  “ walmart ”  were 23 24 and 24 respectively of our consolidated net sales no other customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales in the threeyear period the time between receipt of orders and shipment is generally short and as a result backlog is not significant 

government regulation

general

some of our products are subject to regulation by one or more us agencies including the us food and drug administration  “ fda ”  the environmental protection agency  “ epa ”  the federal trade commission  “ ftc ”  the consumer product safety commission  “ cpsc ”  and foreign agencies 

fda regulations govern a variety of matters relating to our products such as product development manufacturing premarket clearance or approval advertising and distribution the regulations adopted and standards imposed by the fda and similar foreign agencies evolve over time and can require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes and quality systems to remain in compliance these agencies periodically inspect manufacturing and other facilities if we fail to comply with applicable regulations and standards we may be subject to sanctions including fines and penalties the recall of products and cessation of manufacturing andor distribution 

in addition we sell products that are subject to regulation under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and the toxic substances control act both of which are administered by the epa 

we are also subject to regulation by the ftc in connection with the content and truthfulness of our labeling advertising promotion trade practices and other matters the ftc has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of otherwise false or misleading advertising claims these enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties andor restitution by the companies involved such actions can result in substantial financial penalties and significantly restrict the marketing of a dietary supplement

the cpsc administers the poison prevention packaging act and has issued regulations requiring special child resistant packaging for certain products including pharmaceuticals dietary supplements and dietary substances containing certain ingredients eg iron

our relationship with certain union employees is regulated by various agencies of the countries states provinces and other localities in which we sell our products

to be commercially distributed in the us a medical device must unless exempt receive clearance or approval from the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act  “ fdca ”  for lower risk class ii devices we must generally submit a premarket notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution known as a “ 510k ” clearance our condoms lubricants contact lens solution wound wash and home pregnancy test kits are regulated as class ii devices some other low risk devices including spinbrush and other battery powered toothbrushes are in class i and are generally exempted from the 510k requirement to obtain 510k clearance a device must be determined to be substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a benchmark device or “ predicate ” that is already legally in commercial distribution any modification to a 510k cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a change in its intended use generally requires a new 510k clearance we may determine that a new 510k clearance is not required but if the fda disagrees it may retroactively require a 510k clearance and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified device until 510k clearance is obtained 

medical device postmarket regulation

after a medical device is commercialized numerous regulatory requirements apply including 



otc pharmaceutical

we market overthecounter  “ otc ”  pharmaceutical products such as toothpaste antiperspirant and oral analgesics products that are also subject to fda and foreign regulation under the us otc monograph system selected otc pharmaceutical products are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the submission and approval of a new drug application the fda otc monographs include wellknown ingredients and specify requirements for permitted indications required warnings and precautions allowable combinations of ingredients and dosage levels pharmaceutical products marketed under the otc monograph system must conform to specific quality formula and labeling requirements

all facilities where otc pharmaceutical products are manufactured tested packaged stored or distributed must comply with cgmp regulations andor regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries where the facilities are located all of our pharmaceutical products are manufactured tested packaged stored and distributed according to cgmp regulations the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that our facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representations made to customers or to regulatory action against us related to the products made in that facility such as seizure injunction or recall serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against us that among other things could result in the suspension of production or distribution of our products product seizures loss of certain licenses or other governmental penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results we are required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of our otc pharmaceutical products marketed in the us 

we cannot predict whether new legislation regulating our activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on our business

food products

we market baking soda and animal feed products such as rumen fermentation enhancers and dietary cationanion difference  “ dcad ”  balancers that are also subject to fda and foreign regulation the food safety modernization act  “ fsma ”  regulates food and animal feed products and mandates preventive controls including hazard analysis risk controls supplier qualifications and controls and increased record keeping fsma grants the fda the authority to require mandatory recalls for products under certain 

 

conditions the fda is currently in the process of establishing rules and guidance to implement the provisions of fsma the potential impact of these rules and applicable guidance canno t be determined now 

dietary supplements

the processing formulation safety manufacturing packaging labeling advertising distribution importing selling and storing of dietary supplements are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies including the fda the ftc the cpsc the epa and by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold the fdca governs the composition safety labeling manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements 

dietary ingredients that were not marketed in the us before october 15 1994 must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the fda at least 75 days before the initial marketing unless the ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for food without being chemically altered the notification must provide evidence of a history of use or other evidence establishing that use of the dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe the fda may determine that notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a new ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe which could effectively prevent the marketing of the ingredient on july 5 2011 the fda issued draft guidance governing notification of new dietary ingredients for public comment and not for implementation the fda has not taken any further steps to implement the guidance which if implemented could effectively change the status of dietary ingredients that the industry has marketed as “ old ” dietary ingredients to “ new ” dietary ingredients that may require submission of a new dietary ingredient notification 

a company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess information substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading if the fda determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim or if the fda determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific evidence or is otherwise false or misleading the claim could not be used and any product bearing the claim could be subject to regulatory action

the fda ’ s cgmp regulations govern the manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers as with otc products the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that our dietary supplement facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representation made to consumers or to regulatory action against us related to the products made in that facility seizure injunction or recall there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the fda ’ s interpretation and implementation of the cgmp regulations the failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cgmp regulations may render products manufactured in that facility adulterated and subjects those products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential fda enforcement actions the manufacturer packer or distributor of a dietary supplement marketed in the us whose name appears on the label of the supplement is required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of that supplement to the fda 

additional legislation may be introduced which if passed would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements the effect of additional domestic or international governmental legislation regulations or administrative orders if and when promulgated cannot be determined new legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards and require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations relating to environmental concerns including air emissions wastewater discharges solid and hazardous waste management activities and the safety of our employees we endeavor to take actions necessary to comply with such regulations these steps include periodic environmental and health and safety audits of our facilities the audits conducted by independent firms with expertise in environmental health and safety compliance include site visits at each location as well as a review of documentary information to determine compliance with such federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations 

employees 

at december 31 2018 we had approximately 4700 employees internationally we employ union employees in france mexico brazil and new zealand we believe our relations with both our union and nonunion employees are satisfactory

 i tem   1a risk factors 

the following risks and uncertainties as well as other factors described elsewhere in this annual report or in our other filings with the commission could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 



unfavorable and uncertain economic conditions have adversely affected and in the future may adversely affect demand for some of the categories of products we sell resulting in reduced sales volume or market share or a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin products factors that can affect demand include competitors’ products advertising and pricing actions rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs including increased costs as a result of changes in federal regulations significant shifts in government policies commodity costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior including delays in the timing of tax refunds from the federal government gasoline and home heating oil pricing reduced unemployment benefits in periods of high unemployment and changes in tax policies or other effects of governmental shutdowns or a lapse of appropriations while the vast majority of our products are consumer staples that generally are less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products certain products have become and others may become subject to increasing price competition additionally some of our products such as laundry additives gummy dietary supplements batteryoperated toothbrushes and water flossers are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of our customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs home stores and dollar pet and other specialty stores have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all we regularly review the financial strength of our key customers and where appropriate modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales because the same economic conditions that affect us also affect many of our suppliers we regularly conduct a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations when appropriate we identify alternate sources of materials and services to date we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers however a protracted economic downturn or recession that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our sales and results of operations  



we face intense competition from consumer products companies both in the us and in international markets most of our products compete with other widelyadvertised promoted and merchandised brands within each product category and from retailers including supermarkets mass merchandisers wholesale clubs drugstores convenience stores home stores dollar and other discount stores pet and other specialty stores and websites and other ecommerce channels which are increasingly offering private label brands and generic nonbranded products of our customers in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices 

our products generally compete on the basis of performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers consumer products are subject to significant price competition as a result we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase prices by an amount that does not cover manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices or inability to raise prices sufficiently to cover manufacturing cost increases would harm profit margins in addition if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins our sales growth and other results of operations would suffer  

advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on retail customer decisions regarding the brands and product lines they sell and on consumer purchasing decisions a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if our advertising marketing and promotional programs are not effective our sales growth may decline  

many of our competitors are large companies including the proctor  gamble company the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson nestle purina petcare company ansell limited alere inc pfizer inc bayer ag sc johnson  son inc pharmavite llc and nbty inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and therefore have the capacity to outspend us on advertising and promotional activities and introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can in addition our competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by us competitive activity may require us to increase our spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to 

 

reduced profits and adversely affect growth if we lose market share or the markets in which we compete do not grow substantially our sales growth will decline  

in addition we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of laundry detergent the continued customer demand for these products are critical to our future success as a result any commercialization delays or reduction of sales of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results

there continues to be significant product competition in the gummy dietary supplement category the category has grown from eight competitors to 30 in the last five years we continue to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through among other things new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending however there is no assurance this category will not decline in the future or that we will be able to offset any such decline



a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our net sales walmart is our largest customer accounting for approximately 23 of net sales in 2018 24 of net sales in 2017 and 24 of net sales in 2016 our top three customers accounted for approximately 36 of net sales in 2018 36 of net sales in 2017 and 35 of net sales in 2016 we expect that a significant portion of our net sales will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues as a result changes in the strategies of walmart or any of our other largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or of shelf space they dedicate to private label products could materially harm our net sales and profitability  in addition certain of our product lines are concentrated with certain customers moreover the use of evolving technology by our customers to develop more complex pricing models may lead to category pricing pressures if we were to lose a significant customer due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues this could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover our business is based primarily upon individual sales orders as we rarely enter into longterm contracts with our customers and most customer agreements include customer termination rights after short notice accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from us at any time and for any reason if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  



in recent years retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally has increased this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retail customers including internet based retailers who may demand lower pricing special packaging or impose other requirements on us these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship some of our customers particularly our highvolume retail customers have sought to obtain pricing and other concessions and better trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms to those customers our margins are reduced further if we are unable to effectively respond to the demands of our customers these customers could reduce their purchases of our products and increase their purchases of products from competitors which would harm our sales and profitability in addition reductions in inventory by our customers including as a result of consolidations in the retail industry or these customers managing their working capital requirements could result in reduced orders for our products and adversely affect our results of operations for the financial periods affected by such reductions  

protracted unfavorable market conditions have caused many of our customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell and reduce or discontinue certain of our product lines particularly those products that were not number one or two in their category 

in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains are typically sold at lower prices than branded products as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending our customers have discontinued or reduced distribution of some of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase the customers’ less expensive and in some cases more profitable private label products primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories to the extent customers discontinue or reduce distribution of our products or these products are adversely affected by customers’ actions to increase shelf space for their private label products we would seek to improve distribution with other customers however if our efforts are not effective our sales growth and other results as well as our market share could be adversely affected 

 



our performance depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and the financial difficulties of our retailer customers consumer products such as those marketed by us are increasingly being sold by club stores dollar stores mass merchandisers and in particular internetbased and ecommerce retailers sales of our products remain strongest in the traditional mass merchandiser food and drug retail stores and our products are also being sold in club stores and dollar stores channels however alternative retail channels including ecommerce retailers hard discounters subscription services and buying clubs have become more prevalent and the volume of consumer products that are sold through such alternative retail channels is continuing to increase in addition the growing number of sales channels and business models such as niche brands internet only brands and discounter channels may affect customer and consumer preferences  our failure to successfully respond could negatively impact our results in particular the growing presence of ecommerce retailers has affected and may continue to affect consumer preferences and market dynamics although we have taken steps to improve and have seen improvement in sales to club stores dollar stores and internetbased retailers and are engaged in ecommerce with respect to our toppik viviscal feline pine and waterpik brands if the current trend continues and we are not successful in further improving sales to these or the alternative retail channels noted above our financial condition and operating results could suffer  in addition the growth of the alternative retail channels that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly private label products may reduce our ability to market and sell our products through such retailers the retail environment is changing with the growth of alternative retail channels and this could significantly change the way traditional retailers do business if these alternative retail channels were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers andor we are not successful in these alternative retail channels our margins and results of operations may be negatively impacted 



a significant percentage of our revenues come from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during 2018 approximately 82 of our sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes dietary supplements antiperspirants and deodorants our ability to achieve unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of our products by consumers relative to competitors’ products our ability to drive growth through product innovation in existing and new product categories investment in our established brands and enhanced merchandising and our ability to capture market share from our competitors in addition we derive a large percentage of our revenues from sales of laundry detergent moreover our ability to quickly innovate to adapt our products to meet changing consumer demands is essential especially in light of ecommerce significantly reducing the barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers this risk is further heightened by the continued evolution of consumer needs habits and preferences because of shifts in us demographics reflecting various factors including cultural and socioeconomic changes if we are unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that expand our product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products we may not achieve our sales growth objectives even if we are successful in increasing sales within our product categories a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for our products could have a negative impact on our financial results 



our future performance and growth depends on our ability to successfully identify develop and introduce new products and product line extensions we cannot be certain that we will achieve our innovation goals the successful development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development marketing and promotional expenditures which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which we have limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays competitor actions regulatory approval hurdles and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of existing products our financial performance could be harmed  

each year we introduce new products including launches into new “white space” categories across the majority of our marketed brands historically new product acceptance has generally been widespread across the retailer base there is no assurance however that our customers and consumers will continue to purchase these new products if new products are not successful in generating sales growth our financial results could suffer from time to time we have discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs we may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet retailer or consumer expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand  

 



from time to time we initiate planned and unplanned expansion projects with respect to our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers as is customary with large construction projects these projects are subject to risks of and we have from time to time experienced delay or cost overruns resulting from numerous factors including the following shortages of equipment materials or skilled labor work stoppages unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment unanticipated cost increases difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions difficulties in meeting regulatory or quality requirements or obtaining regulatory approvals availability of suppliers to certify equipment for existing and enhanced regulations design and engineering problems and failure or delay of third party service providers civil unrest and labor disputes significant cost overruns or delays in completing a project or the miscalculations of our anticipated capacity needs including as a result of expansion into new product lines or into new markets could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment results of operations and cash flows if we were to experience delays or cost overruns in the future it could result in product allocation and retailer frustration the loss of a significant customer or customers or if sales of any of our products were to materially decrease due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally the supply of our products depends on the uninterrupted efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers and our ability to meet customer service levels many of our manufacturing processes and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers are complex and present difficult technical challenges to obtain the manufacturing yields necessary to operate profitably in addition our manufacturing processes and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers may require complex and specialized equipment which can be expensive to repair or replace with required lead times of up to a year

the manufacturing of certain of our products is concentrated in one or more of our plants contract manufacturers or other suppliers with limited alternate facilities any event that disrupts or otherwise negatively impacts manufacturing facilities manufacturing systems or equipment or contract manufacturers or other suppliers including work stoppages cyberattacks acts of war fire flooding or other natural disasters could delay or suspend shipments of products or the release of new products or could result in the delivery of inferior products as a result our revenues from the affected products would decline and we could incur losses until such time as we or our contract manufacturers or other suppliers are able to restore production processes or are able to put in place alternative contract manufacturers or other suppliers



we rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain of our commodities and raw materials including sole source suppliers for certain of our raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers must be qualified pursuant to our standards and may also have to be qualified under governmental and industry standards and any other standards of our customers which can require additional investment and time we may be unable to qualify any needed new contract manufacturers or suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships based on a variety of factors we may be unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for our business certain of our suppliers may not meet the standards of our customers or licensors or certain of our key contract manufacturers or suppliers may become insolvent or experience other financial distress if any of these events occurs and we have failed to identify and qualify an alternative vendor then we may be unable to meet our contractual obligations and customer expectations which could damage our reputation and result in lost customers and sales or we may incur higher than expected expenses either of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations  



the principal raw materials and packaging used by us and certain of our suppliers and contract manufacturers include surfactants cleaning agents paper products and resinbased molded components volatility and increases in the price of raw materials or increases in the costs of energy shipping and other necessary services could significantly affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution historically we have attempted to address such price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of our products entering into prebuying or lockedin pricing arrangements with certain suppliers and entering into hedge agreements there is no assurance however that we will be able to fully offset any price increases especially given the competitive environment 

 

in addition volatility in certain commodity markets could significantly affect our production cost and therefore harm our financial condition and operating results  

from time to time we use hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of commodities and diesel fuel prices the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to product costs enabling us to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in prices over the term of the contract however in periods of declining fuel prices the hedge agreements can have the effect of locking us in at abovemarket prices  



we distribute our products and receive raw materials and packaging components primarily by truck rail and ship and through various ports of entry reduced availability of trucking rail or shipping capacity due to adverse weather conditions allocation of assets to other industries or geographies or otherwise work stoppages strikes or shutdowns of ports of entry or such transportation sources could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials or packaging components in a timely manner which could disrupt our operations strain our customer relationships and competitive position and adversely affect our operating profits in particular the recent reduced trucking capacity due to a shortage of drivers the recent enforcement deadline for a federal regulation requiring drivers to electronically log their driving hours and adverse weather conditions among other reasons caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and many other companies



our financial success is directly dependent on the reputation and success of our brands particularly the arm  hammer batiste first response nair orajel oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion spinbrush waterpik and xtra brands the effectiveness of these brands could suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further our results could be adversely affected if one or more of our leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived sustainability quality or safety issues including as a result of among other things a significant product recall productrelated litigation defects or impurities in our products product misuse changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or allegations of product tampering in addition as our sales on various ecommerce platforms grow we may be unable to prevent sales of counterfeit pirated or stolen goods unlawful or unethical sales or sales in violation of our policies to the extent any of this occurs it could result in customers delisting our products and damage to our reputation and business  

additionally claims made in our marketing campaigns may become subject to litigation alleging false advertising which if successful could cause us to alter our marketing plans and may materially and adversely affect sales or result in the imposition of significant damages against us or other customer or consumer dissatisfaction especially if such dissatisfaction were to be broadly disseminated including through the use of social media 

 

widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility and speed of dissemination of information negative or inaccurate posting or comments about us in the media or on any social networking website whether accurate or inaccurate or the disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information through social media could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands in addition given the association of our individual products with us an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products or us as a whole thereby potentially adversely impacting our financial results 



from time to time we are subject to product liability claims we may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by our products including losses or injuries caused by raw materials or other components provided by third party suppliers that are included in our products claims could be based on allegations that among other things our products contain contaminants are improperly labeled or designed or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances whether or not successful product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm our sales and operating results and the reputation of our brands in addition if one of our products is found to be defective or noncompliant with applicable rules or regulations we could be required to withdraw or recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability and product recall insurance coverage potential product liability claims and withdrawal and recall costs may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition  

 



we must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations it is possible that we could become subject to other environmental remediation costs and liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition



as climate change ingredients packaging and other sustainability concerns become more prevalent federal state and local governments and our customers consumers and investors are increasingly sensitive to these issues this increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations and customer and investor requirements that could negatively affect us this could cause us to incur additional direct costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with any new regulations and customer requirements or to meet the demands of our investors we could also lose revenue if our consumers change brands or our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements additionally environmentallyconscious investors may choose not to invest in our common stock if we do not comply with their demands for sustainable business practices these costs changes potential loss of revenue and potential reputational harm could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity cash flows and share price



 

we in the ordinary course of our business are and from time to time may become the subject of or party to various pending or threatened legal actions government investigations and proceedings including without limitation those relating to commercial transactions product liability purported consumer class actions employment matters antitrust environmental health safety and other compliancerelated matters such proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of certain pending or threatened legal actions may not be reasonably predictable and any related damages may not be estimable certain pending or future legal actions could result in an adverse outcome for us and any such adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 



the manufacturing processing formulation including stability packaging labeling marketing distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the ftc the epa and the cpsc in addition our and our suppliers’ operations are subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold  

in particular the fda regulates the formulation safety manufacturing packaging labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits battery operated toothbrushes overthecounter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements including vitamins and minerals the fda also exercises oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of our other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that we and our suppliers use to manufacture regulated products and may identify compliance issues that would require us and our suppliers to make certain changes in our manufacturing facilities and processes the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to regulatory action against the products made in that facility including seizure injunction or recall as well as to possible action against the owner of the facilitymanufacturer we may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until the compliance issue has been remediated as a result our business could be adversely affected  

likewise any future determination by the fda or a similar foreign agency or by us in reviewing our compliance with applicable rules and regulations that our products or quality systems do not comply with applicable regulations could result in future compliance activities including product withdrawals or recalls import detentions injunctions preventing the shipment of products or other enforcement actions for example the fda may determine that a particular claim that we use to support the marketing of a product is not substantiated may not accept the evidence of safety for a new product that we may wish to market may challenge the safety or 

 

effectiveness of existing products based on among other things changes in formulations inadequate stability or “shelflife” consumer complaints or improper labeling and may determine that our dietary supplement business manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations do not comply with cgmps similarly we may identify these or other issues in internal compliance r eviews of our operations and the operations and products of vendors and acquired companies these other issues may include the identification of contaminants or noncompliant levels of particular ingredients any of the foregoing could subject us to adve rse publicity force us to incur unanticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations    additionally delays in the acceptance review and approval of products by the fda or other required g overnmental approvals may result from government shutdowns due to the failure by congress to enact regular appropriations 

from time to time congress the fda the ftc the commission or other federal state local or foreign legislative and regulatory authorities may impose additional laws or regulations that apply to us repeal laws or regulations that we consider favorable or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations for example we are subject to regulations regarding the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment as well as the commission’s rules with respect to “conflict minerals” additionally recent reform proposals have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries in addition to the major changes to us tax law signed into law in 2017 major developments in trade relations could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations we are not able to predict the nature of these changes or of such future laws regulations repeals or interpretations or to predict the effect additional or shifting governmental regulation when and if it occurs would have on our business in the future such developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated additional recordkeeping requirements increased documentation of the properties of certain products additional or different labeling additional scientific substantiation expanded adverse event reporting or other new requirements any such developments could increase our costs significantly and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

in addition we collect use and store personal data of our employees customers and other third parties in the ordinary course of business and we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy and security laws and regulations that apply to the collection storage use transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer data including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries in particular the european union eu has adopted strict data privacy regulations following recent developments such as the passage of the eu’s general data protection regulation eu 2016679 “gdpr” in may 2018 and the longawaited regulation on privacy and electronic communications the “eprivacy regulation” which is slated to be finalized in 2019 and will replace the current eprivacy directive 200258ec data privacy and security compliance in the eu are increasingly complex and challenging the gdpr in particular has broad extraterritorial effect and imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with significant penalties for noncompliance up to 4 of worldwide annual turnover or €20 million whichever is higher it is also important to note that many countries are following the eu in producing a broad omnibus law in relation to privacy protection for instance brazil has just published a gdprlike law in general the gdpr and eprivacy regulation and other local privacy laws could also require adaptation of our technologies or practices to satisfy local privacy requirements and standards we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines penalties or orders to cease delay or modify collection use or transfers of personal data we could also face rights requests complaints claims actions or class actions from those persons whose data we collect use and store any of these events or other circumstances related to our collection use and transfer of personal data could also lead to negative media attention cause a loss of reputation in the market or otherwise adversely affect our business



our international operations subject us to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 















 













in addition changes as result of the united kingdom’s decision and subsequent negotiations to exit the eu could subject us to heightened risks in that region including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods services and people to and from the united kingdom increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and additional legal and economic uncertainty additional costs have been incurred in 2018 because of measures implemented to address or mitigate risks there is a risk that the exit will cause an untenable rise in the cost of doing business in the uk moreover in all foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions the recent imposition of tariffs on products imported from certain countries has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries major developments in trade relations including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the us andor other countries and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which in turn could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations all the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to commercialize our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 



our ability to continue to grow our sales and profits is dependent on expanding in the locations in which we already do business and entering into new geographic locations both of which would require significant resources and investments which would affect our risk profile the failure to successfully enter into or expand our business in such locations could materially affect the growth of our business sales and results of operations



we seek to acquire or invest in businesses that offer products services or technologies that are complementary we have made numerous acquisitions in the past 15 years  

we may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future those acquisitions may be significantly larger than the ones completed in the past and may require the company to increase its levels of debt potentially resulting in the company being assigned a lower credit rating however we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive valuations obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions in recent periods competition from other consumer products companies that are seeking similar opportunities has been particularly strong and valuations for potential acquisition assets have been high which has placed pressure on our ability to identify structure and execute transactions in addition all acquisitions and investments entail various risks including the difficulty of entering new markets or product categories the challenges of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the ongoing business of the acquired company the need to review and if necessary upgrade processes of the acquired company to conform to our own processes and applicable legal and regulatory requirements and generally our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment any of these risks may divert management and other resources require us to incur unanticipated costs or delay the anticipated positive impact on our business and results of the acquisition the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent we acquire businesses that have standalone operations that cannot easily be integrated or operations or sources of supply outside of the us and canada for which products are manufactured locally by third parties these factors could harm our financial condition and operating results  larger acquisitions such as our acquisition of the waterpik business in 2017 may require us to significantly increase our levels of debt 

acquired companies or operations or newlycreated ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made in addition future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the potentially dilutive issuances of new equity by us or the incurrence of additional debt or contingent liabilities all of 

 

which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and resources from other matters that are critical to our operations  



as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 2107 million of total consolidated indebtedness net of debt issuance costs this amount of indebtedness could have important consequences including













additionally our credit facility is subject to certain financial and other customary covenants  in the event of a breach of those covenants our lenders under the credit facility may be entitled to accelerate the related debt and any lenders in respect of any other debt to which a crossdefault provision applies may be entitled to accelerate such other debt and we could be required to seek amendments or waivers under the debt instruments or to refinance the debt

moreover we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes for example we substantially increased our indebtedness in order to finance the acquisition of the waterpik business in 2017 if additional new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify a substantial increase in our indebtedness could also have a negative impact on our credit rating  in this regard failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate available to us in future financings as well as our liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets any decision regarding future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time including market conditions and our credit rating  



our ability to repay and refinance our indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends primarily on our cash flow cash flow is often subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control and such factors may limit our ability to repay indebtedness and fund capital expenditures a failure to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition  



we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to conduct our business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to internal communications and communications with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers billing customers and receiving and applying payment processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements collecting and storing customer consumer employee investor and other stakeholder information and personal data and other processes necessary to manage our business 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including ransomware denial of service and phishing attacks and advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems networks and services and those of our customers and other business partners as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and the data of our customers and other business partners as a result our information technology systems networks or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or we could suffer a loss or disclosure of business 

 

person al or stakeholder information due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages and security breaches although we ha ve business continuity plans in place and ha ve implemented a breach response plan to address service interruption s if these plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct our operations which may adversely affect our business in addition if our service providers suppliers or customers experience a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders or other business operations which would adversely affect our busin ess 

our information technology systems and our thirdparty providers’ systems have been and will likely continue to be subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes ransomware unauthorized access attempts denial of service attacks phishing social engineering hacking and other cyberattacks such attacks may originate from nation states or attempts by outside parties hackers criminal organizations or other threat actors to date we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks however we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers’ databases or systems in addition although we have policies and procedures in place governing the secure storage of personal information collected by us or our thirdparty service providers data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct may occur in the future 

 

although we are currently implementing enterprisewide upgrades to our systems and will continue to monitor and upgrade systems as appropriate legacy systems may be vulnerable to increased risk additionally if a new system does not function properly it could affect our ability to order supplies process and deliver customer orders and process and receive payments for our products this could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows moreover because the techniques tools and tactics used in cyberattacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack as such we may need to expend additional resources in the future to continue to protect against or address problems caused by any business interruptions or data security breaches



although the board authorized new share repurchase programs in each of 2016 and 2017 and recently increased the amount of the quarterly cash dividends payable on our common stock any board determinations to continue to repurchase our common stock or to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock in each case at levels consistent with recent practice or at all will be based primarily upon our financial condition results of operations business requirements price of our common stock in the case of the repurchase programs our ability to access debt capital markets or other sources of financing and the board’s continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event we do not declare a quarterly dividend or discontinue our share repurchases our stock price could be adversely affected  



over the years the banking system and financial markets have experienced severe disruption including among other things bank failures and consolidations severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades declines in asset valuations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these conditions present the following risks to us among others

we are dependent on the continued viability of the financial institutions that participate in the syndicate that is generally obligated to fund our 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility dated march 29 2018 as amended the “credit agreement” in addition the credit agreement includes a “commitment increase” feature that enables us to increase the amount of our borrowing under the credit agreement subject to lending commitments and certain conditions any disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 

our short and longterm credit ratings affect our borrowing costs and access to financing a downgrade in our credit ratings as a result of a substantial increase in our indebtedness or otherwise would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit market also could raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings either scenario could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets

 

although we believe that our operating cash flows together with our access to the credit markets pro vides us with significant discretionary funding capacity the inability of one or more institutions to fulfill funding obligations under the credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations  



approximately 18 of our net sales in 2018 were to customers outside the us we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk both transaction and translation with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar outside of the us sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the canadian dollar euro pound brazilian real mexican peso and australian dollar among others a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we purchase materials and services in foreign markets although we from time to time enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed sales or purchases denominated in the us dollar canadian dollar pound euro mexican peso and australian dollar foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 



our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized if the actual amount of our future taxable income is less than the amount we are currently projecting with respect to specific tax jurisdictions or if there is a change in the time period within which the deferred tax asset becomes deductible we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets the recording of a valuation allowance would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on our operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances which would have either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate    major developments in tax policy or trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and liquidity 



on december 22 2017 the president signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act which significantly changed the code including a reduction in the statutory corporate income tax rate to 21 a new limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense restrictions on the use of net operating loss carryforwards arising in taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and changes to the taxation of income earned from foreign sources and foreign subsidiaries including requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the tax cuts and jobs act also authorizes the treasury department to issue regulations with respect to the new provisions we cannot predict how the changes in the tax cuts and jobs act regulations other guidance issued under it or conforming or nonconforming state tax rules might affect us or our business in addition there can be no assurance that us tax laws including the corporate income tax rate would not undergo significant changes in the near future



significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we provide for uncertain tax positions with respect to tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards mandated by applicable accounting guidance fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results we are regularly under audit by tax authorities and although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution  additionally adverse outcomes from tax audits that we may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

 



the market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and brand names including arm  hammer batiste first response nair orajel oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion spinbrush waterpik and xtra we own the material trademarks and brand names used in connection with the marketing and distribution of our major products both in the us and in other countries in addition we hold several valuable patents on our products which we believe serve as an effective barrier to entry for new competitors accordingly we rely on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights although most of our material intellectual property is registered in the us and in certain foreign countries in which we operate we cannot be sure that our intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or if necessary successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future and we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties infringe our intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with our brands and harm our sales our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition also our patents are granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed we do not consider any single patent to be material to the business as a whole  

in addition if our products are found to infringe intellectual property rights of others the owners of those rights could bring legal actions against us claiming substantial damages for past infringement and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products if these legal actions are successful in addition to any potential liability for damages from past infringement we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products potentially adding significant costs we might not prevail in any action brought against us or we may be unsuccessful in securing any license for continued use and therefore have to discontinue the marketing and sale of a product this could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition  



we have a material amount of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets as well as other longlived assets which are periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards declines in our profitability andor estimated cash flows related to specific intangible assets as well as potential changes in market valuations for similar assets and market discount rates has resulted in impairment charges from time to time and may result in future impairment charges which could reduce our net income and otherwise have an adverse impact on operating results 



our operations as well as the operations of our thirdparty manufacturers suppliers and customers may be subject to disruption from a variety of causes including material shortages financial difficulties work stoppages cyberattacks demonstrations disease outbreaks or pandemics acts of war terrorism fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters disruptions in logistics loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites supplier capacity constraints raw material and product quality or safety issues industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues additionally as certain of our businesses grow at unanticipated levels we may be required to add capacity requiring substantial and unanticipated capital expenditures if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  



our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations this effect could be exacerbated if any officers or other key personnel left as a group or at the same time our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future  factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of key employees include employee morale our reputation competition from other employers and the availability of qualified personnel in a tightening labor market 

 



our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless the corporation otherwise determines the court of chancery of the state of delaware or solely to the extent that the court of chancery of the state of delaware does not have jurisdiction a state court of the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors officers or other employees or stockholders to either us or our stockholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers alternatively if a court outside of delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements

overview

our business

we develop manufacture and market a broad range of consumer household and personal care and specialty products focused on animal productivity chemicals and cleaners we focus our consumer products marketing efforts principally on our 11 “power brands” these wellrecognized brand names include arm  hammer used in multiple product categories such as baking soda cat litter carpet deodorization and laundry detergent trojan condoms lubricants and vibrators oxiclean stain removers cleaning solutions laundry detergent and bleach alternatives spinbrush batteryoperated and manual toothbrushes first response home pregnancy and ovulation test kits nair depilatories orajel oral analgesic xtra laundry detergent l’il critters and vitafusion gummy dietary supplements batiste dry shampoos and waterpik water flossers and replacement showerheads

we sell our consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets mass merchandisers wholesale clubs drugstores convenience stores home stores dollar pet and other specialty stores and websites and other ecommerce channels all of which sell the products to consumers we sell our specialty products to industrial customers livestock producers and through distributors

we operate our business in three segments consumer domestic consumer international and spd the segments are based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures in 2018 the consumer domestic consumer international and spd segments represented approximately 76 17 and 7 respectively of our consolidated net sales

2018 financial highlights 

key fiscal year 2018 financial results include













strategic goals challenges and initiatives

our ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for our products and retail customers’ decisions to carry our products which are in part affected by general economic conditions in our markets although our consumer products generally are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products in 2018 many of the product categories in which we operate continued to experience pricing pressures and weak or inconsistent consumer demand some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category in 

church  dwight co inc and subsidiaries

dollars in millions except share and per share data

 

addition an increasing portion of our product categories is being sold by club stores dollar stores  mass merchandisers and in ternetbased retailers  these factors have placed downward pressure on our sales and gross margins 

we expect a competitive marketplace in 2019 due to new product introductions by competitors and continuing competitive pricing pressures in this environment we intend to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives maintain competitive marketing and trade spending tightly control our cost structure continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursue strategic acquisitions we also intend to continue to grow our product sales globally and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products to appeal to a wide range of consumers

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of laundry detergent the continued customer demand for these products are critical to our future success as a result any commercialization delays or reduction of sales of these products in the event that our diversification efforts discussed below are not successful could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition there continues to be significant product competition in the gummy vitamin category the category has grown from eight competitors to 30 in the last five years we continue to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through among other things new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending however there is no assurance that the category will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline 

we are continuously focused on strengthening our key brands such as arm  hammer oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion batiste and waterpik through the launch of innovative new products which span various product categories including premium and value household products supported by increased marketing and trade spending there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 

in the domestic business seven out of 11 “power brands” met or exceeded category growth for the full year 2018 our global product portfolio consists of both premium 65 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2018 and value 35 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2018 brands which we believe enables us to succeed in a range of economic environments we intend to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among costconscious consumers 

over the past two decades we have diversified from an almost exclusively us business to a global company with approximately 18 of sales derived from foreign countries in 2018 we have operations in seven countries canada mexico uk france germany australia and brazil and export to over 130 other countries in 2018 we benefited from our expanded global footprint and expect to continue to focus on selectively expanding our global business if we are unable to expand our business internationally at the rate that we expect we may not realize the operational benefits that we anticipate 

although we believe ongoing international expansion represents a significant opportunity to grow our business our increasing activity in global markets exposes us to additional complexity and uncertainty net sales generated outside of the us are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as political uncertainty which could impact future operating results moreover the current domestic and international political environment including existing and potential changes to us policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty regarding the global economy the impact of us tariffs primarily on waterpik products was a component of increased cost of sale during the year ended december 31 2018 the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we manufacture or sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition

we also continue to focus on controlling our costs historically we have been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent by passing along some of these cost increases to customers we have also entered into set pricing and prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel to combat higher input costs and tariffs in 2018 we announced price increases on approximately 30 of our portfolio should additional price increases be warranted we cannot be certain they will be accepted by our customers additionally maintaining tight controls on overhead costs has been a hallmark of ours and has enabled us to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions 

the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of our overall strategy and product category diversification acquisitions have added significantly to our sales and profits and product category diversification over the last decade this is recently evidenced by our 2015 acquisition of certain assets of varied industries corporation the “vicor acquisition” 2016 acquisitions of spencer forrest inc the maker of toppik the “toppik acquisition” and the anusol and rectinol businesses from johnson  johnson the “anusol acquisition” and 2017 acquisitions of viviscal from lifes2good holdings limited the “viviscal acquisition” agro biosciences inc the “agro acquisition” waterpik from pik holdings inc the “waterpik acquisition” and 2018 acquisition of passport food safety solutions inc the “passport acquisition”  however the failure to effectively integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause us to incur material asset writedowns we actively seek acquisitions that fit our guidelines and our strong financial position provides us with

dollars in millions except share and per share data

 

flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in addition our ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled us to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions since 2001 we ha ve acquired 10 of our 11 “power brands”   

we believe we are positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to our strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives maintaining competitive marketing and trade spending managing our cost structure continuing to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursuing strategic acquisitions this focus together with the strength of our portfolio of premium and value brands has enabled us to succeed in a range of economic environments  and is expected to position us to continue to increase stockholder value over the longterm moreover the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations as a result of net income and effective working capital management combined with an investment grade credit rating provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions drive new product development make capital expenditures to support organic growth and gross margin improvements return cash to stockholders through dividends and share buy backs and reduce outstanding debt positioning us to continue to create stockholder value

critical accoun ting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty they are based on our historical experience our observation of trends in industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate our significant accounting policies and estimates are described below 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves

virtually all of our revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by our customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for our products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements and coupons are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold we rely on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example we use historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements a difference of approximately 31 in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns we use experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if our estimates for promotional activities and sales returns reserves were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 64 while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations reserve adjustments made in 2018 2017 and 2016 are immaterial relative to the amount of trade promotion expense incurred annually by us 

impairment of goodwill trade names and other intangible assets 

carrying values of goodwill and indefinitelived tradenames are reviewed periodically for possible impairment  finite intangible assets are assessed when there are business triggering events our impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trade names and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired the result of our annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units in addition there were no goodwill impairment charges for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2018

 

fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” or “excess earnings” discounted cash flow method which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change and therefore could impact fair values in the future we determined that the fair value of all other intangible assets for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2018 exceeded their respective carrying values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability in 2017 there was a personal care trade name that based on recent performance had experienced sales and profit declines that had eroded a significant portion of the excess between fair and carrying value which could potentially result in an impairment of the asset in 2017 this excess had been reduced due in large part to an increased competitive market environment therefore resulting in reduced cash flow projections the performance of the tradename improved in 2018 thereby increasing the excess between fair value and carrying value this indefinitelived intangible asset could still be susceptible to impairment risk  while management can and has implemented strategies to address the risk significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of this asset

it is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if for example i the businesses or brands do not perform as projected ii ove rall economic conditions in 2018 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the mar ketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible as sets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

income taxes

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized we record liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under us gaap guidelines the liabilities relate to tax return positions that although supportable by us may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement we adjust this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change in this regard settlement of any issue or an adverse determination in litigation with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate conversely favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate

specialty products division 

our spd segment focuses on sales to businesses and participates in three product areas animal productivity specialty chemicals and specialty cleaners and accounted for approximately 8 of our consolidated net sales in 2017   

animal productivity products 

since the arm  hammer animal productivity business began in 1972 with its launch of arm  hammer baking soda as a feed additive to help dairy cows produce more milk we have built a leading portfolio of nutritional supplements designed to help improve the health and productivity of dairy cows today our portfolio of dairy nutritional supplements includes brands such as megalac rumen bypass fat licensed from volac international limited – a supplement made from natural oils – which enables cows to maintain energy levels during the period of high milk production resulting in improved milk yields in addition we market a line of high quality protein and amino acid products including biochlor and fermenten which are designed to help reduce health issues associated with calving as well as provide needed protein to ensure proper growth and milk production

specialty chemicals

our specialty chemicals business primarily encompasses the manufacture marketing and sale of sodium bicarbonate in a range of grades and granulations for use in industrial markets in industrial markets sodium bicarbonate is used by other manufacturing companies as a leavening agent for commercial baked goods as an antacid in pharmaceuticals as a carbon dioxide release agent in fire extinguishers as an alkaline agent in swimming pool chemicals and as a buffer in kidney dialysis

competition

we compete in the household and personal care consumer product categories which are highly innovative categories characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and require significant advertising and promotion we compete in these categories primarily on the basis of product innovation and performance brand recognition price value and other consumer benefits consumer products particularly laundry and dietary supplements are subject to significant price competition as a result we from time to time may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share product introductions typically involve heavy marketing and trade spending in the year of launch and we usually are 

 

not able to determine whether th e new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product line 

because of the competitive environment facing retailers we face pricing pressure from customers particularly highvolume retailer store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms these concessions or terms could reduce our margins furthermore if we are unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to our customers they could increase product purchases from competitors and reduce purchases from us which would harm our sales and profitability

our competitors in the consumer domestic and consumer international segments include pg the clorox company colgatepalmolive company sc johnson  son inc nestle purina petcare company henkel reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson ansell limited pfizer inc bayer ag alere inc nbty inc and pharmavite llc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and have the capacity to outspend us in their attempts to gain market share

competition within our specialty chemicals and animal productivity product lines is intense the specialty chemicals business operates in a competitive environment influenced by capacity utilization customers ’ leverage and the impact of raw material and energy costs product introductions typically involve introductory educational costs in the year of launch and we usually are not able to determine whether new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of new products or the extension of the product lines our key competitors with respect to our spd segment are archer daniel midland co diamond v lallemand inc solvay chemicals inc genesis alkali and natural soda inc

distribution of our products

our consumer domestic and consumer international segments products are marketed primarily through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets mass merchandisers wholesale clubs pharmacies and drugstores convenience stores home stores dollar and other discount stores pet and other specialty stores and websites and other ecommerce channels all of which sell our products to consumers the consumer domestic segment employs a sales force based regionally throughout the us and utilizes the services of independent food brokers who represent our products in the food mass pet dollar and club as well as numerous other classes of trade our consumer international distribution network is wellestablished and varies according to the needs of each market our subsidiaries in certain countries primarily utilize internal warehousing and distribution capabilities that enable direct shipment to key retailers our products are stored in our plants and thirdparty owned warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking companies or picked up by customers at our facilities 

spd markets sodium bicarbonate and other chemicals to industrial and agricultural customers primarily throughout the us and canada distribution is accomplished through a dedicated sales force supplemented by manufacturers ’ representatives and independent distributors our products in this segment are stored in our plants and public warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking companies or picked up by customers at our facilities

geographic areas

approximately 83 84 and 83 of our consolidated net sales in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively were to customers in the us approximately 95 98 and 96 of our longlived assets were located in the us at december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively other than the us no one country accounts for more than 5 of consolidated net sales or 5 of total assets 

seasonality

 

our business is generally not seasonal although the consumer domestic and consumer international segments are affected by sales of spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrushes which typically are higher during the fall in advance of the holiday season sales of nair depilatories and waxes which typically are higher in the spring and summer months and sales of vitafusion and l ’ il critters dietary supplements which typically are slightly higher in the fourth quarter of each year in advance of the cold and flu season and renewed commitments to health

raw materials and sources of supply

we manufacture sodium bicarbonate for our consumer and specialty products businesses at our plants located at green river wyoming and old fort ohio the primary source of soda ash a basic raw material used in the production of sodium bicarbonate is the mineral trona which is found in abundance in southwestern wyoming near our green river plant we have adequate trona reserves under mineral leases to support our sodium bicarbonate requirements for the foreseeable future 

 

we are a party to a partnership agreement with tata chemicals soda ash partners which mines and processes trona reserves in wyoming through the partnership and related supply and services agreements we fulfill a substantial amount of our soda ash requirements enabling us to achieve some of the economies of an integrated business capable of producing sodium bicarbonate and related products from the basic raw material we also have an agreement for the supply of soda ash from another co mpany the partnership agreement and other supply agreements between the tata chemicals soda ash partners and us are terminable upon two years notice by either of us we believe that sufficient alternative sources of soda ash supply are available 

we believe that ample sources of raw materials are available for all of our other major products detergent chemicals are used in a variety of our products and are available from a number of sources bottles paper products and clay are available from multiple suppliers although we choose to source most of these materials from single sources under longterm supply agreements in order to gain favorable economies of scale we also use a palm oil fraction byproduct in a number of products including our rumen bypass fats products alternative sources of supply are available in case of the disruption or termination of the supply agreements

the cost of raw materials including surfactants diesel fuel and oil based raw and packaging materials used primarily in our consumer businesses were higher in 2017 relative to 2016 increasing our core commodity costs increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact our costs and financial results if we are unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to our customers

we utilize the services of third party contract manufacturers around the world for certain products 

patents and trademarks

our trademarks appear in upper case letters throughout this annual report the majority of our trademarks are registered with either the us patent and trademark office or with the trademark offices of many foreign countries the arm  hammer trademark has been used by us since 1867 and is a valuable asset and important to the successful operation of our business our products are sold under many other valuable trademarks held by the company including trojan nair orajel waterpik first response xtra oxiclean spinbrush batiste simply saline l ’ il critters and vitafusion our portfolio of trademarks represents substantial goodwill in the businesses using the trademarks

us patents are currently granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed although we actively seek and maintain a number of patents no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole 

customers and order backlog 

in each of the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 net sales to our largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates  “ walmart ”  were 24 24 and 24 respectively of our consolidated net sales no other customer accounted for 10 or more of consolidated net sales in the threeyear period the time between receipt of orders and shipment is generally short and as a result backlog is not significant 

research  development 

we conduct research and development activities primarily at our princeton facility in new jersey we devote significant resources and attention to product development process technology and basic research to develop differentiated products with new and distinctive features and to provide increased convenience and value to our customers to increase our innovative capabilities we engage outside contractors for general research and development in activities beyond our core areas of expertise we spent 708 million 632 million and 647 million on research and development activities in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively

government regulation

general

some of our products are subject to regulation by one or more us agencies including the us food and drug administration  “ fda ”  the environmental protection agency  “ epa ”  the federal trade commission  “ ftc ”  the consumer product safety commission  “ cpsc ”  and foreign agencies 

fda regulations govern a variety of matters relating to our products such as product development manufacturing premarket clearance or approval advertising and distribution the regulations adopted and standards imposed by the fda and similar foreign agencies evolve over time and can require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes and quality systems to remain in 

 

compliance these agenci es periodically inspect manufacturing and other facilities if we fail to comply with applicable regulations and standards we may be subject to sanctions including fines and penalties the recall of products and cessation of manufacturing andor distribu tion 

in addition we sell products that are subject to regulation under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act and the toxic substances control act both of which are administered by the epa 

we are also subject to regulation by the ftc in connection with the content and truthfulness of our labeling advertising promotion trade practices and other matters the ftc has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of otherwise false or misleading advertising claims these enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties andor restitution by the companies involved such actions can result in substantial financial penalties and significantly restrict the marketing of a dietary supplement

the cpsc administers the poison prevention packaging act and has issued regulations requiring special child resistant packaging for certain products including pharmaceuticals dietary supplements and dietary substances containing certain ingredients eg iron

our relationship with certain union employees may be overseen by the national labor relations board our activities also are regulated by various agencies of the countries states provinces and other localities in which we sell our products 

medical device clearance and approval 

to be commercially distributed in the us a medical device must unless exempt receive clearance or approval from the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act  “ fdca ”  for lower risk class ii devices we must generally submit a premarket notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution known as a “ 510k ” clearance our condoms lubricants contact lens solution wound wash and home pregnancy test kits are regulated as class ii devices some other low risk devices including spinbrush and other battery powered toothbrushes are in class i and are generally exempted from the 510k requirement to obtain 510k clearance a device must be determined to be substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a benchmark device or “ predicate ” that is already legally in commercial distribution any modification to a 510k cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a change in its intended use generally requires a new 510k clearance we may determine that a new 510k clearance is not required but if the fda disagrees it may retroactively require a 510k clearance and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified device until 510k clearance is obtained 

medical device postmarket regulation

after a medical device is commercialized numerous regulatory requirements apply including 



otc pharmaceutical

we market overthecounter  “ otc ”  pharmaceutical products such as toothpaste antiperspirant and oral analgesics products that are also subject to fda and foreign regulation under the us otc monograph system selected otc pharmaceutical products are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the submission and approval of a new drug application the fda otc monographs include wellknown ingredients and specify requirements for permitted indications required warnings and precautions allowable combinations of ingredients and dosage levels pharmaceutical products marketed under the otc monograph system must conform to specific quality formula and labeling requirements

 

all facilities where otc pharmaceutical products are manufactured tested packaged stored or distributed must comply with cgmp regulations andor regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries where the facilities are located all of o ur pharmaceutical products are manufactured tested packaged stored and distributed according to cgmp regulations the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that our facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representations made to customers or to regulatory action against us related to the products made in that facility such as seizure injunction or recall serious product quality concerns could also resu lt in governmental actions against us that among other things could result in the suspension of production or distribution of o ur products product seizures loss of certain licenses or other governmental penalties and could have a material adverse effe ct on our financial condition or operating results w e are required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of our otc pharmaceutical products marketed in the us 

we cannot predict whether new legislation regulating our activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on our business

food products

we market baking soda and animal feed products such as rumen fermentation enhancers and dietary cationanion difference  “ dcad ”  balancers that are also subject to fda and foreign regulation the food safety modernization act  “ fsma ”  regulates food and animal feed products and mandates preventive controls including hazard analysis risk controls supplier qualifications and controls and increased record keeping fsma grants the fda the authority to require mandatory recalls for products under certain conditions the fda is currently in the process of establishing rules and guidance to implement the provisions of fsma the potential impact of these rules and applicable guidance cannot be determined now

dietary supplements

the processing formulation safety manufacturing packaging labeling advertising distribution importing selling and storing of dietary supplements are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies including the fda the ftc the cpsc the epa and by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold the fdca governs the composition safety labeling manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements 

dietary ingredients that were not marketed in the us before october 15 1994 must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the fda at least 75 days before the initial marketing unless the ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for food without being chemically altered the notification must provide evidence of a history of use or other evidence establishing that use of the dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe the fda may determine that notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a new ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe which could effectively prevent the marketing of the ingredient on july 5 2011 the fda issued draft guidance governing notification of new dietary ingredients for public comment and not for implementation the fda has not taken any further steps to implement the guidance which if implemented could effectively change the status of dietary ingredients that the industry has marketed as “ old ” dietary ingredients to “ new ” dietary ingredients that may require submission of a new dietary ingredient notification 

a company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess information substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading if the fda determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim or if the fda determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific evidence or is otherwise false or misleading the claim could not be used and any product bearing the claim could be subject to regulatory action

the fda ’ s cgmp regulations govern the manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers as with otc products the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that our dietary supplement facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representation made to consumers or to regulatory action against us related to the products made in that facility seizure injunction or recall there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the fda ’ s interpretation and implementation of the cgmp regulations the failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cgmp regulations may render products manufactured in that facility adulterated and subjects those products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential fda enforcement actions the manufacturer packer or distributor of a dietary supplement marketed in the us whose name appears on the label of the supplement is required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of that supplement to the fda 

additional legislation may be introduced which if passed would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements the effect of additional domestic or international governmental legislation regulations or administrative orders if and 

 

when promulgated cannot be determined new legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards and require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations relating to environmental concerns including air emissions wastewater discharges solid and hazardous waste management activities and the safety of our employees we endeavor to take actions necessary to comply with such regulations these steps include periodic environmental and health and safety audits of our facilities the audits conducted by independent firms with expertise in environmental health and safety compliance include site visits at each location as well as a review of documentary information to determine compliance with such federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations

unfavorable and uncertain economic conditions have adversely affected and in the future may adversely affect demand for some of the categories of products we sell resulting in reduced sales volume or market share or a shift in its product mix from higher margin to lower margin products factors that can affect demand include competitors’ products advertising and pricing actions rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs including increased costs as a result of changes in federal regulations significant shifts in government policies commodity costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior including delays in the timing of tax refunds from the federal government gasoline and home heating oil pricing reduced unemployment benefits in periods of high unemployment and changes in tax policies while the vast majority of our products are consumer staples that generally are less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products they may become subject to increasing price competition additionally some of our products such as laundry additives gummy dietary supplements and batteryoperated toothbrushes are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of our customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs home stores and dollar pet and other specialty stores have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all we regularly review the financial strength of our key customers and where appropriate modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales because the same economic conditions that affect us also affect many of our suppliers we regularly conduct a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations when appropriate we identify alternate sources of materials and services to date we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers however a protracted economic downturn that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our sales and results of operations  

 



we face intense competition from consumer products companies both in the us and in international markets most of our products compete with other widelyadvertised brands within each product category and from retailers including club stores grocery stores dollar stores mass merchandisers ecommerce retailers and subscription services which are increasingly offering private label brands and generic nonbranded products of our customers in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices 

our products generally compete on the basis of performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers consumer products are subject to significant price competition as a result we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase prices by an amount that does not cover manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices or inability to raise prices sufficiently to cover manufacturing cost increases would harm profit margins in addition if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins our sales growth and other results of operations would suffer  

advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on retail customer decisions regarding the brands and product lines they sell and on consumer purchasing decisions a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if our advertising marketing and promotional programs are not effective our sales growth may decline  

many of our competitors are large companies including pg the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson nestle purina petcare company ansell limited alere inc pfizer inc bayer ag sc johnson  son inc pharmavite llc and nbty inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and therefore have the capacity to outspend us on advertising and promotional activities and introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can in addition our competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by us competitive activity may require us to increase our spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced profits and adversely affect growth if we lose market share or the markets in which we compete do not grow substantially our sales growth will decline  

there continues to be significant product and price competition in the premium and deep value laundry detergent categories and more recently product competition in the gummy vitamin category for example in the laundry detergent category pg and henkel the two largest laundry detergent companies in the us are engaged in aggressive pricing promotions and retailers are continuing to deemphasize the deep value tier of laundry detergents which is where xtra competes in addition the gummy vitamin category has grown from eight competitors to 30 in the last five years we continue to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through among other things new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending however there is no assurance the categories will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline



a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our net sales walmart is our largest customer accounting for approximately 24 of net sales in 2017 24 of net sales in 2016 and 24 of net sales in 2015 our top three customers accounted for approximately 36 of net sales in 2017 35 of net sales in 2016 and 35 of net sales in 2015 we expect that a significant portion of our net sales will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues as a result changes in the strategies of walmart or any of our other largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or of shelf space they dedicate to private label products could materially harm our net sales and profitability  in addition certain of our product lines are concentrated with certain customers moreover the use of evolving technology by our customers to develop more complex pricing models may lead to category pricing pressures if we were to lose a significant customer due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues this could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover our business is based primarily upon individual sales orders as we rarely enter into longterm contracts with our customers and most customer agreements include customer termination rights after short notice accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from us at any time and for any reason if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

 



in recent years retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally has increased this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailer customers who may demand lower pricing special packaging or impose other requirements on us these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship some of our customers particularly our highvolume retail store customers have sought to obtain pricing and other concessions and better trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms to those customers our margins are reduced further if we are unable to effectively respond to the demands of our customers these customers could reduce their purchases of our products and increase their purchases of products from competitors which would harm our sales and profitability in addition reductions in inventory by our customers including as a result of consolidations in the retail industry or these customers managing their working capital requirements could result in reduced orders for our products and adversely affect our results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions  

protracted unfavorable market conditions have caused many of our customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell and reduce or discontinue certain of our product lines particularly those products that were not number one or two in their category if this continues to occur and we are unable to improve distribution for those products at other customers our results could be adversely affected  

in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains are typically sold at lower prices than branded products as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending our customers have discontinued or reduced distribution of some of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase the customers’ less expensive and in some cases more profitable private label products primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories to the extent customers discontinue or reduce distribution of our products or these products are adversely affected by customers’ actions to increase shelf space for their private label products we would seek to improve distribution with other customers however if our efforts are not effective our sales growth and other results as well as our market share could be adversely affected 



our performance depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and the financial difficulties of our retailer customers consumer products such as those marketed by us are increasingly being sold by club stores dollar stores mass merchandisers and internetbased retailers sales of our products remain strongest in the traditional mass merchandiser food and drug retail stores and our products are also being sold in club stores and dollar stores channels additionally certain consumer products are now offered through internetbased subscription services or buying clubs although we have taken steps to improve and have seen improvement in sales to club stores dollar stores and internetbased retailers and are engaged in ecommerce with respect to our toppik viviscal and waterpik brands if the current trend continues and we are not successful in further improving sales to these channels our financial condition and operating results could suffer  in addition the growth of the alternative retail channels that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly private label products may reduce our ability to market and sell our products through such retailers the retail environment is changing with the growth of alternative retail channels and this could significantly change the way traditional retailers do business if these alternative retail channels were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers andor we are not successful in these alternative retail channels our margins and results of operations may be negatively impacted 



a significant percentage of our revenues come from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during 2017 approximately 83 of our sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes dietary supplements antiperspirants and deodorants our ability to achieve unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of our products by consumers relative to competitors’ products our ability to drive growth through product innovation in existing and new product categories investment in our established brands and enhanced merchandising and our ability to capture market share from our competitors our ability to quickly innovate in order to adapt our products to meet changing consumer demands is essential especially in light of ecommerce significantly reducing the barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers this risk is further heightened by the continued evolution of consumer needs habits and preferences as a result of shifts in us demographics reflecting various factors including cultural and socioeconomic changes if we are unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that expand our product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products we may not achieve our sales growth objectives even if we are 

 

successful in increasing sales within our product categories a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for our products could have a negative impact on our financial results  



our future performance and growth depends on our ability to successfully identify develop and introduce new products and product line extensions we cannot be certain that we will achieve our innovation goals the successful development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development marketing and promotional expenditures which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which we have limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays competitor actions regulatory approval hurdles and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of existing products our financial performance could be harmed  

each year we introduce new products including launches into new “white space” categories across the majority of our marketed brands historically new product acceptance has generally been widespread across the retailer base there is no assurance however that our customers and consumers will continue to purchase these new products if new products are not successful in generating sales growth our financial results could suffer from time to time we have discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs we may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet retailer or consumer expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand  



from time to time we initiate expansion projects with respect to our facilities as is customary with large construction projects these projects are subject to risks of and we have from time to time experienced delay or cost overruns resulting from numerous factors including the following shortages of equipment materials or skilled labor work stoppages unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment unanticipated cost increases difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions difficulties in meeting regulatory or quality requirements or obtaining regulatory approvals availability of suppliers to certify equipment for existing and enhanced regulations design and engineering problems and failure or delay of third party service providers civil unrest and labor disputes significant cost overruns or delays in completing a project or the miscalculations of our anticipated capacity needs could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment results of operations and cash flows if we were to experience delays or cost overruns in the future it could result in product allocation and retailer frustration the loss of a significant customer or customers or if sales of any of our products were to materially decrease due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally the supply of our products depends on the uninterrupted efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities and ability to meet customer service levels many of our manufacturing processes are complex and present difficult technical challenges to obtain the manufacturing yields necessary to operate profitably in addition our manufacturing processes may require complex and specialized equipment which can be expensive to repair or replace with required lead times of up to a year

the manufacturing of certain of our products is concentrated in one or more of our plants or contract manufacturers with limited alternate facilities any event that negatively impacts manufacturing facilities manufacturing systems or equipment or contract manufacturers or suppliers could delay or suspend shipments of products or the release of new products or could result in the delivery of inferior products our revenues from the affected products would decline and we could incur losses until such time as we or our contract manufacturers are able to restore production processes or are able to put in place alternative contract manufacturers or suppliers



we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain of our commodities and raw materials including sole source suppliers for certain of our raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers have to be qualified pursuant to our standards and may also have to be qualified under governmental and industry standards and any other standards of our customers which can require additional investment and time we may be unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships based on a variety of factors we may be unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for our business certain of our suppliers may not meet the standards of our customers or licensors or certain of our key suppliers may become insolvent or experience other financial distress if any of these events occurs 

 

and we have failed to identify and qualify an alternative vendor then we may be unable to meet our contractual obligations and customer expectations which could damage our reputation and result in lost customers and sales or we may incur higher than expected expenses either of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations and r esults of operations  



the principal raw materials and packaging used by us include surfactants cleaning agents paper products and resinbased molded components volatility and increases in the price of raw materials or increases in the costs of energy shipping and other necessary services could significantly affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution historically we have attempted to address such price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of our products entering into prebuying or lockedin pricing arrangements with certain suppliers and entering into hedge agreements there is no assurance however that we will be able to fully offset any price increases especially given the competitive environment in addition volatility in certain commodity markets could significantly affect our production cost and therefore harm our financial condition and operating results  

from time to time we use hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of commodities and diesel fuel prices the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to product costs enabling us to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in prices over the term of the contract however in periods of declining fuel prices the hedge agreements can have the effect of locking us in at abovemarket prices  



we distribute our products and receive raw materials and packaging components primarily by truck rail and ship and through various ports of entry reduced availability of trucking rail or shipping capacity due to adverse weather conditions allocation of assets to other industries or geographies or otherwise work stoppages strikes or shutdowns of ports of entry or such transportation sources could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials or packaging components in a timely manner which could disrupt our operations strain our customer relationships and competitive position and adversely affect our operating profits



our financial success is directly dependent on the reputation and success of our brands particularly the arm  hammer oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion and waterpik brands the effectiveness of these brands could suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further our results could be adversely affected if one or more of our other leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived sustainability quality or safety issues  

additionally claims made in our marketing campaigns may become subject to litigation alleging false advertising which if successful could cause us to alter our marketing plans and may materially and adversely affect sales or result in the imposition of significant damages against us or other customer or consumer dissatisfaction especially if such dissatisfaction were to be broadly disseminated including through the use of social media 

 

widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination negative or inaccurate posting or comments about us in the media or on any social networking website whether accurate or inaccurate or the disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information through social media could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands in addition given the association of our individual products with us an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products or us as a whole thereby potentially adversely impacting our financial results 



from time to time we are subject to product liability claims we may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by our products including losses or injuries caused by raw materials or other components provided by third party suppliers that are included in our products claims could be based on allegations that among other things our products contain contaminants are improperly labeled or designed or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances whether or not successful product liability claims could result in negative publicity 

 

that could harm our sales and operating results and the reputation of our brands in addition if one of our products is found to be defective or no ncompliant with applicable rules or regulations we could be required to withdraw or recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability and product recall insurance coverage potential prod uct liability claims and withdrawal and recall costs may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition  



we must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations it is possible that we could become subject to other environmental remediation costs and liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition



 

we in the ordinary course of our business are and from time to time may become the subject of or party to various pending or threatened legal actions government investigations and proceedings including without limitation those relating to commercial transactions product liability purported consumer class actions employment matters antitrust environmental health safety and other compliancerelated matters such proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of certain pending or threatened legal actions may not be reasonably predictable and any related damages may not be estimable certain pending or future legal actions for example the matter described under “item 3 legal proceedings  scantibodies laboratory inc” below could result in an adverse outcome for us and any such adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 



the manufacturing processing formulation including stability packaging labeling marketing distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the ftc the epa and the cpsc in addition our and our suppliers’ operations are subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold  

in particular the fda regulates the formulation safety manufacturing packaging labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits battery operated toothbrushes overthecounter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements including vitamins and minerals the fda also exercises oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of our other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that we and our suppliers use to manufacture regulated products and may identify compliance issues that would require us and our suppliers to make certain changes in our manufacturing facilities and processes the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to regulatory action against the products made in that facility including seizure injunction or recall as well as to possible action against the owner of the facilitymanufacturer we may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until the compliance issue has been remediated as a result our business could be adversely affected  

likewise any future determination by the fda or a similar foreign agency or by us in reviewing our compliance with applicable rules and regulations that our products or quality systems do not comply with applicable regulations could result in future compliance activities including product withdrawals or recalls import detentions injunctions preventing the shipment of products or other enforcement actions for example the fda may determine that a particular claim that we use to support the marketing of a product is not substantiated may not accept the evidence of safety for a new product that we may wish to market may challenge the safety or effectiveness of existing products based on among other things changes in formulations inadequate stability or “shelflife” consumer complaints or improper labeling and may determine that our dietary supplement business manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations do not comply with cgmps similarly we may identify these or other issues in internal compliance reviews of our operations and the operations and products of vendors and acquired companies these other issues may include the identification of contaminants or noncompliant levels of particular ingredients any of the foregoing could subject us to adverse 

 

publicity force us to incur unanticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

from time to time congress the fda the ftc the commission or other federal state local or foreign legislative and regulatory authorities may impose additional laws or regulations that apply to us repeal laws or regulations that we consider favorable or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations for example we are subject to regulations regarding the transportation storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment as well as the commission’s rules with respect to “conflict minerals” additionally recent reform proposals have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries in addition to the major changes to us tax law recently signed into law major developments in trade relations could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations we are not able to predict the nature of these changes or of such future laws regulations repeals or interpretations or to predict the effect additional or shifting governmental regulation when and if it occurs would have on our business in the future such developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated additional recordkeeping requirements increased documentation of the properties of certain products additional or different labeling additional scientific substantiation expanded adverse event reporting or other new requirements any such developments could increase our costs significantly and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  



our international operations subject us to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 



























in addition changes as result of the united kingdom’s decision to exit the european union could subject us to heightened risks in that region including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods services and people to and from the united kingdom increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and additional legal and economic uncertainty moreover there may be additional shifts in us foreign trade economic and other policies that may materially affect our foreign operations and our ability to market our products in certain international markets all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to commercialize our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position in all foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions 

 



approximately 17 of our net sales in 2017 were to customers outside the us we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk both transaction and translation with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar outside of the us sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the canadian dollar euro pound brazilian real mexican peso chinese yuan and australian dollar a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we purchase materials and services in foreign markets although we from time to time enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed intercompany sales or purchases denominated in the us dollar canadian dollar pound and euro foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   



our ability to continue to grow our sales and profits is dependent on expanding in the locations in which we already do business and entering into new geographic locations both of which would require significant resources and investments which would affect our risk profile the failure to successfully enter into or expand our business in such locations could materially affect the growth of our business sales and results of operations



we seek to acquire or invest in businesses that offer products services or technologies that are complementary we have made 14 acquisitions in the past 14 years  

we may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future those acquisitions may be significantly larger than the ones completed in the past and may require the company to increase its levels of debt potentially resulting in the company being assigned a lower credit rating however we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive valuations obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions in recent periods competition from other consumer products companies that are seeking similar opportunities has been particularly strong and valuations for potential acquisition assets have been high which has placed pressure on our ability to identify structure and execute transactions in addition all acquisitions and investments entail various risks including the difficulty of entering new markets or product categories the challenges of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the ongoing business of the acquired company the need to review and if necessary upgrade processes of the acquired company to conform to our own processes and applicable legal and regulatory requirements and generally our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment any of these risks may divert management and other resources require us to incur unanticipated costs or delay the anticipated positive impact on our business and results of the acquisition the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent we acquire businesses that have standalone operations that cannot easily be integrated or operations or sources of supply outside of the us and canada for which products are manufactured locally by third parties these factors could harm our financial condition and operating results  larger acquisitions such as our acquisition of the waterpik brand in 2017 may require us to significantly increase our levels of debt 

acquired companies or operations or newlycreated ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made in addition future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the potentially dilutive issuances of new equity by us or the incurrence of additional debt or contingent liabilities all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and resources from other matters that are critical to our operations  



as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 2374 million of total consolidated indebtedness net of debt issuance costs this amount of indebtedness could have important consequences including



 









additionally our credit facility is subject to certain financial and other customary covenants  in the event of a breach of those covenants our lenders under the credit facility may be entitled to accelerate the related debt and any lenders in respect of any other debt to which a crossdefault provision applies may be entitled to accelerate such other debt and we could be required to seek amendments or waivers under the debt instruments or to refinance the debt

moreover we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes for example we substantially increased our indebtedness in order to finance the acquisition of waterpik in 2017 if additional new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify a substantial increase in our indebtedness could also have a negative impact on our credit rating  in this regard failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate available to us in future financings as well as our liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets any decision regarding future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time including market conditions and our credit rating  



our ability to repay and refinance our indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends primarily on our cash flow cash flow is often subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control and such factors may limit our ability to repay indebtedness and fund capital expenditures a failure to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition  



we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to conduct our business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to internal communications and communications with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers billing customers and receiving and applying payment processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements collecting and storing customer consumer employee investor and other stakeholder information and personal data and other processes necessary to manage our business 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems networks and services and those of our customers and other business partners as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and the data of our customers and other business partners as a result our information technology systems networks or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or we could suffer a loss or disclosure of business personal or stakeholder information due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages and security breaches although we have business continuity plans in place and have implemented a breach response plan to address service interruptions if these plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct our operations which may adversely affect our business we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers’ databases or systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time in addition although we have policies and procedures in place governing the secure storage of personal information collected by us or our thirdparty service providers data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct may occur in the future we may need to expend additional resources in the future to continue to protect against or to address problems caused by any business interruptions or data security breaches 

any business interruptions or data security breaches including cyber security breaches resulting in private data disclosure of personal data could result in lawsuits or regulatory proceedings damage our reputation or adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

 

 

in addition we from time to time need to upgrade our information technology systems if a new system does not function properly it could affect our ability to order supplies process and deliver customer orders and process and receive payments for our products this could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 



although the board has authorized new share repurchase programs in each of 2015 2016 and 2017 and recently increased the amount of the quarterly cash dividends payable on the common stock any board determinations to continue to repurchase the common stock or to continue to pay cash dividends on the common stock in each case at levels consistent with recent practice or at all will be based primarily upon our financial condition results of operations business requirements price of the common stock in the case of the repurchase programs and the board’s continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event we do not declare a quarterly dividend or discontinue our share repurchases our stock price could be adversely affected  



over the years the banking system and financial markets have experienced severe disruption including among other things bank failures and consolidations severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades declines in asset valuations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these conditions present the following risks to us among others

we are dependent on the continued viability of the financial institutions that participate in the syndicate that is generally obligated to fund our 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility dated december 4 2015 as amended the “credit agreement” in addition the credit agreement includes a “commitment increase” feature that enables us to increase the amount of our borrowing under the credit agreement subject to lending commitments and certain conditions any disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 

our short and longterm credit ratings affect our borrowing costs and access to financing a downgrade in our credit ratings as a result of a substantial increase in our indebtedness or otherwise would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit market also could raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings either scenario could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets

although we believe that our operating cash flows together with our access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity the inability of one or more institutions to fulfill funding obligations under the credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations  



our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized if the actual amount of our future taxable income is less than the amount we are currently projecting with respect to specific tax jurisdictions or if there is a change in the time period within which the deferred tax asset becomes deductible we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets the recording of a valuation allowance would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on our operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances which would have either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate    major developments in tax policy or trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and liquidity 

 



on december 22 2017 the president signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act which significantly changed the code including a reduction in the statutory corporate income tax rate to 21 a new limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense restrictions on the use of net operating loss carryforwards arising in taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and changes to the taxation of income earned from foreign sources and foreign subsidiaries including requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the tax cuts and jobs act also authorizes the treasury department to issue regulations with respect to the new provisions we cannot predict how the changes in the tax cuts and jobs act regulations or other guidance issued under it or conforming or nonconforming state tax rules might affect us or our business in addition there can be no assurance that us tax laws including the corporate income tax rate would not undergo significant changes in the near future



significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we provide for uncertain tax positions with respect to tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards mandated by applicable accounting guidance fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results we are regularly under audit by tax authorities and although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution  additionally adverse outcomes from tax audits that we may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 



the market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and brand names including arm  hammer trojan oxiclean l’il critters vitafusion and waterpik we own the material trademarks and brand names used in connection with the marketing and distribution of our major products both in the us and in other countries in addition we hold several valuable patents on our products which we believe serve as an effective barrier to entry for new competitors accordingly we rely on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights although most of our material intellectual property is registered in the us and in certain foreign countries in which we operate we cannot be sure that our intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or if necessary successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future and we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties infringe our intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with our brands and harm our sales our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition also our patents are granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed we do not consider any single patent to be material to the business as a whole  

in addition if our products are found to infringe intellectual property rights of others the owners of those rights could bring legal actions against us claiming substantial damages for past infringement and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products if these legal actions are successful in addition to any potential liability for damages from past infringement we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products potentially adding significant costs we might not prevail in any action brought against us or we may be unsuccessful in securing any license for continued use and therefore have to discontinue the marketing and sale of a product this could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition  

 



we have a material amount of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets as well as other longlived assets which are periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards declines in our profitability andor estimated cash flows related to specific intangible assets as well as potential changes in market valuations for similar assets and market discount rates has resulted in impairment charges from time to time and may result in future impairment charges which could reduce our net income and otherwise have an adverse impact on operating results 



our operations as well as the operations of our third party manufacturers suppliers and customers may be subject to disruption from a variety of causes including work stoppages material shortages financial difficulties acts of war terrorism pandemics fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  



our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations this effect could be exacerbated if any officers or other key personnel left as a group or at the same time our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements

overview

our business

we develop manufacture and market a broad range of consumer household and personal care and specialty products focused on animal productivity chemicals and cleaners we focus our consumer products marketing efforts principally on our 11 “power brands” these wellrecognized brand names include arm  hammer used in multiple product categories such as baking soda cat litter carpet deodorization and laundry detergent trojan condoms lubricants and vibrators oxiclean stain removers cleaning solutions laundry detergent dishwashing detergent and bleach alternatives spinbrush batteryoperated and manual toothbrushes first response home pregnancy and ovulation test kits nair depilatories orajel oral analgesic xtra laundry detergent l’il critters and vitafusion gummy dietary supplements batiste dry shampoos and in 2017 added waterpik water flossers and replacement showerheads

we sell our consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets mass merchandisers wholesale clubs drugstores convenience stores home stores dollar pet and other specialty stores and websites and other ecommerce channels all of which sell the products to consumers we sell our specialty products to industrial customers livestock producers and through distributors

we operate our business in three segments consumer domestic consumer international and spd the segments are based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures in 2017 the consumer domestic consumer international and spd segments represented approximately 76 16 and 8 respectively of our consolidated net sales

2017 financial highlights 

key fiscal year 2017 financial results include













strategic goals challenges and initiatives

our ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for our products and retail customers’ decisions to carry our products which are in part affected by general economic conditions in our markets although our consumer products generally are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products in 2017 many of the product categories in which we operate continued to experience pricing pressures and weak or inconsistent consumer demand some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and

oral analgesics categories and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category in additi on an increasing portion of our product categories is being sold by club stores dollar stores  mass merchandisers and internetbased retailers  these factors have placed downward pressure on our sales and gross margins 

we expect a competitive marketplace in 2018 due to new product introductions by competitors and continuing aggressive competitive pricing pressures in this environment we intend to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives maintain competitive marketing and trade spending tightly control our cost structure continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursue strategic acquisitions we also intend to continue to grow our product sales globally and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products to appeal to a wide range of consumers

there continues to be significant product and price competition in the premium and deep value laundry detergent categories and more recently product competition in the gummy vitamin category for example in the laundry detergent category pg and henkel the two largest laundry detergent companies in the us are engaged in aggressive pricing promotions and retailers are continuing to deemphasize the deep value tier of laundry detergents which is where xtra competes in addition the gummy vitamin category has grown from eight competitors to 30 in the last five years we continue to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through among other things new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending however there is no assurance the categories will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline 

we are continuously focused on strengthening our key brands such as arm  hammer oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion batiste and waterpik through the launch of innovative new products which span various product categories including premium and value household products supported by increased marketing and trade spending there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 

in 2017 we were able to grow market share in seven of 11 of our “power brands” in measured channels our global product portfolio consists of both premium 60 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2017 and value 40 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2017 brands which we believe enables us to succeed in a range of economic environments we intend to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among costconscious consumers

over the past 17 years we have diversified from an almost exclusively us business to a global company with approximately 17 of sales derived from foreign countries in 2017 we have operations in six countries canada mexico uk france australia and brazil recently established a subsidiary in germany and export to over 130 other countries in 2017 we benefited from our expanded global footprint however we have focused and will continue to focus on selectively expanding our global business net sales generated outside of the us are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as political uncertainty which could impact future operating results 

we also continue to focus on controlling our costs historically we have been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent by passing along some of these cost increases to customers we have also entered into set pricing and prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel additionally maintaining tight controls on overhead costs has been a hallmark of ours and has enabled us to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions 

the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of our overall strategy acquisitions have added significantly to our sales and profits over the last decade this is recently evidenced by our 2015 acquisition of certain assets of varied industries corporation the “vicor acquisition” 2016 acquisitions of spencer forrest inc the maker of toppik the “toppik acquisition” and the anusol and rectinol businesses from johnson  johnson the “anusol acquisition” and 2017 acquisitions of viviscal from lifes2good holdings limited the “viviscal acquisition” agro biosciences inc the “agro acquisition” and waterpik from pik holdings inc the “waterpik acquisition” however the failure to effectively integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause us to incur material asset writedowns we actively seek acquisitions that fit our guidelines and our strong financial position provides us with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in addition our ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled us to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions since 2001 we have acquired 10 of our 11 “power brands” 

we believe we are positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to our strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives maintaining competitive marketing and trade spending managing our cost structure continuing to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursuing strategic acquisitions this focus together with the strength of our portfolio of premium and value brands has enabled us to succeed in a range of economic environments  and is expected to position us to continue to increase stockholder value over the longterm moreover the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations as a result of net income and effective working capital management

recent developments

 

 

us tax reform

 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act significantly changes the us corporate income tax regime by among other things lowering us corporate income tax rates to 21 however the tax act eliminates the domestic manufacturing deduction and moves toward a territorial system which also eliminates the ability to credit certain foreign taxes that existed prior to enactment of the tax act there are also certain transitional impacts of the tax act as part of the transition to the new territorial tax system the tax act imposes a onetime repatriation tax on a deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries we intend to repatriate some of our nonus earnings and pay the associated repatriation tax in addition the reduction of the us corporate tax rate caused us to adjust our us deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of 21 these transitional impacts resulted in a provisional net credit of approximately 273 for the quarter and year ended december 31 2017 the credit is primarily due to the adjustment to the us deferred tax asset and liabilities 

 

the changes included in the tax act are broad and complex the final transitional impacts of the tax act may differ from the above estimate possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations of the tax act any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tax act any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax act or any updates or changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the transitional impacts the commission has issued guidance that allows for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the tax act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts we currently anticipate finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments by the end of the measurement period

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty they are based on our historical experience our observation of trends in industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate our significant accounting policies and estimates are described below 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves

virtually all of our revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by our customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for our products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold we rely on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example we use historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements an approximately 34 difference in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns we use experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if our estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 78 while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations during the twelve months ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 we reduced promotion liabilities by approximately 06 54 and 43 respectively based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information these adjustments are immaterial relative to the amount of trade promotion expense incurred annually by us 

impairment of goodwill trade names and other intangible assets 

carrying values of goodwill trade names and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment  for finite intangible assets we assess business triggering events our impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trade names and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired the result of our annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units in addition there were no goodwill impairment charges for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2017

 

fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” or “excess earnings” discounted cash flow method which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change and therefore could impact fair values in the future we determined that the fair value of all other intangible assets for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2017 exceeded their respective carrying values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability there is a personal care trade name that based on recent performance has experienced sales and profit declines that have eroded a significant portion of the excess between fair and carrying value which could potentially result in an impairment of the asset in 2017 this excess has been reduced to approximately 340 or 12 due in large part to an increased competitive market environment therefore resulting in reduced cash flow projections as a result this indefinitelived intangible asset is more susceptible to impairment risk  while management can and has implemented strategies to address the risk significant changes in operating plans or adverse 

church  dwight co inc and subsidiaries

dollars in millions except share and per share data

 

changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of this asset 

it is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if for example i the businesses or brands do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in 2018 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

inventory valuation

when appropriate we write down the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value which reflects any costs to sell or dispose we identify any slow moving obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is required to establish a new carrying value the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for our products technological changes and new product introductions in addition our allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units skus we evaluate our inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and record adjustments as required adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were 128 at december 31 2017 105 at december 31 2016 and 126 at december 31 2015

income taxes

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized we record liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under us gaap guidelines the liabilities relate to tax return positions that although supportable by us may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement we adjust this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change in this regard settlement of any issue or an adverse determination in litigation with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate conversely favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate

consolidated results 

2017 compared to 2016



net sales 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2017 were 37762 an increase of 2831 or 81 compared to 2016 net sales the components of the net sales increase are as follows 





all three segments reported volume increases both consumer domestic and consumer international experienced unfavorable pricemix 

our gross profit for 2017 was 17296 a 1390 increase compared to 2016 gross margin was 458 in 2017 compared to 455 in 2016 a 30 basis points “bps” increase the increase is due to the impact of higher margins on acquired businesses representing 80 bps favorable volume of 70 bps and lower manufacturing costs of 40 bps partially offset by unfavorable pricemix of 140 bps primarily due to higher promotion and coupon costs higher commodity costs of 30 bps and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates of 10 bps gross margin in 2016 included a plant impairment charge of 20 bps at an international subsidiary

operating costs 

marketing expenses for 2017 were 4542 an increase of 270 compared to 2016 acquired businesses contributed modestly to the increase marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 bps to 120 in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to 90 bps of leverage on higher net sales partially offset by 70 bps on higher expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” expenses for 2017 were 5427 an increase of 1035 or 236 compared to 2016 the increase is primarily due to the 392 international pension settlement charge transition and ongoing

the increase in net sales for 2017 reflects the impact of acquisitions higher sales of arm  hammer liquid and unit dose detergents batiste dry shampoo oxiclean stain fighters and arm  hammer cat litter partially offset by lower sales of trojan condoms xtra laundry detergent and gummy vitamins

 

there continues to be significant product and price competition in the premium and deep value laundry detergent categories and more recently product competition in the gummy vitamin category for example in the laundry detergent category pg and henkel the two largest laundry detergent companies in the us are engaged in aggressive pricing promotions and retailers are continuing to deemphasize the deep value tier of laundry detergents which is where xtra competes in addition the gummy vitamin category has grown from eight competitors to 30 in the last five years we continue to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through among other things new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending however there is no assurance the categories will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline

competition for consumer domestic and consumer international

the company competes in the household and personal care consumer product categories which are highly innovative categories characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and require significant advertising and promotion the company competes in these categories primarily on the basis of product innovation and performance brand recognition price value and other consumer benefits consumer products particularly laundry and household cleaning products as well as certain toothpaste products are subject to significant price competition as a result the company from time to time may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share

the ftc exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements the ftc considers whether a product’s advertising claims are accurate truthful and not misleading pursuant to its authority under the federal trade commission act or ftc act the ftc has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of otherwise false or misleading advertising claims these enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties andor restitution by the companies involved such actions can result in substantial financial penalties and significantly restrict the marketing of a dietary supplement

risk factors 

tableend

the following risks and uncertainties as well as other factors described elsewhere in this annual report or in other filings by the company with the commission could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 



unfavorable and uncertain economic conditions have adversely affected and in the future may adversely affect demand for some of the categories of products the company sells resulting in reduced sales volume or market share or a shift in its product mix from higher margin to lower margin products factors that can affect demand include competitors’ products advertising and pricing actions rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs including increased costs as a result of recent or future changes in federal regulations commodity costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior including delays in the timing of tax refunds from the federal government gasoline and home heating oil pricing reduced unemployment benefits in periods of high unemployment and tax increases while the vast majority of the company’s products are consumer staples that generally are less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products they may become subject to increasing price competition additionally some of the company’s products such as laundry additives gummy dietary supplements and batteryoperated toothbrushes are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending for example recent deflation in dairy products primarily milk has adversely affected sales of our animal productivity products although we experienced a slight increase in demand for dairy products in the later part of 2016 the demand for dairy products may decline in the future and sales growth in that category may decline as a result 

some of the company’s customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs home stores and dollar pet and other specialty stores have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to the company on a timely basis or at all the company regularly reviews the financial strength of its key customers and where appropriate modifies customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales because the same economic conditions that affect the company also affect many of the company’s suppliers the company regularly conducts a similar review of its suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to the company’s operations when appropriate the company identifies alternate sources of materials and services to date the company has not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting its customers or suppliers however a protracted economic downturn that adversely affects the company’s suppliers and customers could adversely affect its sales and results of operations  



the company faces increasingly intense competition from consumer products companies both in the us and in international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widelyadvertised brands within each product category and with private label brands and generic nonbranded products of its customers in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers consumer products are subject to significant price competition as a result the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products or increase prices by an amount that does not cover manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices or inability to raise prices sufficiently to cover manufacturing cost increases would harm profit margins in addition if the company’s sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins its sales growth and other results of operations would suffer  

advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on retail customer decisions regarding the brands and product lines they sell and on consumer purchasing decisions a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs are not effective its sales growth may decline  

many of the company’s competitors are large companies including pg the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson nestle purina petcare company ansell limited alere inc pfizer inc bayer ag sc johnson  son inc pharmavite llc and nbty inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than does the company and therefore have the capacity to outspend the company on advertising and promotional activities and introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than can the company in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those 

 

typically offered by it competitive activity may require the company to increase it s spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced profits and adversely affect growth if the company loses market share or the markets in which it competes do not grow substantially its sales growth will decline    

there is significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category for example pg markets a lowerpriced line of laundry detergents simply tide which competes directly with the company’s core value laundry detergents pg has significantly increased its discounting of simply tide which could have a broad negative impact on the laundry category pricing and profitability in addition in 2016 henkel entered the premium laundry detergent segment with persil its leading worldwide premium laundry detergent and acquired sun products making henkel the second largest laundry detergent company in the us while it is too early to assess what impact this will have on the company’s laundry detergent business the introduction of persil and henkel’s increased scale and market share could precipitate greater price competition in the category and distribution pressure with a potential adverse impact on the company’s laundry detergent business additionally while the category grew 33 in 2016 05 in the fourth quarter of 2016 after experiencing growth in 2015 and a decline in 2014 there is no assurance the category will not decline in the future and that the company will be able to offset any such decline



a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales walmart is the company’s largest customer accounting for approximately 24 of net sales in 2016 24 of net sales in 2015 and 25 of net sales in 2014 the company’s top three customers accounted for approximately 35 of net sales in 2016 35 of net sales in 2015 and 36 of net sales in 2014 the company expects that a significant portion of its net sales will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues as a result changes in the strategies of walmart or any of the company’s other largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or of shelf space they dedicate to private label products could materially harm the company’s net sales and profitability  in addition if the company were to lose a significant customer due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues this could also have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders as it rarely enters into longterm contracts with its customers and most customer agreements include customer termination rights after short notice accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations  



in recent years retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally has increased this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailer customers who may demand lower pricing special packaging or impose other requirements on the company these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship some of the company’s customers particularly its highvolume retail store customers have sought to obtain pricing and other concessions and better trade terms to the extent the company provides concessions or better trade terms to those customers its margins are reduced further if the company is unable to effectively respond to the demands of its customers these customers could reduce their purchases of company products and increase their purchases of products from competitors which would harm the company’s sales and profitability in addition reductions in inventory by the company’s customers including as a result of consolidations in the retail industry or these customers managing their working capital requirements could result in reduced orders for company products and adversely affect its results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions  

protracted unfavorable market conditions have caused many of the company’s customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell and reduce or discontinue certain of the company’s product lines particularly those products that were not number one or two in their category if this continues to occur and the company is unable to improve distribution for those products at other customers its results could be adversely affected  

in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains are typically sold at lower prices than branded products as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending the company’s customers have discontinued or reduced distribution of some of its products to encourage those consumers to purchase the customers’ less expensive and in some cases more profitable private label products primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories to the extent customers discontinue or reduce distribution of the company’s products or these products are adversely affected by customers’ actions to increase shelf space for their private label products the company would seek to improve distribution with other customers however if the company’s efforts are not effective its sales growth and other results as well as its market share could be adversely affected 

 



the company’s performance depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and the financial difficulties of the company’s retailer customers consumer products such as those marketed by the company are increasingly being sold by club stores dollar stores mass merchandisers and internetbased retailers sales of the company’s products remain strongest in the traditional mass merchandiser food and drug retail stores and the company’s products are also being sold in club stores and dollar stores channels additionally certain consumer products are now offered through internetbased subscription services or buying clubs in 2016 unilever acquired dollar shave club a subscriptionbased razor blade company and in july 2016 pg launched tide wash club an online subscription service for its unitdose laundry detergent although the company has taken steps to improve and has seen improvement in sales to club stores dollar stores and internetbased retailers and is engaged in ecommerce with respect to its toppik and newly acquired viviscal brands if the current trend continues and the company is not successful in further improving sales to these channels its financial condition and operating results could suffer  



a significant percentage of the company’s revenues come from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during 2016 approximately 84 of the company’s sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to the company’s most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes dietary supplements antiperspirants and deodorants the company’s ability to achieve unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of its products by consumers relative to competitors’ products its ability to drive growth through product innovation in existing and new product categories investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from its competitors if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that expand its product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its sales growth objectives even if the company is successful in increasing sales within its product categories a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for the company’s products could have a negative impact on its financial results 



from time to time the company initiates expansion projects with respect to its facilities as is customary with large construction projects these projects are subject to risks of and the company has from time to time experienced delay or cost overruns resulting from numerous factors including the following shortages of equipment materials or skilled labor work stoppages unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment unanticipated cost increases difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions difficulties in meeting regulatory or quality requirements or obtaining regulatory approvals availability of suppliers to certify equipment for existing and enhanced regulations design and engineering problems and failure or delay of third party service providers civil unrest and labor disputes significant cost overruns or delays in completing a project or the miscalculations of our anticipated capacity needs could have a material adverse effect on the company’s return on investment results of operations and cash flows if the company were to experience delays or cost overruns in the future it could result in product allocation and retailer frustration the loss of a significant customer or customers or if sales of any of its products were to materially decrease due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues this could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally the supply of the company’s products depends on the uninterrupted efficient operation of its manufacturing facilities and ability to meet customer service levels many of the company’s manufacturing processes are complex and present difficult technical challenges to obtain the manufacturing yields necessary to operate profitably in addition the company’s manufacturing processes may require complex and specialized equipment which can be expensive to repair or replace with required lead times of up to a year

the manufacturing of certain of the company’s products is concentrated in one or more of its plants or contract manufacturers with limited alternate facilities any event that negatively impacts manufacturing facilities manufacturing systems or equipment or contract manufacturers or suppliers could delay or suspend shipments of products or the release of new products or could result in the delivery of inferior products the company’s revenues from the affected products would decline and it could incur losses until such time as the company or its contract manufacturers are able to restore production processes or are able to put in place alternative contract manufacturers or suppliers

 



the company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain of its commodities and raw materials including sole source suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers may have to be qualified under governmental industry and company standards which can require additional investment and time the company may be unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships based on a variety of factors it may be unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business certain of its suppliers may not meet the standards of the company’s customers or licensors or certain of the company’s key suppliers may become insolvent or experience other financial distress if any of these events occurs and the company has failed to identify and qualify an alternative vendor then it may be unable to meet its contractual obligations and customer expectations which could damage its reputation and result in lost customers and sales or the company may incur higher than expected expenses either of which could materially and adversely affect its business operations and results of operations  



the principal raw materials and packaging used by the company include surfactants cleaning agents paper products and resinbased molded components volatility and increases in the price of raw materials or increases in the costs of energy shipping and other necessary services could significantly affect the company’s profit margins if it is unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution historically the company has attempted to address such price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of its products entering into prebuying or lockedin pricing arrangements with certain suppliers and entering into hedge agreements there is no assurance however that the company will be able to fully offset any price increases especially given the competitive environment in addition volatility in certain commodity markets could significantly affect the company’s production cost and therefore harm its financial condition and operating results  

from time to time the company uses hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to product costs enabling the company to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in prices over the term of the contract however in periods of declining fuel prices the hedge agreements can have the effect of locking the company in at abovemarket prices  



the company’s future performance and growth depends on its ability to successfully identify develop and introduce new products and product line extensions the company cannot be certain that it will achieve its innovation goals the successful development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development marketing and promotional expenditures which the company may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays competitor actions regulatory approval hurdles and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of existing products the company’s financial performance could be harmed  

each year the company introduces new products including launches into new “white space” categories across the majority of its marketed brands historically new product acceptance has generally been widespread across the retailer base there is no assurance however that the company’s customers and consumers will continue to purchase these new products if new products are not successful in generating sales growth the company’s financial results could suffer from time to time the company has discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs the company may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent it discontinues products that do not meet retailer or consumer expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand  



we distribute our products and receive raw materials and packaging components primarily by truck rail and ship and through various ports of entry reduced availability of trucking rail or shipping capacity due to adverse weather conditions allocation of assets to other industries or geographies or otherwise work stoppages strikes or shutdowns of ports of entry or such transportation 

 

sources  could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials or packaging components in a timely manner which could disrupt our operations strain our customer relationships and competitive position and adversely affect our operating profits 



the company’s financial success is directly dependent on the reputation and success of its brands particularly the arm  hammer oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion brands the effectiveness of these brands could suffer if the company’s marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further the company’s results could be adversely affected if one or more of its other leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived sustainability quality or safety issues  

additionally claims made in the company’s marketing campaigns may become subject to litigation alleging false advertising which if successful could cause the company to alter its marketing plans and may materially and adversely affect sales or result in the imposition of significant damages against the company or other customer or consumer dissatisfaction especially if such dissatisfaction were to be broadly disseminated including through the use of social media 

 

widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination negative or inaccurate posting or comments about the company in the media or on any social networking website or the disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information through social media could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands in addition given the association of our individual products with the company an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products or the company as a whole thereby potentially adversely impacting the company’s financial results 



from time to time the company is subject to product liability claims the company may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by its products including losses or injuries caused by raw materials or other components provided by third party suppliers that are included in the company’s products claims could be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants are improperly labeled or designed or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances whether or not successful product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s sales and operating results and the reputation of its brands in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective or noncompliant with applicable rules or regulations it could be required to withdraw or recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability and product recall insurance coverage potential product liability claims and withdrawal and recall costs may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition  



the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties the company has incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations it is possible that the company could become subject to other environmental remediation costs and liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition



 

the company in the ordinary course of its business is and from time to time may become the subject of or party to various pending or threatened legal actions government investigations and proceedings including without limitation those relating to commercial transactions product liability purported consumer class actions employment matters antitrust environmental health safety and other compliancerelated matters such proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of certain pending or threatened legal actions may not be reasonably predictable and any related damages may not be estimable certain pending or future legal actions for example the matter described under “item 3 legal proceedings  scantibodies laboratory inc” below could 

 

result in an adverse outcome for the company and any such adverse outcome could have a material adver se effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 



the manufacturing processing formulation including stability packaging labeling marketing distribution and sale of the company’s products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the ftc the epa and the cpsc in addition the company’s and its suppliers’ operations are subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board the company’s activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which its products are sold  

in particular the fda regulates the formulation safety manufacturing packaging labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits battery operated toothbrushes overthecounter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements including vitamins and minerals the fda also exercises oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of the company’s other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that the company and its suppliers use to manufacture regulated products and may identify compliance issues that would require the company and its suppliers to make certain changes in its manufacturing facilities and processes the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to regulatory action against the products made in that facility including seizure injunction or recall as well as to possible action against the owner of the facilitymanufacturer the company may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until the compliance issue has been remediated as a result the company’s business could be adversely affected  

likewise any future determination by the fda or a similar foreign agency or by the company in reviewing its compliance with applicable rules and regulations that the company’s products or quality systems do not comply with applicable regulations could result in future compliance activities including product withdrawals or recalls import detentions injunctions preventing the shipment of products or other enforcement actions for example the fda may determine that a particular claim that the company uses to support the marketing of a product is not substantiated may not accept the evidence of safety for a new product that the company may wish to market may challenge the safety or effectiveness of existing products based on among other things changes in formulations inadequate stability or “shelflife” consumer complaints or improper labeling and may determine that the company’s dietary supplement business manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations do not comply with cgmps similarly the company may identify these or other issues in internal compliance reviews of its operations and the operations and products of vendors and acquired companies these other issues may include the identification of contaminants or noncompliant levels of particular ingredients any of the foregoing could subject the company to adverse publicity force it to incur unanticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations  

in addition the commission has promulgated federally mandated rules regarding disclosure of the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold known as “conflict minerals” in products manufactured by public companies certain of the company’s products including its diagnostic test kits and spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrushes use these minerals sourced through third parties the new rules require the company to conduct due diligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo the drc or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the drc the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs to determine the origin of minerals used in its products in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of such minerals used in the company’s products also the company may face disqualification as a supplier for customers and reputational challenges or may need to discontinue supply from its suppliers if its due diligence procedures do not enable it to verify the origins for the minerals used in its products or determine that the minerals are conflict free  

from time to time congress the fda the ftc the commission or other federal state local or foreign legislative and regulatory authorities may impose additional laws or regulations that apply to the company repeal laws or regulations that the company considers favorable or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations the new presidential administration is expected to introduce changes to the administration of federal regulatory agencies including changes in policy and personnel at the fda the ftc and the commission the company is not able to predict the nature of these changes or of such future laws regulations repeals or interpretations or to predict the effect additional or shifting governmental regulation when and if it occurs would have on its business in the future such developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated additional recordkeeping requirements increased documentation of the properties of certain products additional or different labeling additional scientific substantiation expanded adverse event reporting or other new requirements any such developments could increase the company’s costs significantly and could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations  

 



the company’s international operations subject it to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 































in addition changes as result of the united kingdom’s referendum approved by a majority of votes to exit the european union could subject the company to heightened risks in that region including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods services and people to and from the united kingdom increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the british pound and additional legal and economic uncertainty moreover following the 2016 us presidential and congressional elections and the related transition to a new presidential administration there may be shifts in us foreign trade economic and other policies that may materially affect our foreign operations and our ability to market our products in certain international markets all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position in all foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates it is subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions 



approximately 16 of the company’s net sales were to customers outside the us in 2016 the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk both transaction and translation with respect to its sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar outside of the us sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the canadian dollar euro pound brazilian real mexican peso chinese yuan and australian dollar a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which the company purchases materials and services in foreign markets although the company from time to time enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed intercompany sales or purchases denominated in the us dollar canadian dollar pound and euro foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations   

 



the company’s ability to continue to grow its sales and profits is dependent on expanding in the locations in which it already does business and entering into new geographic locations both of which would require significant resources and investments which would affect the company’s risk profile the failure to successfully enter into or expand its business in such locations could materially affect the growth of the company’s business sales and results of operations



the company seeks to acquire or invest in businesses that offer products services or technologies that are complementary the company has made 12 acquisitions in the past 13 years including the following brands spinbrush batterypowered toothbrushes oxiclean kaboom and orange glo cleaning products orajel oral analgesics simply saline nasal moisturizers feline pine natural cat litter batiste dry shampoo l’il critters and vitafusion dietary supplements rephresh and replens feminine care products vi cor feed ingredients for dairy cows beef cattle poultry and other livestock  toppik a leading brand of hair building fibers for people with thinning hair in december 2016 anusol and rectinol hemorrhoid products and in january 2017 viviscal a nondrug hair growth supplement 

the company may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future those acquisitions may be significantly larger than the ones completed in the past and may require the company to increase its levels of debt potentially resulting in the company being assigned a lower credit rating however the company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive valuations obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions in recent periods competition from other consumer products companies that are seeking similar opportunities has been particularly strong and valuations for potential acquisition assets have been high which has placed pressure on the company’s ability to identify structure and execute transactions in addition all acquisitions and investments entail various risks including the difficulty of entering new markets or product categories the challenges of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of the company’s ongoing business and the ongoing business of the acquired company the need to review and if necessary upgrade processes of the acquired company to conform to the company’s own processes and applicable legal and regulatory requirements and generally the company’s potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment any of these risks may divert management and other resources require the company to incur unanticipated costs or delay the anticipated positive impact on the company’s business and results of the acquisition the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent the company acquires businesses that have standalone operations that cannot easily be integrated or operations or sources of supply outside of the us and canada for which products are manufactured locally by third parties these factors could harm the company’s financial condition and operating results  

acquired companies or operations or newlycreated ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made in addition future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the potentially dilutive issuances of new equity by the company or the incurrence of additional debt or contingent liabilities all of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and resources from other matters that are critical to the company’s operations  



the company relies extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to conduct its business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to internal communications and communications with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers billing customers and receiving and applying payment processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements collecting and storing customer consumer employee investor and other stakeholder information and personal data and other processes necessary to manage the company’s business in addition the company is engaged in ecommerce with respect to its toppik brand and the recently acquired viviscal brand

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of the information technology systems networks and services of the company its customers and 

 

other business partners  as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data of the company its customers and other business partners  as a result t he company’s information technology systems networks or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or the company could suffer a loss or disclosure of business  personal or stakeholder information due to any number of causes including catastrop hic events power outages and security breaches although the company has business continuity plans in place and has implement ed a breach response plan to address service interruptions if these plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a ti mely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct its operations which may adversely affect its business the company cannot guarantee that its security efforts will prevent attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of the company’s or its thirdparty service providers’ databases or systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time in addition although we have policies and procedures in place gove rning the secure storage of personal information collected by the company or its thirdparty service providers data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct may occur in the future the company may need to expend additional res ources in the future to continue to protect against or to address problems caused by any business interruptions or data security breaches 

any business interruptions or data security breaches including cyber security breaches resulting in private data disclosure of personal data could result in lawsuits or regulatory proceedings damage the company’s reputation or adversely impact the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

 

in addition the company from time to time needs to upgrade its information technology systems if a new system does not function properly it could affect our ability to order supplies process and deliver customer orders and process and receive payments for our products this could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows



as of december 31 2016 the company had approximately 1120 million of total consolidated indebtedness net of debt issuance costs this amount of indebtedness could have important consequences including











additionally the company’s credit facility is subject to certain financial and other customary covenants  in the event of a breach of those covenants our lenders under the credit facility may be entitled to accelerate the related debt and any lenders in respect of any other debt to which a crossdefault provision applies may be entitled to accelerate such other debt and we could be required to seek amendments or waivers under the debt instruments or to refinance the debt

moreover the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify a substantial increase in the company’s indebtedness could also have a negative impact on the company’s credit rating  in this regard failure to maintain the companys credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate available to the company in future financings as well as the company’s liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets any decision regarding future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time including market conditions and the company’s credit rating  



the company’s ability to repay and refinance its indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends primarily on its cash flow cash flow is often subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond the company’s control and such factors may limit its ability to repay indebtedness and fund capital expenditures a failure to service its indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition  

 



although the board has authorized new share repurchase programs in each of 2014 2015 and 2016 and recently increased the amount of the quarterly cash dividends payable on the common stock any board determinations to continue to repurchase the common stock or to continue to pay cash dividends on the common stock in each case at levels consistent with recent practice or at all will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations business requirements price of the common stock in the case of the repurchase programs and the board’s continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of company stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event the company does not declare a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases its stock price could be adversely affected  



over the years the banking system and financial markets have experienced severe disruption including among other things bank failures and consolidations severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades declines in asset valuations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these conditions present the following risks to the company among others

the company is dependent on the continued viability of the financial institutions that participate in the syndicate that is generally obligated to fund the company’s 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility dated december 4 2015 as amended the “credit agreement” in addition the credit agreement includes a “commitment increase” feature that enables the company to increase the amount of its borrowing under the credit agreement subject to lending commitments and certain conditions any disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit which could adversely affect the company’s liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s short and longterm credit ratings affect its borrowing costs and access to financing a downgrade in the company’s credit ratings as a result of a substantial increase in the company’s indebtedness or otherwise would increase its borrowing costs and could affect its ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit market also could raise the company’s borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings either scenario could adversely affect the company’s liquidity and capital resources failure to maintain the company’s credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets

although the company believes that its operating cash flows together with its access to the credit markets provides it with significant discretionary funding capacity the inability of one or more institutions to fulfill funding obligations under the credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity and operations  



the company’s future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized if the actual amount of the company’s future taxable income is less than the amount it is currently projecting with respect to specific tax jurisdictions or if there is a change in the time period within which the deferred tax asset becomes deductible the company could be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets the recording of a valuation allowance would result in an increase in the company’s effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on its operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change the company’s deferred tax assets or liability balances which would have either a favorable or unfavorable impact on its effective tax rate  additionally reform proposals put forth by members of the us congress and the new presidential administration have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries major developments in tax policy or trade relations such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and liquidity 



significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions the company provides for uncertain tax positions with respect to tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards mandated by applicable accounting guidance fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact the company’s effective tax rate and its financial results the 

 

company is regularly under audit by tax authorities and although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation co uld be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company’s effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution  additionally adverse outcomes from tax audits that we may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 



the market for the company’s products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with its trademarks and brand names including arm  hammer trojan oxiclean l’il critters and vitafusion the company owns the material trademarks and brand names used in connection with the marketing and distribution of its major products both in the us and in other countries in addition the company holds several valuable patents on its products which the company believes serve as an effective barrier to entry for new competitors accordingly the company relies on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property rights although most of the company’s material intellectual property is registered in the us and in certain foreign countries in which it operates it cannot be sure that its intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or if necessary successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of the company’s brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the company’s failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make it less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition also the company’s patents are granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed the company does not consider any single patent to be material to the business as a whole  

in addition if the company’s products are found to infringe intellectual property rights of others the owners of those rights could bring legal actions against the company claiming substantial damages for past infringement and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products if these legal actions are successful in addition to any potential liability for damages from past infringement the company could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products potentially adding significant costs the company might not prevail in any action brought against it or it may be unsuccessful in securing any license for continued use and therefore have to discontinue the marketing and sale of a product this could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition  



the company has a material amount of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets as well as other longlived assets which are periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards declines in the company’s profitability andor estimated cash flows related to specific intangible assets as well as potential changes in market valuations for similar assets and market discount rates has resulted in impairment charges from time to time and may result in future impairment charges which could reduce the company’s net income and otherwise have an adverse impact on operating results 



the company’s operations as well as the operations of its third party manufacturers suppliers and customers may be subject to disruption from a variety of causes including work stoppages material shortages financial difficulties acts of war terrorism pandemics fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business  

 



the company’s future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business prospects financial condition and results of operations this effect could be exacerbated if any officers or other key personnel left as a group or at the same time the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future  



currently approximately 2 of the authorized number of shares of our common stock remain available for issuance under our restated certificate of incorporation under delaware law stockholder approval is required in order to amend our restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock we anticipate including such a proposal for consideration at our next annual meeting of stockholders however we cannot provide any assurances that our stockholders will approve that proposal if our stockholders do not approve such an amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation we may be unable to take timely advantage of market conditions and issue common stock for a variety of purposes including stock splits or other recapitalizations acquisitions and other business development transactions and strategic growth initiatives equity financings grants of stock options and other equitybased instruments and other corporate purposes

strategic goals challenges and initiatives 

the company’s ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for its products and retail customers’ decisions to carry its products which are in part affected by general economic conditions in its markets in 2016 many of the markets in which the company operates continued to experience pricing pressures general economic softness and weak or inconsistent consumer demand although the company’s consumer products generally are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products the continued economic downturn has reduced demand in many categories particularly those in personal care and affected company sales in recent periods some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category in addition an increasing portion of the company’s product categories are being sold by club stores dollar stores and mass merchandisers these customer actions have placed downward pressure on the company’s sales and gross margins

the company expects a competitive marketplace in 2017 due to new product introductions by competitors and continuing aggressive competitive pricing pressures in the us an improving unemployment rate and higher disposable income due to low gasoline prices are expected to have a positive effect on consumption patterns to continue to deliver attractive results for stockholders in this environment the company intends to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives maintain competitive marketing and trade spending tightly control its cost structure continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursue strategic acquisitions the company also intends to continue to grow its product sales geographically in an attempt to mitigate the impact of weakness in any one area and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products to appeal to a wide range of consumers

there continues to be significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category for example pg markets a lowerpriced line of laundry detergents simply tide which competes directly with the company’s core value laundry detergents pg has significantly increased its discounting of simply tide which could have a broad negative impact on the laundry category pricing and profitability in addition in 2016 henkel entered the us market with persil its leading worldwide premium laundry detergent and on september 1 2016 completed its acquisition of sun products the maker of all wisk sun and private label laundry detergents while it is too early to assess what impact this will have on the company’s laundry detergent business the introduction of persil and henkel’s increased scale and market share could precipitate greater price competition in the category and distribution pressure with a potential adverse impact on the company’s laundry detergent business moreover the unit dose laundry detergent segment is the fastest growing segment in the laundry detergent category having grown to approximately 16 of the category since its introduction in 2012 and the company faces pressure to achieve its proportionate share of the segment with a potential adverse impact on its share of the laundry detergent category the company continues to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through among other things new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending additionally while the category grew 33 for the 52 weeks ended december 17 2016 and 16 for the 52 weeks ended december 19 2015 after experiencing declines in 2013 and 2014 there is no assurance the category will not decline in the future and that the company will be able to offset any such decline 

the company has responded to these competitive pressures by among other things focusing on strengthening its key brands including increased focus on the arm  hammer oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion and batiste brands through the launch of innovative new products which span various product categories including premium and value household products supported by increased marketing and trade spending there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 

in 2016 the company was able to grow market share in four of 10 of its “power brands” in measured channels the company’s global product portfolio consists of both premium 60 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2016 and value 40 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2016 brands which it believes enables it to succeed in a range of economic environments the company intends to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among costconscious consumers

over the past 16 years the company has diversified from an almost exclusively us business to a global company with approximately 16 of sales derived from foreign countries in 2016 the company has operations in six countries canada mexico uk france australia and brazil and exports to over 90 other countries in 2016 the company benefited from its concentration in north america in light of the economic downturn in europe however the company has focused and will continue to focus on selectively expanding its global business net sales generated outside of the united states are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as political uncertainty which could impact future operating results 

the company also continues to focus on controlling its costs historically the company has been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent by passing along some of these cost

increases to customers the company has also entered into set pricing and prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel additionally maintaining tight controls on overhead co sts has been a hallmark of the company and has enabled it to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions 

the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of the company’s overall strategy acquisitions have added significantly to company sales and profits over the last decade this is evidenced by the company’s 2015 acquisition of certain assets of varied industries corporation the “vicor acquisition” and 2016 acquisitions of spencer forrest inc the maker of toppik and the anusol and rectinol businesses from johnson  johnson in the anusol acquisition however the failure to effectively integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause the company to incur material asset writedowns the company actively seeks acquisitions that fit its guidelines and its strong financial position provides it with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in addition the company’s ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled it to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions since 2001 the company has acquired nine of its ten “power brands” 

the company believes it is positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives maintaining competitive marketing and trade spending managing its cost structure continuing to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursuing strategic acquisitions this focus together with the strength of the company’s portfolio of premium and value brands has enabled the company to succeed in a range of economic environments  and is expected to position the company to continue to increase stockholder value over the longterm moreover the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations as a result of net income and effective working capital management combined with an investment grade credit rating provides the company with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions drive new product development make capital expenditures to support organic growth and gross margin improvements return cash to stockholders through dividends and share buy backs and reduce outstanding debt positioning it to continue to create stockholder value

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty they are based on the company’s historical experience its observation of trends in industry information provided by its customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate the company’s significant accounting policies and estimates are described below 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves

virtually all of the company’s revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by the company’s customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on the company’s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company’s products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements an approximately 41 difference in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns the company uses experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if the company’s estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 64 while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations during the twelve months ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 the company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately 54 43 and 67 respectively based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information these adjustments are immaterial relative to the amount of trade promotion expense incurred annually by the company 

impairment of goodwill trade names and other intangible assets 

carrying values of goodwill trade names and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment  for finite intangible assets the company assesses business triggering events the company’s impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trade names and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired the result of the company’s annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units in addition there were no goodwill impairment charges for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2016

church  dwight co inc and subsidiaries

dollars in millions except share and per share data

 

in 2014 the company recorded an impairment charge of 50 for an intangible asset related to the consumer domestic segment the impairment charge recorded in 201 4 was a result of actual and projected reductions in sales and profitability as a result of increased competition the amount of the imp airment charges was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying amount fair value was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” or “excess earnings” discounted cash flow method which contains numerous variables that ar e subject to change as business conditions change and therefore could impact fair values in the future the company determined that the fair value of all other intangible assets as of december 31 201 6 exceeded their respective carrying values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability  

it is possible that the company’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if for example i the businesses or brands do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in 2017 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

inventory valuation

the fdca permits “statements of nutritional support” to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without fda premarket approval the fda must be notified of those statements within 30 days of marketing among other things the statements may describe the role of a dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function of the body or characterize the documented mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient maintains such structure or function but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose cure mitigate treat or prevent a disease a company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess information substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading if the fda determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim or if the fda determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific evidence or is otherwise false or misleading the claim could not be used and any product bearing the claim could be subject to regulatory action

the fda’s cgmp regulations govern the manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers as with otc products the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that the company’s dietary supplement facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representation made to customers or to regulatory action against the company related to the products made in that facility seizure 

 

injunction or recall there remains co nsiderable uncertainty with respect to the fda’s interpretation of the cgmp regulations and their actual implementation in manufacturing facilities the failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cgmp regulations may render products manufactur ed in that facility adulterated and subjects those products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential fda enforcement actions in addition under recent amendments to the fdca the manufacturing of dietary ingredients contained in dietary supplement s will be subject to similar or even more burdensome requirements which may increase the costs of dietary ingredients and subject suppliers of such ingredients to more rigorous inspections and enforcement the manufacturer packer or distributor of a di etary supplement marketed in the us whose name appears on the label of the supplement is required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of that supplement to the fda 

the ftc exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements the ftc considers whether a product’s advertising claims are accurate truthful and not misleading pursuant to its authority under the federal trade commission act or ftc act the ftc has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of otherwise false or misleading advertising claims these enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties andor restitution by the companies involved such actions can result in substantial financial penalties and significantly restrict the marketing of a dietary supplement

legislation may be introduced which if passed would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements the effect of additional domestic or international governmental legislation regulations or administrative orders if and when promulgated cannot be determined new legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards and require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation

risk factors  

tableend

the following risks and uncertainties as well as other factors described elsewhere in this annual report or in other filings by the company with the commission could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 



unfavorable and uncertain economic conditions have adversely affected and in the future may adversely affect demand for some of the categories of products the company sells resulting in reduced sales volume or market share or a shift in its product mix from higher margin to lower margin products factors that can affect demand include competitors’ products advertising and pricing actions rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior including delays in the timing of tax refunds from the federal government gasoline and home heating oil pricing reduced unemployment benefits in periods of high unemployment and tax increases while the vast majority of the company’s products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products they may become subject to increasing price competition moreover some of the company’s products such as laundry additives gummy dietary supplements and batteryoperated toothbrushes are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of the company’s customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs home stores and dollar pet and other specialty stores have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to the company on a timely basis or at all the company regularly reviews the financial strength of its key customers and where appropriate modifies customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales because the same economic conditions that affect the company also affect many of the company’s suppliers the company regularly conducts a similar review of its suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to the company’s operations when appropriate the company identifies alternate sources of materials and services to date the company has not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting its customers or suppliers however a protracted economic downturn that adversely affects the company’s suppliers and customers could adversely affect its sales and results of operations  



the company faces intense competition from consumer products companies both in the us and in international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widelyadvertised brands within each product category and with private label brands and generic nonbranded products of its customers in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers consumer products are subject to significant price competition as a result the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products or increase prices by an amount that does not cover manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices or inability to raise prices sufficiently to cover manufacturing cost increases would harm profit margins in addition if the company’s sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins its sales growth and other results of operations would suffer  

advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on retail customer decisions regarding the brands and product lines they sell and on consumer purchasing decisions a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs are not effective its sales growth may decline  

many of the company’s competitors are large companies including pg the sun products corporation the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson nestle purina petcare company ansell limited alere inc pfizer inc bayer ag sc johnson  son inc pharmavite llc and nbty inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than does the company and therefore have the capacity to outspend the company on advertising and promotional activities and introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than can the company in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by it competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced profits and adversely affect growth if the company loses market share or the markets in which it competes do not grow substantially its sales growth will decline  

 

· since the introduction in the us of unit dose laundry detergent by various manufacturers including the company there has been significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category for example pg markets a lowerpriced line of l aundry detergent s that competes directly with the company’s core value laundry detergents and henkel has entered the us market with persil its leading worldwide premium laundry detergent  while it is too early to assess what impact this will have on th e premium laundry category or the company’s laundry detergent business the introduction of persil could precipitate greater price competition in the category and distribution pressure with a potential adverse impact on oxiclean laundry detergent while t he category grew 16 in 2015 after experiencing declines in 2013 and 2014 there is no assurance the category will not decline in the future and that the company will be able to offset any such decline   



a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales walmart is the company’s largest customer accounting for approximately 24 of net sales in 2015 25 of net sales in 2014 and 24 of net sales in 2013 the company’s top three customers accounted for approximately 35 of net sales in 2015 36 of net sales in 2014 and 35 of net sales in 2013 the company expects that a significant portion of its net sales will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues as a result changes in the strategies of walmart or any of the company’s other largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or of shelf space they dedicate to private label products could materially harm the company’s net sales and profitability  in addition if the company were to lose a significant customer due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues this could also have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders as it rarely enters into longterm contracts with its customers and most customer agreements include customer termination rights after short notice accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations  



in recent years the company has seen increasing retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailer customers who may demand lower pricing special packaging or impose other requirements on the company these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship some of the company’s customers particularly its highvolume retail store customers have sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to the extent the company provides concessions or better trade terms to those customers its margins are reduced further if the company is unable to effectively respond to the demands of its customers these customers could reduce their purchases of company products and increase their purchases of products from competitors which would harm the company’s sales and profitability in addition reductions in inventory by the company’s customers including as a result of consolidations in the retail industry or these customers managing their working capital requirements could result in reduced orders for company products and adversely affect its results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions  

protracted unfavorable market conditions have caused many of the company’s customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell and reduce or discontinue certain of the company’s product lines particularly those products that were not number one or two in their category if this continues to occur and the company is unable to improve distribution for those products at other customers its results could be adversely affected  

in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains are typically sold at lower prices than branded products as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending the company’s customers have discontinued or reduced distribution of some of its products to encourage those consumers to purchase the customers’ less expensive private label products primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories to the extent customers discontinue or reduce distribution of the company’s products or these products are adversely affected by customers’ actions to increase shelf space for their private label products the company would seek to improve distribution with other customers however if the company’s efforts are not effective its sales growth and other results as well as its market share could be adversely affected 

 



the company’s performance depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and the financial difficulties of the company’s retailer customers consumer products such as those marketed by the company are increasingly being sold by club stores dollar stores mass merchandisers and internetbased retailers sales of the company’s products remain strongest in the traditional mass merchandiser food and drug retail stores and the company’s products are also being sold in club stores and dollar stores channels although the company has taken steps to improve and has seen improvement in sales to club stores dollar stores and internetbased retailers if the current trend continues and the company is not successful in further improving sales to these channels its financial condition and operating results could suffer  



a significant percentage of the company’s revenues come from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during 2015 approximately 83 of the company’s sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to the company’s most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes dietary supplements antiperspirants and deodorants the company’s ability to achieve unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of its products by consumers relative to competitors’ products its ability to drive growth through product innovation in existing and new product categories investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from its competitors if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that expand its product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its sales growth objectives even if the company is successful in increasing sales within its product categories a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for the company’s products could have a negative impact on its financial results 



the company initiates expansion projects from time to time the company expanded its gummy dietary supplements production capacity at its york pennsylvania manufacturing facility to meet expected future product demand the new gummy dietary supplements line started production in the second quarter of 2015 projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors including the following shortages of equipment materials or skilled labor work stoppages unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment unanticipated cost increases difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions difficulties in meeting regulatory or quality requirements or obtaining regulatory approvals availability of suppliers to certify equipment for existing and enhanced regulations design and engineering problems and failure or delay of third party service providers civil unrest and labor disputes significant cost overruns or delays in completing a project or the miscalculations of our anticipated capacity needs could have a material adverse effect on the company’s return on investment results of operations and cash flows in the second quarter of 2015 delays in the company’s startup of the new vitamin manufacturing facility resulted in the need to place certain retailers on allocation which contributed to increased retailer frustration by the end of the year these issues were mainly resolved however if the company were to experience similar issues in the future and lose a significant customer or customers or if sales of any of its products were to materially decrease due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues this could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally the supply of the company’s products depends on the uninterrupted efficient operation of its manufacturing facilities and ability to meet customer service levels many of the company’s manufacturing processes are complex and present difficult technical challenges to obtain the manufacturing yields necessary to operate profitably in addition the company’s manufacturing processes may require complex and specialized equipment which can be expensive to repair or replace with required lead times of up to a year

the manufacturing of certain of the company’s products is concentrated in one or more of its plants or contract manufacturers with limited alternate facilities any event that negatively impacts manufacturing facilities manufacturing systems or equipment or contract manufacturers or suppliers could delay or suspend shipments of products or the release of new products or could result in the delivery of inferior products the company’s revenues from the affected products would decline and it could incur losses until such time as the company or its contract manufacturers are able to restore production processes or are able to put in place alternative contract manufacturers or suppliers

 



the company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain of its commodities and raw materials including sole source suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers may have to be qualified under governmental industry and company standards which can require additional investment and time the company may be unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships it may be unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business or certain of the company’s key suppliers may become insolvent or experience other financial distress if any of these events occurs and the company has failed to identify and qualify an alternative vendor then it may be unable to meet its contractual obligations and customer expectations which could damage its reputation and result in lost customers and sales or the company may incur higher than expected expenses either of which could materially and adversely affect its business operations and results of operations  



the principal raw materials and packaging used by the company include surfactants cleaning agents paper products and resinbased molded components volatility and increases in the price of raw materials or increases in the costs of energy shipping and other necessary services could significantly affect the company’s profit margins if it is unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution historically the company has attempted to address such price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of its products entering into prebuying or lockedin pricing arrangements with certain suppliers and entering into hedge agreements there is no assurance however that the company will be able to fully offset any price increases especially given the competitive environment in addition volatility in certain commodity markets could significantly affect the company’s production cost and therefore harm its financial condition and operating results  

the company uses hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to product costs enabling the company to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in prices over the term of the contract however in periods of declining fuel prices the hedge agreements can have the effect of locking the company in at abovemarket prices  



the company’s future performance and growth depends on its ability to successfully identify develop and introduce new products and product line extensions the company cannot be certain that it will achieve its innovation goals the successful development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development marketing and promotional expenditures which the company may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays competitor actions regulatory approval hurdles and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of existing products the company’s financial performance could be harmed  

each year the company introduces new products including launches into new “white space” categories across the majority of its marketed brands historically new product acceptance has generally been widespread across the retailer base there is no assurance however that the company’s customers and consumers will continue to purchase these new products if new products are not successful in generating sales growth the company’s financial results could suffer from time to time the company has discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs the company may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent it discontinues products that do not meet retailer or consumer expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand  



we distribute our products and receive raw materials and packaging components primarily by truck rail and ship and through various ports of entry reduced availability of trucking rail or shipping capacity due to adverse weather conditions allocation of assets to other industries or geographies or otherwise work stoppages strikes or shutdowns of ports of entry or such transportation sources could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials or 

 

packaging components in a timely manner which could disrupt our operations strain our customer relationships and competitive position and adversely affect our operating profits 



the company’s financial success is directly dependent on the reputation and success of its brands particularly the arm  hammer oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion brands the effectiveness of these brands could suffer if the company’s marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further the company’s results could be adversely affected if one or more of its other leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality or safety issues  

additionally claims made in the company’s marketing campaigns may become subject to litigation alleging false advertising which if successful could cause the company to alter its marketing plans and may materially and adversely affect sales or result in the imposition of significant damages against the company or other customer or consumer dissatisfaction especially if such dissatisfaction were to be broadly disseminated including through the use of social media 

 

widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination negative or inaccurate posting or comments about the company in the media or on any social networking website or the disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information through social media could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands in addition given the association of our individual products with the company an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products or the company as a whole thereby potentially adversely impacting the company’s financial results 



from time to time the company is subject to product liability claims the company may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by its products including losses or injuries caused by raw materials or other components provided by third party suppliers that are included in the company’s products claims could be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants are improperly labeled or designed or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances whether or not successful product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s sales and operating results and the reputation of its brands in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective or noncompliant with applicable rules or regulations it could be required to withdraw or recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability and product recall insurance coverage that also covers product withdrawals potential product liability claims and withdrawal and recall costs may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition  



the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties the company has incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations for example the company currently is subject to environmental regulatory proceedings involving its brazilian subsidiary which has been fined the equivalent of approximately 10 million at current exchange rates and will continue remediation monitoring and reporting to the brazilian authorities it is possible that the company could become subject to other environmental remediation costs and liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition



 

the company in the ordinary course of its business is and from time to time may become the subject of or party to various pending or threatened legal actions government investigations and proceedings from time to time including without limitation those relating to commercial transactions product liability purported consumer class actions employment matters antitrust environmental health safety and other compliance related matters such proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of certain pending or threatened legal actions may not be reasonably predictable and any related damages may not be estimable certain pending or future legal actions for example the matter described under “item 3 legal proceedings  scantibodies laboratory inc” below could 

 

result in an adverse outcome for the company  and any such adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 



the manufacturing processing formulation including stability packaging labeling marketing distribution and sale of the company’s products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the ftc the epa and the cpsc in addition the company’s and its suppliers’ operations are subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board the company’s activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which its products are sold  

in particular the fda regulates the formulation safety manufacturing packaging labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits battery operated toothbrushes overthecounter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements including vitamins and minerals the fda also exercises oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of the company’s other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that the company and its suppliers use to manufacture regulated products and may identify compliance issues that would require the company and its suppliers to make certain changes in its manufacturing facilities and processes the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to regulatory action against the products made in that facility including seizure injunction or recall as well as to possible action against the owner of the facilitymanufacturer the company may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until the compliance issue has been remediated as a result the company’s business could be adversely affected  

likewise any future determination by the fda or a similar foreign agency or by the company in reviewing its compliance with applicable rules and regulations that the company’s products or quality systems do not comply with applicable regulations could result in future compliance activities including product withdrawals or recalls import detentions injunctions preventing the shipment of products or other enforcement actions for example the fda may determine that a particular claim that the company uses to support the marketing of a product is not substantiated may not accept the evidence of safety for a new product that the company may wish to market may challenge the safety or effectiveness of existing products based on among other things changes in formulations inadequate stability or “shelflife” consumer complaints or improper labeling and may determine that the company’s dietary supplement business manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations do not comply with cgmps similarly the company may identify these or other issues in internal compliance reviews of its operations and the operations and products of vendors and acquired companies these other issues may include the identification of contaminants or noncompliant levels of particular ingredients any of the foregoing could subject the company to adverse publicity force it to incur unanticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations  

in addition the commission has promulgated federally mandated rules regarding disclosure of the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold known as “conflict minerals” in products manufactured by public companies certain of the company’s products including its diagnostic test kits and spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrushes use these minerals sourced through third parties the new rules require the company to conduct due diligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo the drc or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the drc the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs to determine the origin of minerals used in its products in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of such minerals used in the company’s products also the company may face disqualification as a supplier for customers and reputational challenges or may need to discontinue supply from its suppliers if its due diligence procedures do not enable it to verify the origins for the minerals used in its products or determine that the minerals are conflict free  

from time to time congress the fda the ftc the commission or other federal state local or foreign legislative and regulatory authorities may impose additional laws or regulations that apply to the company repeal laws or regulations that the company considers favorable or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations the company is not able to predict the nature of such future laws regulations repeals or interpretations or to predict the effect additional governmental regulation when and if it occurs would have on its business in the future such developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated additional recordkeeping requirements increased documentation of the properties of certain products additional or different labeling additional scientific substantiation expanded adverse event reporting or other new requirements any such developments could increase the company’s costs significantly and could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations  

 



the company’s international operations subject it to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 



























these risks could have a significant impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position in all foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates it is subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions 



approximately 17 of the company’s net sales were to customers outside the us in 2015 the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk both transaction and translation with respect to its sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar outside of the us sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the canadian dollar euro pound brazilian real mexican peso chinese yuan and australian dollar a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which the company purchases materials and services in foreign markets although the company from time to time enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed intercompany sales or purchases denominated in the us dollar canadian dollar pound and euro  foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations   



the company’s ability to continue to grow its sales and profits is dependent on expanding in the locations in which it already does business and entering into new geographic locations both of which would require significant resources and investments which would affect the company’s risk profile the failure to successfully enter into or expand its business in such locations could materially affect the growth of the company’s business sales and results of operations

 



the company seeks to acquire or invest in businesses that offer products services or technologies that are complementary the company has made 10 acquisitions in the past 12 years including the following brands spinbrush batterypowered toothbrushes oxiclean kaboom and orange glo cleaning products orajel oral analgesics simply saline nasal moisturizers feline pine natural cat litter batiste dry shampoo l’il critters and vitafusion dietary supplements rephresh and replens feminine care products vi cor feed ingredients for dairy cows beef cattle poultry and other livestock and in january 2016 toppik a leading brand of hair building fibers for people with thinning hair the company acquired nine of its 10 power brands 

the company may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future however the company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive valuations obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions in recent periods competition from other consumer products companies that are seeking similar opportunities has been particularly strong and valuations for potential acquisition assets have been high which has placed pressure on the company’s ability to identify structure and execute transactions in addition all acquisitions and investments entail various risks including the difficulty of entering new markets or product categories the challenges of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of the company’s ongoing business and the ongoing business of the acquired company the need to review and if necessary upgrade processes of the acquired company to conform to the company’s own processes and applicable legal and regulatory requirements and generally the company’s potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment any of these risks may divert management and other resources require the company to incur unanticipated costs or delay the anticipated positive impact on the company’s business and results of the acquisition the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent the company acquires businesses that have standalone operations that cannot easily be integrated or operations or sources of supply outside of the us and canada for which products are manufactured locally by third parties these factors could harm the company’s financial condition and operating results  

acquired companies or operations or newlycreated ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made in addition future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the potentially dilutive issuances of new equity by the company or the incurrence of additional debt or contingent liabilities all of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and resources from other matters that are critical to the company’s operations

in recent years the banking system and financial markets have experienced severe disruption including among other things bank failures and consolidations severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades declines in asset valuations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these conditions present the following risks to the company among others



 





although the company believes that its operating cash flows together with its access to the credit markets provides it with significant discretionary funding capacity the inability of one or more institutions to fulfill funding obligations under the credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity and operations  



the company’s future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized if the actual amount of the company’s future taxable income is less than the amount it is currently projecting with respect to specific tax jurisdictions or if there is a change in the time period within which the deferred tax asset becomes deductible the company could be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets the recording of a valuation allowance would result in an increase in the company’s effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on its operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change the company’s deferred tax assets or liability balances which would have either a favorable or unfavorable impact on its effective tax rate  



significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions the company provides for uncertain tax positions with respect to tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards mandated by applicable accounting guidance fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact the company’s effective tax rate and its financial results the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities and although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company’s effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution

rights they may dilute the value of the company’s brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the company’s failure to perfect or successfully ass ert intellectual property rights could make it less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition also the company’s patents are granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent ap plication is filed while the company considers no single patent to be material to the business as a whole it does recognize that the loss of key patents will allow for increased competition specifically to its spinbrush batterypowered toothbrush firs t response pregnancy test kit and answer pregnancy test kit brands while the company has obtained and is seeking patent protection for improvements made in these product areas the company cannot provide assurance that its patents on such improvements wi ll offer the same level of protection from competition as the patents that are nearing the end of their 20 year terms and expiring  

in addition if the company’s products are found to infringe intellectual property rights of others the owners of those rights could bring legal actions against the company claiming substantial damages for past infringement and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products if these legal actions are successful in addition to any potential liability for damages from past infringement the company could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products potentially adding significant costs the company might not prevail in any action brought against it or it may be unsuccessful in securing any license for continued use and therefore have to discontinue the marketing and sale of a product this could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition

the company’s operations as well as the operations of its third party manufacturers suppliers and customers may be subject to disruption from a variety of causes including work stoppages material shortages financial difficulties acts of war terrorism pandemics fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business

strategic goals challenges and initiatives

the company’s ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for its products and retail customers’ decisions to carry its products which are in part affected by general economic conditions in its markets in 2015 many of the markets in which the company operates continued to experience general economic softness and weak or inconsistent consumer demand although the company’s consumer products generally are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products the continued economic downturn has reduced demand in many categories particularly those in personal care and affected company sales in recent periods some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category in addition an increasing portion of the company’s product categories are being sold by club stores dollar stores and mass merchandisers these customer actions have placed downward pressure on the company’s sales and gross margins

the company expects a competitive marketplace in 2016 due to new product introductions by competitors and continuing aggressive competitive pricing pressures in the us an improving unemployment rate and higher disposable income due to low gasoline prices are expected to have a positive effect on consumption patterns to continue to deliver attractive results for stockholders in this environment the company intends to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives maintain competitive marketing and trade spending tightly control its cost structure continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursue strategic acquisitions the company also intends to continue to grow its product sales geographically in an attempt to mitigate the impact of weakness in any one area and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products to appeal to a wide range of consumers

the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain product categories from other larger multinational competitors some of which have greater resources such activities have included new product introductions more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending since the introduction in the us of unit dose laundry detergent by various manufacturers including the company there has been significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category for example pg one of the company’s major competitors and the market leader in laundry detergent markets a lowerpriced line of laundry detergents that competes directly with the company’s core value laundry detergents additionally henkel has entered the us market with persil its leading worldwide premium laundry detergent while it is too early to assess what impact this will have on the premium laundry category or the company’s laundry detergent business the introduction of persil could precipitate greater price competition in the category and distribution pressure with a potential adverse impact on oxiclean laundry detergent the company continues to evaluate and vigorously combat the pressures in the laundry detergent category through among other things new product introductions and increased marketing spending while the category grew 16 in 2015 after experiencing declines in 2013 and 2014 there is no assurance the category will not decline and that the company will be able to offset any such decline

the company has responded to these competitive pressures by among other things focusing on strengthening its key brands including increased focus on the arm  hammer oxiclean trojan and l’il critters and vitafusion mega brands through the launch of innovative new products which span various product categories including premium and value household products supported by increased marketing and trade spending together they represented approximately 60 of the company’s sales and profits in 2015 these mega brands have advantages over other power brands including the ability to leverage research and development and marketing investments and lower overhead costs across mega brand categories for example the company’s 2014 responsive product introductions include the simultaneous launch of oxiclean branded products into the midpremium tier laundry detergent segment and auto dish detergent category and bleach alternatives with continued support of and innovation in the company’s base arm  hammer and oxiclean businesses to create scale and maximize marketing efforts in 2015 the company continued to heavily invest in the oxiclean brand as 2015 marked the second year of the company’s goal to establish oxiclean as a mega brand in multiple categories mega brand launches and launches of other products are anticipated to contribute more incremental new product revenue than the introduction of new products has in prior years and a significant portion of those revenues will include expansion into new categories with premium household products supported by increased levels of slotting trade promotions and incremental marketing support and planned ongoing technology investment there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 

despite challenging economic conditions and customer responses to these conditions the company was able to grow market share in seven of 10 of its “power brands” in 2015 including in the laundry detergent category the company’s global product portfolio consists of both premium 60 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2015 and value 40 of total worldwide consumer

revenue in 2015  brands which it believes enables it to succeed in a range of economic environments the company’s value brands have performed strongly during economic downturns and the company intends to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among costconscious consumers 

over the past 15 years the company has diversified from an almost exclusively us business to a global company with approximately 15 of sales derived from foreign countries in 2015 the company has operations in six countries canada mexico uk france australia and brazil and exports to over 90 other countries in 2015 the company benefited from its concentration in north america in light of the economic downturn in europe however the company has continued and will continue to focus on selectively expanding its global business net sales generated outside of the united states are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as political uncertainty which could impact future operating results 

the company also continues to focus on controlling its costs historically the company has been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent by passing along some of these cost increases to customers the company has also entered into set pricing and prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel additionally maintaining tight controls on overhead costs has been a hallmark of the company and has enabled it to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions 

the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of the company’s overall strategy acquisitions have added significantly to company sales and profits over the last decade this is evidenced by the lil’ drug store brands and vicor acquisitions however the failure to effectively integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause the company to incur material asset writedowns the company actively seeks acquisitions that fit its guidelines and its strong financial position provides it with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in addition the company’s ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled it to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions since 2001 the company has acquired nine of its ten “power brands” 

the company believes it is positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives maintaining competitive marketing and trade spending managing its cost structure continuing to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursuing strategic acquisitions this focus together with the strength of the company’s portfolio of premium and value brands has enabled the company to succeed in a range of economic environments  and is expected to position the company to continue to increase stockholder value over the longterm moreover the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations as a result of net income and effective working capital management combined with an investment grade credit rating provides the company with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions drive new product development make capital expenditures to support organic growth and gross margin improvements return cash to stockholders through dividends and share buy backs and reduce outstanding debt positioning it to continue to create stockholder value

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty they are based on the company’s historical experience its observation of trends in industry information provided by its customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate the company’s significant accounting policies and estimates are described below 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves

virtually all of the company’s revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by the company’s customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on the company’s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company’s products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements an approximately 48 difference in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns the company uses experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if the company’s estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 58 while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 the company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately 43 67 and 37 respectively based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information these adjustments are immaterial relative to the amount of trade promotion expense incurred annually by the company 

impairment of goodwill trade names and other intangible assets 

carrying values of goodwill trade names and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment  for finite intangible assets the company assesses business triggering events the company’s impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trade names and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired the result of the company’s annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units in addition there were no goodwill impairment charges for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2015

the company recognized intangible asset impairment charges within sga for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2015 as follows

the impairment charges recorded in 201 4 and 201 3 were a result of actual and projected reductions in sales and profitability as a result of increased competition the amount of the impairment charges was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the assets to their carrying amount fair value was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” or “excess earnings” discounted cash flow method which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change and therefore could impact fair values in the future the company determined that the fair value of all other intangible assets as of december 31 2015 exceeded their respective carrying values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability  i n 201 4  the results of the company ’s annual impairment test for indef inite lived trade names resulted in a personal care trade name whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by 11 in 2015 the fair value of this asset exceeded its carrying value by approximately 20 based on improved and forecasted performance this trade name ’s carrying value is valued at approximately 37 0 as of december 31 2015 and is considered an important asset to the company the company continues to monitor performance and should there be any significant change in forecasted assumptions o r estimates including sales  profitability and discount rate the company may be required to recognize an impairment charge

the company competes in the household and personal care consumer product categories which are highly innovative categories characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and require significant advertising and promotion the company competes in these categories primarily on the basis of product innovation and performance brand recognition price value and other consumer benefits consumer products particularly laundry and household cleaning products as well as certain toothpaste products are subject to significant price competition as a result the company from time to time may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share

generally dietary ingredients that were marketed in the us prior to october 15 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the fda “new” dietary ingredients  ie dietary ingredients that were not marketed in the us before october 15 1994 must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the fda at least 75 days before the initial marketing unless the ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for food without being chemically altered a new dietary ingredient notification must provide evidence of a history of use or other evidence establishing that use of the dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe the fda may determine that a new dietary ingredient notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe such a determination could effectively prevent the marketing of the dietary ingredient on july 5 2011 the fda issued draft guidance governing notification of new dietary ingredients the draft guidance was issued for public comment and not for implementation to date the fda has not taken any further steps towards implementing the guidance the guidance if implemented could effectively change the status of dietary ingredients that the industry has marketed as “old” dietary ingredients to “new” dietary ingredients that may require submission of a new dietary ingredient notification  

the fdca permits “statements of nutritional support” to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without fda premarket approval the fda must be notified of those statements within 30 days of marketing among other things the statements may describe the role of a dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function of the body or characterize the documented mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient maintains such structure or function but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose cure mitigate treat or prevent a disease a company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess information substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading if the fda determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim or if the fda determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific evidence or is otherwise false or misleading the claim could not be used and any product bearing the claim could be subject to regulatory action

the fda’s cgmp regulations govern the manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers as with otc products the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that the company’s dietary supplement facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representation made to customers or to regulatory action against the company related to the products made in that facility seizure injunction or recall there remains considerable uncertainty with respect to the fda’s interpretation of the cgmp regulations and their actual implementation in manufacturing facilities the failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cgmp regulations 

 

may render products manufactured in that facility adulterated and subjects those products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential fda enforcement actions in addition under recent amendments to the fdca the manufacturing of dietary ingredients contained in dietary supplements will be subject to similar or even more burdensome requirements which may increase the costs of dietary ingredients and subject suppliers of such ingredients to more rigorous inspections and enforcement the manufacturer packer or distributor of a dietary supplement marketed in the us whose name appears on the label of the supplement is required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of that supplement to the fda

the ftc exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements the ftc considers whether a product’s advertising claims are accurate truthful and not misleading pursuant to its authority under the federal trade commission act or ftc act the ftc has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of otherwise false or misleading advertising claims these enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties andor restitution by the companies involved such actions can result in substantial financial penalties and significantly restrict the marketing of a dietary supplement

legislation may be introduced which if passed would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements the effect of additional domestic or international governmental legislation regulations or administrative orders if and when promulgated cannot be determined new legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards and require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation

risk factors 

tableend

the following risks and uncertainties as well as others described elsewhere in this annual report could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 



unfavorable and uncertain economic conditions have adversely affected and in the future may adversely affect demand for some of the categories of products the company sells resulting in reduced sales volume or market share or a shift in its product mix from higher margin to lower margin products factors that can affect demand include competitors’ products advertising and pricing actions rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior including delays in the timing of tax refunds from the federal government gasoline and home heating oil pricing reduced unemployment benefits in periods of high unemployment and tax increases while the vast majority of the company’s products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products they may become subject to increasing price competition moreover some of the company’s products such as laundry additives gummy dietary supplements and batteryoperated toothbrushes are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of the company’s customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs home stores and dollar pet and other specialty stores have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to the company on a timely basis or at all the company regularly reviews the financial strength of its key customers and where appropriate modifies customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales because the same economic conditions that affect the company also affect many of the company’s suppliers the company regularly conducts a similar review of its suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to the company’s operations when appropriate the company identifies alternate sources of materials and services to date the company has not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting its customers or suppliers however a protracted economic downturn that adversely affects the company’s suppliers and customers could adversely affect its sales and results of operations  



the company faces intense competition from consumer products companies both in the us and in international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widelyadvertised brands within each product category and with private label brands and generic nonbranded products of its customers in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers consumer products are subject to significant price competition as a result the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products or increase prices by an amount that does not cover manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices or inability to raise prices sufficiently to cover manufacturing cost increases would harm profit margins in addition if the company’s sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins its sales growth and other results of operations would suffer  

advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on retail customer decisions regarding the brands and product lines they sell and on consumer purchasing decisions a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs are not effective its sales growth may decline  

many of the company’s competitors are large companies including pg the sun products corporation the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel ag  co kgaa reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson nestle purina petcare company ansell limited alere inc pfizer inc bayer ag sc johnson  son inc pharmavite llc and nbty inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than does the company and therefore have the capacity to outspend the company on advertising and promotional activities and introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than can the company in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by it competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced profits and adversely affect growth if the company loses market share or the markets in which it competes do not grow substantially its sales growth will decline  

 

since the 2012 introduction in the us of unit dose laundry detergent by various manufacturers including the company there has been significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category contributing to an overall category decline during 2012 2013 and 2014 the category declined 06 an additional 32 and an additional 29 respectively in 2014 pg the market leader in premium laundry detergent including unit dose laundry detergent reconfigured certain of its product offerings and related marketing and pricing strategies and launched various products to compete more directly with the company’s core arm  hammer xtra and oxiclean power brands specifically pg launched lowerpriced laundry detergents to compete directly with the company’s core value laundry detergents and has launched a versatile stain remover to compete with the company’s prewash additive oxiclean supported by aggressive trade spending and marketing these actions and price competition could negatively impact the company’s laundry detergent and versatile stain remover businesses 



a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales walmart is the company’s largest customer accounting for approximately 25 of net sales in 2014 24 of net sales in 2013 and 24 of net sales in 2012 the company’s top three customers accounted for approximately 36 of net sales in 2014 35 of net sales in 2013 and 34 of net sales in 2012 the company expects that a significant portion of its net sales will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues as a result changes in the strategies of walmart or any of the company’s other largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or of shelf space they dedicate to private label products could materially harm the company’s net sales and profitability  

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders as it rarely enters into longterm contracts with its customers and most customer agreements include customer termination rights after short notice accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations  



in recent years the company has seen increasing retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailer customers who may demand lower pricing special packaging or impose other requirements on the company these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship some of the company’s customers particularly its highvolume retail store customers have sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to the extent the company provides concessions or better trade terms to those customers its margins are reduced further if the company is unable to effectively respond to the demands of its customers these customers could reduce their purchases of company products and increase their purchases of products from competitors which would harm the company’s sales and profitability in addition reductions in inventory by the company’s customers including as a result of consolidations in the retail industry or these customers managing their working capital requirements could result in reduced orders for company products and adversely affect its results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions  

protracted unfavorable market conditions have caused many of the company’s customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell and reduce or discontinue certain of the company’s product lines particularly those products that were not number one or two in their category if this continues to occur and the company is unable to improve distribution for those products at other customers its results could be adversely affected  

in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains are typically sold at lower prices than branded products as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending the company’s customers have discontinued or reduced distribution of some of its products to encourage those consumers to purchase the customers’ less expensive private label products primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories to the extent customers discontinue or reduce distribution of the company’s products or these products are adversely affected by customers’ actions to increase shelf space for their private label products the company would seek to improve distribution with other customers however if the company’s efforts are not effective its sales growth and other results as well as its market share could be adversely affected 



the company’s performance depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and the financial difficulties of the company’s retailer customers consumer products such as those marketed by the company are increasingly being sold by club stores dollar stores and mass 

 

merchandisers sales of the company’s products remain strongest in the mass merchandiser food and drug channels of trade and the company’s products are also being sold in the club stores and dollar stores channels although the company has taken steps to improve and has seen improvement in sales to club stores and dollar stores if the current trend continues and the company is not successful in further improving sales to these channels its financial condition and operating results could suffer  



a significant percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during 2014 approximately 80 of the company’s sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to the company’s most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes dietary supplements antiperspirants and deodorants the company’s ability to achieve unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of its products by consumers relative to competitors’ products its ability to drive growth through product innovation in existing and new product categories investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from its competitors if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that expand its product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its sales growth objectives even if the company is successful in increasing sales within its product categories a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for the company’s products could have a negative impact on its financial results 



the company initiates expansion projects from time to time for example the company is currently expanding its gummy dietary supplements production capacity at its york pennsylvania manufacturing facility to meet expected future product demand the new gummy dietary supplements line is expected to start production in the first quarter of 2015 projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors including the following shortages of equipment materials or skilled labor work stoppages unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment unanticipated cost increases difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions difficulties in meeting regulatory requirements or obtaining regulatory approvals availability of suppliers to certify equipment for existing and enhanced regulations design and engineering problems and failure or delay of third party service providers civil unrest and labor disputes significant cost overruns or delays in completing a project could have a material adverse effect on the company’s return on investment results of operations and cash flows in addition if the company miscalculates its anticipated capacity needs this too could negatively impact its operations financial condition and results of operations  



the company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain of its commodities and raw materials including sole source suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers may have to be qualified under governmental industry and company standards which can require additional investment and time the company may be unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships it may be unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business or certain of the company’s key suppliers may become insolvent or experience other financial distress if any of these events occurs and the company has failed to identify and qualify an alternative vendor then it may be unable to meet its contractual obligations and customer expectations which could damage its reputation and result in lost customers and sales or the company may incur higher than expected expenses either of which could materially and adversely affect its business operations and results of operations  



the principal raw materials and packaging used by the company include surfactants cleaning agents paper products and resinbased molded components volatility and increases in the price of raw materials or increases in the costs of energy shipping and other necessary services could significantly affect the company’s profit margins if it is unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution historically the company has attempted to address such price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of its products entering into prebuying or lockedin pricing arrangements with certain suppliers and entering into hedge agreements there is no assurance however that the company will be able to fully offset any price increases especially given the competitive environment in addition volatility 

 

in certain commodity markets could significantly affect the company’s production cost and therefore harm its financial condition and operating results 

the company uses hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to product costs enabling the company to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in prices over the term of the contract however in periods of declining fuel prices the hedge agreements can have the effect of locking the company in at abovemarket prices  



the company’s future performance and growth depends on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product line extensions the company cannot be certain that it will achieve its innovation goals the successful development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development marketing and promotional expenditures which the company may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays competitor actions regulatory approval hurdles and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of existing products the company’s financial performance could be harmed  

for example the company has been launching more new products into “white space” categories than it has historically in 2014 the company expanded the oxiclean brand into three additional categories premium laundry detergent dishwashing detergent and bleach alternatives in addition the company launched new products across almost all of its core businesses including a premium clumping cat litter called arm  hammer clump  seal a new premium toothpaste called arm  hammer truly radiant a new vitamin line for the vitafusion brand and new condoms vibrators and lubricants under the trojan brand while most of these new products have received strong distribution acceptance from the company’s retailers to date and will be supported by increased marketing spending there is no assurance that the company’s customers and consumers will continue to purchase these new products if these new products are not successful in gaining market share the company’s financial results could suffer 

from time to time the company has discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs the company may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent it discontinues products that do not meet expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand  



we distribute our products and receive raw materials and packaging components primarily by truck rail and ship and through various ports of entry reduced availability of trucking rail or shipping capacity due to adverse weather conditions allocation of assets to other industries or geographies or otherwise work stoppages strikes or shutdowns of ports of entry or such transportation sources could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials or packaging components in a timely manner which could disrupt our operations strain our customer relationships and competitive position and adversely affect our operating profits



the company’s financial success is directly dependent on the reputation and success of its brands particularly the arm  hammer oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion brands the effectiveness of these brands could suffer if the company’s marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further the company’s results could be adversely affected if one or more of its other leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality or safety issues  

additionally claims made in the company’s marketing campaigns may become subject to litigation alleging false advertising which if successful could cause the company to alter its marketing plans and may materially and adversely affect sales or result in the imposition of significant damages against the company or other customer or consumer dissatisfaction especially if such dissatisfaction were to be broadly disseminated including through the use of social media 

 

widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination negative or inaccurate posting or comments about the company in the media or on any social networking website or the disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information through social media could generate adverse publicity that 

 

could damage the reputation of our brands in addition given the association of our individual products with the company an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products or the company as a whole thereby potentially adversely impacting the company’s financial results 



from time to time the company is subject to product liability claims the company may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by its products including losses or injuries caused by raw materials or other components provided by third party suppliers that are included in the company’s products claims could be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants are improperly labeled or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances whether or not successful product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s sales and operating results and the reputation of its brands in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective or noncompliant with applicable rules or regulations it could be required to withdraw or recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability and product recall insurance coverage that also covers product withdrawals potential product liability claims and withdrawal and recall costs may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition  



the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties the company has incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations the company currently is subject to environmental regulatory proceedings involving its brazilian subsidiary which has been fined the equivalent of approximately 19 million at current exchange rates in the proceedings the brazilian subsidiary is contesting the fine in addition the company may be required to remove certain landfills in brazil in connection with these proceedings the cost of which is estimated to be in the range of 30 million to 50 million it is possible that the company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future particularly with respect to its operations in brazil that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition  



the manufacturing processing formulation including stability packaging labeling marketing distribution and sale of the company’s products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the ftc the epa and the cpsc in addition the company’s and its suppliers’ operations are subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board the company’s activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which its products are sold  

in particular the fda regulates the formulation safety manufacturing packaging labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits battery operated toothbrushes overthecounter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements including vitamins and minerals the fda also exercises oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of the company’s other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that the company and its suppliers use to manufacture regulated products and may identify compliance issues that would require the company and its suppliers to make certain changes in its manufacturing facilities and processes the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to regulatory action against the products made in that facility including seizure injunction or recall as well as to possible action against the owner of the facilitymanufacturer the company may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until the compliance issue has been remediated as a result the company’s business could be adversely affected  

likewise any future determination by the fda or a similar foreign agency or by the company in reviewing its compliance with applicable rules and regulations that the company’s products or quality systems do not comply with applicable regulations could result in future compliance activities including product withdrawals or recalls import detentions injunctions preventing the shipment of products or other enforcement actions for example the fda may determine that a particular claim that the company uses to support the marketing of a product is not substantiated may not accept the evidence of safety for a new product that the company may 

 

wish to market may challenge the safety or effectiveness of existing products based on among other things changes in formulations inadequate stability or “shelflife” consumer complaints or improper labeling and may determine that the company’s dietary supplement business manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations do not comply with cgmps similarly the company may identify these or other issues in internal compliance reviews of its operations and the operations and products of vendors and acquired companies these other issues may include the identification of contaminants or noncompliant levels of particular ingredients any of the foregoing could subject the company to adverse publicity force it to incur unanticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations

in addition the commission has promulgated final rules mandated by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold known as “conflict minerals” in products manufactured by public companies certain of the company’s products including its diagnostic test kits and spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrushes use these minerals sourced through third parties the new rules require the company to conduct due diligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo the drc or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the drc the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs to determine the origin of minerals used in its products in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of such minerals used in the company’s products also the company may face disqualification as a supplier for customers and reputational challenges or may need to discontinue supply from its suppliers if its due diligence procedures do not enable it to verify the origins for the minerals used in its products or determine that the minerals are conflict free  

from time to time congress the fda the ftc the commission or other federal state local or foreign legislative and regulatory authorities may impose additional laws or regulations that apply to the company repeal laws or regulations that the company considers favorable or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations the company is not able to predict the nature of such future laws regulations repeals or interpretations or to predict the effect additional governmental regulation when and if it occurs would have on its business in the future such developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated additional recordkeeping requirements increased documentation of the properties of certain products additional or different labeling additional scientific substantiation expanded adverse event reporting or other new requirements any such developments could increase the company’s costs significantly and could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations  



the company’s international operations subject it to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 

























these risks could have a significant impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position in all foreign 

 

jurisdictions in which the company operates it is subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions 

in addition the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar outside of the us sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the canadian dollar euro british pound brazilian real mexican peso chinese yuan and australian dollar a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow the company from time to time enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed intercompany sales or purchases denominated in the us dollar canadian dollar british pound and euro  



the company seeks to acquire or invest in businesses that offer products services or technologies that are complementary the company has made nine acquisitions in the past twelve years including the following brands spinbrush batterypowered toothbrushes oxiclean kaboom and orange glo cleaning products orajel oral analgesics simply saline nasal moisturizers feline pine natural cat litter batiste dry shampoo l’il critters and vitafusion dietary supplements rephresh and replens feminine care products and in january 2015 vi cor a manufacturer and seller of feed ingredients for dairy cows beef cattle poultry and other livestock 

the company may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future however the company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive valuations obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions in addition all acquisitions and investments entail various risks including the difficulty of entering new markets or product categories the challenges of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of the company’s ongoing business and the ongoing business of the acquired company the need to review and if necessary upgrade processes of the acquired company to conform to the company’s own processes and applicable legal and regulatory requirements and generally the company’s potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment any of these risks may divert management and other resources require the company to incur unanticipated costs or delay the anticipated positive impact on the company’s business and results of the acquisition the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent the company acquires businesses that have standalone operations that cannot easily be integrated or operations or sources of supply outside of the us and canada for which products are manufactured locally by third parties these factors could harm the company’s financial condition and operating results  

acquired companies or operations or newlycreated ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made in addition future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the potentially dilutive issuances of new equity by the company or the incurrence of additional debt or contingent liabilities all of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and resources from other matters that are critical to the company’s operations  



the company relies extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to conduct its business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to internal communications and communications with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers billing customers and receiving and applying payment processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements collecting and storing customer consumer employee investor and other stakeholder information and personal data and other processes necessary to manage the company’s business in addition the company is engaged in limited ecommerce with respect to its trojan brand

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of the information technology systems networks and services of the company its customers and other business partners as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data of the company its customers and other business partners as a result the company’s information technology systems networks or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or the company could suffer a loss or disclosure of business personal or stakeholder information due to 

 

any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages and security breaches although the company has business continuity plans in place and is in process of implementing a breach response plan to address service interruptions if these plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct its operations which may adversely affect its business the company may need to expend additional resources in the future to continue to protect against or to address problems caused by any business interruptions or data security breaches 

any business interruptions or data security breaches including cyber security breaches resulting in private data disclosure could result in lawsuits or regulatory proceedings damage the company’s reputation or adversely impact the company’s results of operations and cash flows 



as of december 31 2014 the company had approximately 1095 million of total consolidated indebtedness this amount of indebtedness could have important consequences including











in addition the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify any decision regarding future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time including market conditions and the company’s credit rating  



the company’s ability to repay and refinance its indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends primarily on its cash flow cash flow is often subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond the company’s control and such factors may limit its ability to repay indebtedness and fund capital expenditures a failure to service its indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition  



although the board has recently authorized new share repurchase programs and recently increased the amount of the quarterly cash dividends payable on the common stock any board determinations to continue to repurchase the common stock or to continue to pay cash dividends on the common stock in each case at levels consistent with recent practice or at all will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations business requirements price of the common stock in the case of the repurchase programs and the board’s continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of company stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event the company does not declare a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases its stock price could be adversely affected  

 



in recent years the banking system and financial markets have experienced severe disruption including among other things bank failures and consolidations severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades declines in asset valuations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these conditions present the following risks to the company among others





although the company believes that its operating cash flows together with its access to the credit markets provides it with significant discretionary funding capacity the inability of one or more institutions to fulfill funding obligations under the credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity and operations  



the company’s future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized if the actual amount of the company’s future taxable income is less than the amount it is currently projecting with respect to specific tax jurisdictions or if there is a change in the time period within which the deferred tax asset becomes deductible the company could be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets the recording of a valuation allowance would result in an increase in the company’s effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on its operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change the company’s deferred tax assets or liability balances which would have either a favorable or unfavorable impact on its effective tax rate  



significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions the company provides for uncertain tax positions with respect to tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards mandated by applicable accounting guidance fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact the company’s effective tax rate and its financial results the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities and although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company’s effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution  



the market for the company’s products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with its trademarks and brand names including arm  hammer trojan oxiclean l’il critters and vitafusion the company owns the material trademarks and brand names used in connection with the marketing and distribution of its major products both in the us and in other countries in addition the company holds several valuable patents on its products which the company believes serve as an effective barrier to entry for new competitors accordingly the company relies on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property rights although most of the company’s material intellectual property is registered in the us and 

 

in certain foreign countries in which it operates it cannot be sure that its intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or if necessary successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of the company’s brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the company’s failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make it less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition also the company’s patents are granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed while the company considers no single patent to be material to the business as a whole it does recognize that the loss of key patents will allow for increased competition specifically to its spinbrush batterypowered toothbrush first response pregnancy test kit and answer pregnancy test kit brands while the company has obtained and is seeking patent protection for improvements made in these product areas the company cannot provide assurance that its patents on such improvements will offer the same level of protection from competition as the patents that are nearing the end of their 20 year terms and expiring

in addition if the company’s products are found to infringe intellectual property rights of others the owners of those rights could bring legal actions against the company claiming substantial damages for past infringement and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products if these legal actions are successful in addition to any potential liability for damages from past infringement the company could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products potentially adding significant costs the company might not prevail in any action brought against it or it may be unsuccessful in securing any license for continued use and therefore have to discontinue the marketing and sale of a product this could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition  



the company has a material amount of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets as well as other longlived assets which are periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards declines in the company’s profitability andor estimated cash flows related to specific intangible assets as well as potential changes in market valuations for similar assets and market discount rates has resulted in impairment charges from time to time and may result in future impairment charges which could reduce the company’s net income and otherwise have an adverse impact on operating results in 2014 the results of the company’s annual impairment test for indefinite lived trade names resulted in a personal care trade name whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by 11 this trade name is valued at approximately 37 million and is considered an important asset to the company the company continues to monitor performance and should there be any significant change in forecasted assumptions or estimates including sales profitability and discount rate the company may be required to recognize an impairment charge 



the company’s operations as well as the operations of its third party manufacturers suppliers and customers may be subject to disruption from a variety of causes including work stoppages material shortages financial difficulties acts of war terrorism pandemics fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business  



the company’s future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business prospects financial condition and results of operations this effect could be exacerbated if any officers or other key personnel left as a group or at the same time the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future

brazil environmental matters 

in 2000 the company acquired majority ownership in its brazilian subsidiary quimica geral do nordeste sa “qgn” the acquired operations included an inorganic salt manufacturing plant which began site operations in the late 1970’s located on the site were two closed landfills two active landfills and a pond for the management of the process waste streams in 2009 qgn was advised by the environmental authority in the state of bahia the institute of the environment “ima” that the plant was discharging contaminants into an adjacent creek after learning of the discharge qgn took immediate action to cease the discharge and retained two nationally recognized environmental firms to prepare a site investigation  remedial action plan “sira” the sira report was submitted by qgn to ima in april 2010 the report concluded that the likely sources of the discharge were the failure of the pond and closed landfills qgn ceased site operations in august 2010 in november 2010 ima responded to qgn’s recommendation for an additional study by issuing a notification requiring a broad range of remediation measures the “remediation notification” which included the shutdown and removal of two onsite landfills in addition despite repeated discussions with ima at qgn’s request to consider qgn’s proposed remediation alternatives in december 2010 ima imposed a fine of five million brazilian real approximately us 19 million at current exchange rates for the discharge of contaminants above allowable limits the description of the fine included a reference to aggravating factors that may indicate that local “management’s intent” was considered in determining the severity of the fine which could result in criminal liability for members of local management in january 2011 qgn filed with ima an administrative defense to the fine suspending any enforcement activities pending its defense ima has not yet formally responded to qgn’s administrative defense  

with respect to the remediation notification qgn engaged in discussions with ima during which qgn asserted that a number of the remediation measures including the removal of the landfills and the timeframes for implementation were not appropriate and requested that the remediation notification be withdrawn in response in february 2011 ima issued a revised remediation notification the “revised remediation notification” providing for further site analysis by qgn including further study of the integrity of the landfills the revised remediation notification did not include a requirement to remove the landfills however it did not foreclose the possibility of such requirement qgn has responded to the revised remediation notification providing further information regarding the remediation measures and is in discussions with the institute of environment and waste management “inema” successor to ima to seek agreement on an appropriate remediation plan in mid2011 qgn consistent with the revised remediation notice began an additional site investigation and capped the two active landfills in 2012 qgn drained the waste pond during the third quarter of 2013 inema approved in writing the first step in qgn’s proposed remediation plans the installation of a trench drain to capture and treat groundwater at the site construction of the trench drain began during the first quarter of 2014 and is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2015 in june 2014 qgn formally submitted to inema a technical report including a remediation plan for the site and a proposed agreement regarding the fine and qgn’s ongoing obligations at the site in july 2014 an initial meeting was held with inema to review and discuss the report and the proposed 

 

agreement following the initial meeting qgn provided additional information requested by inema and continues to engage in discussions with inema regarding the proposed agreement 

as a result of the foregoing events the company accrued approximately 30 million in 2009 and 48 million in 2010 for remediation fines and related costs since 2009 the costs of remediation activities and foreign exchange rate changes have reduced the accrual by approximately 47 million to a current amount of 31 million as a result of inema’s approval of the first step in qgn’s remediation plans the company does not believe that it will be required to remove the landfills however it remains reasonably possible that inema will require such removal and the company could be unsuccessful in appealing such decision the company estimates the cost of such landfill removal would be in the range of 30 million to 50 million

2014 financial highlights 

key fiscal year 2014 financial results include













strategic goals challenges and initiatives

the company’s ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for its products and retail customers’ decisions to carry its products which are in part affected by general economic conditions in its markets in 2014 many of the markets in which the 

church  dwight co inc and subsidiaries

dollars in millions except share and per share data

 

company operates continued to experience general economic softness and weak or inconsistent consumer demand although the company’s consumer products generally are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products the continued economic downturn has reduced demand in many categories particularly those in personal care and affected company sales in recent periods some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category in addition an increasing portion of the company’s product categories are being sold by club stores dollar stores and mass merchandisers these customer actions have placed downward pressure on the company’s sales and gross margins

the company expects a competitive marketplace in 2015 due to new product introductions by competitors and continuing aggressive competitive pricing pressures in the us an improving unemployment rate and higher disposable income due to low gasoline prices are expected to have a positive effect on consumption patterns in the second half of 2015 to continue to deliver attractive results for stockholders in this environment the company intends to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives maintain competitive marketing and trade spending tightly control its cost structure continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursue strategic acquisitions the company also intends to continue to grow its product sales geographically in an attempt to mitigate the impact of weakness in any one area and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products to appeal to a wide range of consumers

the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain product categories from other larger multinational competitors some of which have greater resources such activities have included new product introductions more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending since the 2012 introduction in the us of unit dose laundry detergent by various manufacturers including the company there has been significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category contributing to an overall category decline during 2012 2013 and 2014 the category declined by 06 32 and 29 respectively 

in 2014 pg one of the company’s major competitors and the market leader in premium laundry detergent including unit dose laundry detergent reconfigured certain of its product offerings and related marketing and pricing strategies and launched various products to compete more directly with the company’s core arm  hammer xtra and oxiclean power brands for example pg launched a lowerpriced line of laundry detergents to compete directly with the company’s core value laundry detergents and launched a versatile stain remover to compete with oxiclean the company’s prewash additive 

the company responded to these competitive pressures by among other things focusing on strengthening its key brands including increased focus on the arm  hammer oxiclean trojan and l’il critters and vitafusion mega brands which each span various product categories including premium and value household products and represented approximately 60 of the company’s sales and profits in 2014 through the launch of innovative new products and strong sales execution supported by increased marketing and trade spending these mega brands have advantages over other power brands including the ability to leverage research and development and marketing investments and lower overhead costs across mega brand categories for example the company’s 2014 responsive product introductions include the simultaneous launch of oxiclean branded products into the midpremium tier laundry detergent segment and auto dish detergent category and bleach alternatives with continued support of and innovation in the company’s base arm hammer and oxiclean businesses to create scale and maximize marketing efforts in 2015 the company intends to continue to heavily invest in the oxiclean brand as 2015 marks the second year of the company’s goal to establish oxiclean as a mega brand in multiple categories mega brand launches and launches of other products are anticipated to contribute more incremental new product revenue than the introduction of new products has in prior years and a significant portion of those revenues will include expansion into new categories with premium household products supported by increased levels of slotting trade promotions and incremental marketing support and planned ongoing technology investment there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 

despite challenging economic conditions and customer responses to these conditions the company was able to grow market share in six of nine of its “power brands” in 2014 including in the laundry detergent category the company’s global product portfolio consists of both premium 60 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2014 and value 40 of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2014 brands which it believes enables it to succeed in a range of economic environments the company’s value brands have performed strongly during economic downturns and the company intends to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among costconscious consumers

over the past 15 years the company has diversified from an almost exclusively us business to a global company with approximately 16 of sales derived from foreign countries in 2014 the company has operations in six countries canada mexico uk france australia and brazil and exports to over 90 other countries in 2014 the company benefited from its concentration in north america in light of the economic downturn in europe however the company has continued and will continue to focus on

selectively expanding its global business net sales generated outside of the united states are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as political uncertainty which could impact future operating results 

the company also continues to focus on controlling its costs the company experienced continued high raw material and energy costs throughout 2014 historically the company has been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent by passing along some of these cost increases to customers the company has also entered into set pricing and prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel the company expects by the second half of 2015 to benefit from macro trends including an improving us economy lower commodity prices and productivity programs 

additionally maintaining tight controls on overhead costs has been a hallmark of the company and has enabled it to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions 

the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of the company’s overall strategy acquisitions have added significantly to company sales and profits over the last decade however the failure to effectively integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause the company to incur material asset writedowns the company actively seeks acquisitions that fit its guidelines and its strong financial position provides it with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in addition the company’s ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled it to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions since 2001 the company has acquired eight of its nine “power brands” 

the company believes it is positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives maintaining competitive marketing and trade spending managing its cost structure continuing to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursuing strategic acquisitions this focus together with the strength of the company’s portfolio of premium and value brands has enabled the company to succeed in a range of economic environments  and is expected to position the company to continue to increase stockholder value over the longterm moreover the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations as a result of net income and effective working capital management combined with an investment grade credit rating provides the company with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions drive new product development make capital expenditures to support organic growth and gross margin improvements return cash to stockholders through dividends and share buy backs and reduce outstanding debt positioning it to continue to create stockholder value

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty they are based on the company’s historical experience its observation of trends in industry information provided by its customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate the company’s significant accounting policies and estimates are described below 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves

virtually all of the company’s revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by the company’s customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on the company’s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company’s products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements an approximately 54 difference in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns the company uses experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if the company’s estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 62 while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 the company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately 67 37 and 40 respectively based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information these adjustments are immaterial relative to the amount of trade promotion expense incurred annually by the company

carrying values of goodwill trade names and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment  for finite intangible assets the company assesses business triggering events the company’s impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trade names and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired the result of the company’s annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units in addition there were no goodwill impairment charges for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2014

the company recognized intangible asset impairment charges within sga for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2014 as follows



 

the impairment charges recorded in 2014 and 2013 were a result of actual and projected reductions in sales and profitability as a result of increased competition the amount of the impairment charges was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the assets to their carrying amount fair value was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” or “excess earnings” discounted cash flow method which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change and therefore could impact fair values in the future the company determined that the fair value of all other intangible assets as of december 31 2014 exceeded their respective carrying values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability in 2014 the results of the company’s annual impairment test for indefinite lived trade names resulted in a personal care trade name whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by 11 this trade name is valued at approximately 37 and is considered an important asset to the company the company continues to monitor performance and should there be any significant change in forecasted assumptions or estimates including sales profitability and discount rate the company may be required to recognize an impairment charge 

it is possible that the company’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if for example i the businesses or brands do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in 2015 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment  the company’s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the longlived assets are largely independent of other groups of company assets and liabilities the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology the continued success of product lines and future volume revenue and expense growth rates the company conducts annual reviews to identify idle and underutilized equipment and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when an impairment is indicated the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and fair value

the company recognized charges related to plant impairment and equipment obsolescence which occurs in the ordinary course of business for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2014 as follows 



the impairment charges in 2014 and 2013 and the consumer domestic and spd impairment charges in 2012 are due to idling of equipment the 2012 consumer international charge is due to the cancelation of a software project the estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations nevertheless future outcomes may differ materially from management’s estimates if the company’s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized then the company’s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges

inventory valuation

when appropriate the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value which reflects any costs to sell or dispose the company identifies any slow moving obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is required to establish a new carrying value the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company’s products technological changes and new product introductions in addition the company’s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units skus the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were 83 at december 31 2014 and 101 at december 31 2013 

valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs

the company’s pension costs relate solely to its international operations both pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in benefit cost valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s international pension and domesticinternational postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets 

the discount rate is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the company’s pension plans and postretirement plans the company refers to an applicable index and expected term of benefit payments to select a discount rate at which it believes the plan benefits could be effectively settled the company’s weighted average discount rate for its international pension plans as of december 31 2014 is 354 as compared to 448 used at december 31 2013 based on the published rate as of december 31 2014 that matched estimated cash flows for the plans the company used a weighted average discount rate of 377 for its postretirement plans as compared to 456 used at december 31 2013 

the expected longterm rate of return on international pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the historical trend the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans the asset mix of the plans and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation based on these factors the company’s weighted average expected longterm rate of return for assets of its pension plans for 2014 was 616 compared to 545 used in 2013 a 50 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return would result in an approximate 05 change in pension expense for 2015

as noted above changes in assumptions used by management may result in material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs in 2014 other comprehensive income reflected a 13 increase in its remaining pension plan obligations and a 44 increase for postretirement benefit plans the changes are related to the change in discount rates for all plans and other actuarial assumptions

the company made cash contributions of approximately 33 to its pension plans in 2014 the company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately 24 in 2015 to offset 2015 benefit payments and administrative costs in excess of investment returns 

on december 31 2014 the company terminated an international defined benefit pension plan under which approximately 280 participants including approximately 100 active employees have accrued benefits the company anticipates completing the termination of this plan by the end of the second quarter of 2015 once regulatory approvals are obtained to effect the termination the company estimates based on december 31 2014 valuations that the plan has sufficient assets to purchase annuities for retired participants and make certain deposits to the existing defined contribution plan of active employee participants the company estimates that it will incur a onetime noncash expense of approximately 8 to 11 6 to 8 after tax in 2015 when the plan settlement is completed this expense is primarily attributable to pension settlement accounting rules which require accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were to be amortized over the expected benefit lives of participants the estimated expense is subject to change based on valuations at the actual date of settlement

income taxes

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized the company records liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under us gaap guidelines the liabilities relate to tax return positions that although supportable by the company may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement the company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change in this regard settlement of any issue or an adverse determination in litigation with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in the company’s annual tax rate conversely favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to the company’s annual tax rate

new accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance that clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue the new guidance provides that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to receive for those goods or services the new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 and allows companies to apply the requirements retrospectively either to all prior periods presented or through a cumulative adjustment in the year of adoption early adoption is not allowed the company is currently evaluating the impact if any that the adoption of the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

there have been no other accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted by the company which are expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

the cost of raw materials including surfactants diesel fuel and oilbased raw and packaging materials used primarily in the consumer businesses continued to be high in 2013 relative to prior years however while the market price of ethylenebased resin was at an alltime high in 2013 the company’s cost for this material was mitigated as a result of the company’s ability to contractually lock in pricing for the first nine months of 2013 increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact the company’s costs and financial results if the company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers

dietary supplements 

the processing formulation safety manufacturing packaging labeling advertising distribution importing selling and storing of dietary supplements are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies including the fda the ftc the cpsc the epa and by various agencies of the states and localities in which the company’s products are sold the fdca governs the composition safety labeling manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements 

generally dietary ingredients that were marketed in the us prior to october 15 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the fda “new” dietary ingredients  ie dietary ingredients that were not marketed in the us before october 15 1994 must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the fda at least 75 days before the initial marketing unless the ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for food without being chemically altered a new dietary ingredient notification must provide evidence of a history of use or other evidence establishing that use of the dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe the fda may determine that a new dietary ingredient notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe such a determination could effectively prevent the marketing of the dietary ingredient on july 5 2011 the fda issued draft guidance governing notification of new dietary ingredients the draft guidance was issued for public comment and not for implementation the guidance if implemented could effectively change the status of dietary ingredients that the industry has marketed as “old” dietary ingredients to “new” dietary ingredients that may require submission of a new dietary ingredient notification 

the fdca permits “statements of nutritional support” to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without fda premarket approval the fda must be notified of those statements within 30 days of marketing among other things the statements may describe the role of a dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function of the body or characterize the documented mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient maintains such structure or function but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose cure mitigate treat or prevent a disease a company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess information substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading if the fda determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim or if the fda determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific evidence or is otherwise false or misleading the claim could not be used and any product bearing the claim could be subject to regulatory action 

the fda’s cgmp regulations govern the manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers as with otc products the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that the company’s dietary supplement facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representation made to customers or to regulatory action against the company related to the products made in that facility seizure injunction or recall there remains considerable uncertainty with respect to the fda’s interpretation of the cgmp regulations and their actual implementation in manufacturing facilities the failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cgmp regulations may render products manufactured in that facility adulterated and subjects those products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential fda enforcement actions in addition under recent amendments to the fdca the manufacturing of dietary ingredients contained in dietary supplements will be subject to similar or even more burdensome requirements which may increase the costs of dietary ingredients and subject suppliers of such ingredients to more rigorous inspections and enforcement the manufacturer packer or distributor of a dietary supplement marketed in the us whose name appears on the label of the supplement is required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of that supplement to fda 

the ftc exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements the ftc considers whether a product’s advertising claims are accurate truthful and not misleading pursuant to its authority under the federal trade commission act or ftc act the ftc has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of 

  

otherwise false or misleading advertising claims these enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties andor restitution by the companies involved such actions can result in substantial financial penalties and significantly restrict the marketing of a dietary supplement 

legislation may be introduced which if passed would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements the effect of additional domestic or international governmental legislation regulations or administrative orders if and when promulgated cannot be determined new legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards and require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risks and uncertainties as well as others described elsewhere in this annual report could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

 

 unfavorable and uncertain economic conditions have adversely affected and in the future may adversely affect demand for some of the categories of products the company sells resulting in reduced sales volume or market share or a shift in its product mix from higher margin to lower margin products factors that can affect demand include competitors’ products advertising and pricing actions rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior including delays in the timing of tax refunds from the federal government gasoline and home heating oil pricing reduced unemployment benefits in periods of high unemployment and tax increases while the vast majority of the company’s products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products they may become subject to increasing price competition as recessionary conditions continue moreover some of the company’s products such as laundry additives and batteryoperated toothbrushes are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of the company’s customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs home stores and dollar pet and other specialty stores have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to the company on a timely basis or at all the company regularly reviews the financial strength of its key customers and where appropriate modifies customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales because the same economic conditions impact many of the company’s suppliers the company also regularly conducts a similar review of its suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to company operations where appropriate the company intends to identify alternate sources of materials and services to date the company has not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting its customers or suppliers however a protracted economic downturn that adversely affects the company’s suppliers and customers could adversely affect its sales and results of operations 

 

 the company faces intense competition from consumer products companies both in the us and in international markets most of the company’s products compete with other widelyadvertised brands within each product category and with private label brands and generic nonbranded products of its customers in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices 

the company’s products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers consumer products are subject to significant price competition as a result the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products or increase prices by an amount that does not cover manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices or inability to raise prices sufficiently to cover manufacturing cost increases would harm profit margins in addition if the company’s sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins its results of operations would suffer 

advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on retail customer decisions regarding the brands and product lines they sell and on consumer purchasing decisions a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains 

  

consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if the company’s advertising marketing and promotional programs are not effective or adequate its sales and volume may be impacted 

many of the company’s competitors are large companies including pg the sun products corporation the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel ag  co kgaa reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson ansell limited alere inc pfizer inc bayer ag sc johnson  son inc pharmavite llc and nbty inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than does the company and therefore have the capacity to outspend the company on advertising and promotional activities and introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than can the company in addition the company’s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by it competitive activity may require the company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced profits and adversely affect growth if the company loses market share and the markets in which it competes do not grow substantially its sales levels and operating results will decline 

since the 2012 introduction in the us of unit dose laundry detergent by various manufacturers including the company there has been significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category contributing to an overall category decline during 2012 the category declined 06 and during 2013 the category declined an additional 32 while the company’s laundry detergent sales have increased more than offsetting the impact of the total laundry detergent category decline there is no assurance that the category will not decline further or that the company will be able to offset any such category decline moreover pg the market leader in premium laundry detergent including unit dose laundry detergent has recently reconfigured certain of its product offerings and related marketing and pricing strategies and launched various products to compete more directly with the company’s core arm  hammer and oxiclean power brands in 2014 pg is launching a lowerpriced laundry detergent to compete directly with the company’s core value laundry detergents is attempting to leverage its leadership position in unit dose laundry detergent with the introduction of a premium unit dose offering and has launched a versatile stain remover all of which are expected to be supported by aggressive trade spending and marketing these actions together with expected ongoing weak consumer spending and increased price competition could negatively impact the company’s laundry detergent and versatile stain remover businesses 

 

 a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the company’s net sales walmart is the company’s largest customer accounting for approximately 24 of net sales in 2013 24 of net sales in 2012 and 23 of net sales in 2011 the company’s top three customers accounted for approximately 35 of net sales in 2013 34 of net sales in 2012 and 33 of net sales in 2011 the company expects that a significant portion of its net sales will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues as a result changes in the strategies of walmart or any of the company’s other largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products could materially harm the company’s net sales and profitability 

in addition the company’s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and it rarely enters into longterm contracts with its customers accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the company at any time and for any reason if the company loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

 in recent years the company has seen increasing retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailer customers who may demand lower pricing special packaging or impose other requirements on the company these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship some of the company’s customers particularly its highvolume retail store customers have sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to the extent the company provides concessions or better trade terms to those customers its margins are reduced further if the company is unable to effectively respond to the demands of its customers these customers could reduce their purchases of company products and increase their purchases of products from competitors which would harm the company’s sales and profitability in addition reductions in inventory by the company’s customers including as a result of consolidations in the retail industry or these customers managing their working capital requirements could result in reduced orders for company products and adversely affect its results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions 

protracted unfavorable market conditions have caused many of the company’s customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell and reduce or discontinue certain of the company’s product lines particularly those products that were not number one or two in their category if this continues to occur and the company is unable to improve distribution for those products at other customers its results could be adversely affected 

in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains are typically sold at lower prices than branded products as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending the company’s customers have discontinued or reduced distribution of some of its products to encourage those consumers to purchase the customers’ less expensive private label products primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories to the extent customers discontinue or reduce distribution of the company’s products or these products are adversely affected by customers’ actions to increase shelf space for their private label products the company will focus its efforts on improving distribution with other customers however if the company’s efforts are not effective its results could be adversely affected 

 

 the company’s performance depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and the financial difficulties of the company’s retailer customers consumer products such as those marketed by the company are increasingly being sold by club stores dollar stores and mass merchandisers sales of the company’s products remain strongest in the mass merchandiser food and drug channels of trade and are increasing in the club stores and dollar stores channels although the company has taken steps to improve and has seen improvement in sales to club stores and dollar stores if the current trend continues and the company is not successful in further improving sales to these channels its financial condition and operating results could suffer 

 

 a significant percentage of the company’s revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during 2013 approximately 80 of the company’s sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to the company’s most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes dietary supplements antiperspirants and deodorants the company’s ability to achieve unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased 

  

use of its products by consumers its ability to drive growth through product innovation in existing and new product categories investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from its competitors if the company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that expand its product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products it may not achieve its sales growth objectives even if the company is successful in increasing sales within its product categories a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for the company’s products could have a negative impact on its financial results 

 

 the company initiates expansion projects from time to time for example the company is currently expanding its gummy vitamin production capacity at its york pennsylvania manufacturing facility to meet expected future product demand the new gummy vitamin line is expected to start production in the first quarter of 2015 projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors including the following shortages of equipment materials or skilled labor work stoppages unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment unanticipated cost increases difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions difficulties in meeting regulatory requirements or obtaining regulatory approvals availability of suppliers to certify equipment for existing and enhanced regulations design and engineering problems and failure or delay of third party service providers civil unrest and labor disputes significant cost overruns or delays in completing a project could have a material adverse effect on the company’s return on investment results of operations and cash flows in addition if the company miscalculates its anticipated capacity needs this too could negatively impact its operations financial condition and results of operations 

 

 the company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain of its commodities and raw materials including sole source suppliers for certain of its raw materials packaging product components finished products and other necessary supplies new suppliers may have to be qualified under governmental industry and company standards which can require additional investment and time the company may be unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships it may be unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity quality and price levels needed for its business or certain of the company’s key suppliers may become insolvent or experience other financial distress if any of these events occurs and the company has failed to identify and qualify an alternative vendor then it may be unable to meet its contractual obligations and customer expectations which could damage its reputation and result in lost customers and sales or the company may incur higher than expected expenses either of which could materially and adversely affect its business operations and results of operations 

 

 the principal raw materials and packaging used by the company include surfactants cleaning agents paper products and resinbased molded components volatility and increases in the price of raw materials or increases in the costs of energy shipping and other necessary services could significantly affect the company’s profit margins if it is unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution historically the company has attempted to address such price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of its products entering into prebuying 

  

or lockedin pricing arrangements with certain suppliers and entering into hedge agreements there is no assurance however that the company will be able to fully offset any price increases especially given the competitive environment in addition volatility in certain commodity markets could significantly affect the company’s production cost and therefore harm its financial condition and operating results 

the company uses hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices and related fuel surcharges the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to product costs enabling the company to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in prices over the term of the contract however in periods of declining fuel prices the hedge agreements can have the effect of locking the company in at abovemarket prices 

 

 the company’s future performance and growth depends on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product line extensions the company cannot be certain that it will achieve its innovation goals the successful development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development marketing and promotional expenditures which the company may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the company has limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays competitor actions regulatory approval hurdles and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of existing products the company’s financial performance could be harmed 

for example the company has been launching more new products into “white space” categories than it has historically in 2014 the company is expanding the oxiclean brand into three additional categories premium laundry detergent dishwashing detergent and bleach alternatives in addition the company is launching new products across almost all of its core businesses including a premium cat litter called arm  hammer clump  seal a new premium toothpaste called arm  hammer truly radiant a new vitamin line for the vitafusion brand and new condoms vibrators and lubricants under the trojan brand while these new products have received strong distribution acceptance from the company’s retailers to date and will be supported by increased marketing spending there is no assurance that the company’s customers and consumers will purchase these new products if these new products are not successful in gaining market share the company’s financial results could suffer 

from time to time the company has discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs the company may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent it discontinues products that do not meet expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand 

 

 the company’s financial success is directly dependent on the reputation and success of its brands particularly the arm  hammer oxiclean trojan l’il critters and vitafusion brands the effectiveness of these brands could suffer if the company’s marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further the company’s results could be adversely affected if one or more of its leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality or safety issues 

additionally claims made in the company’s marketing campaigns may become subject to litigation alleging false advertising which if successful could cause the company to alter its marketing plans and may 

  

materially and adversely affect sales or result in the imposition of significant damages against the company or other customer or consumer dissatisfaction especially if such dissatisfaction were to be broadly disseminated including through the use of social media 

 

 from time to time the company is subject to product liability claims the company may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by its products including losses or injuries caused by raw materials or other components provided by third party suppliers that are included in the company’s products claims could be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants are improperly labeled or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances whether or not successful product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s sales and operating results and the reputation of its brands in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective or noncompliant with applicable rules or regulations it could be required to withdraw or recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability and product recall insurance coverage that also covers product withdrawals potential product liability claims and withdrawal and recall costs may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

 

 the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties the company has incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations the company currently is subject to environmental regulatory proceedings involving its brazilian subsidiary which has been fined the equivalent of approximately 21 million at current exchange rates in the proceedings the brazilian subsidiary is contesting the fine in addition the company may be required to remove certain landfills in brazil in connection with these proceedings the cost of which is estimated to be in the range of 30 million to 50 million it is possible that the company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future particularly with respect to its operations in brazil that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 

 

 the manufacturing processing formulation including stability packaging labeling marketing distribution and sale of the company’s products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the fcda the ftc the united states department of agriculture the epa and the cpsc in addition the company’s and its suppliers’ operations are subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board the company’s activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which its products are sold 

in particular the fda regulates the formulation safety manufacturing packaging labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits battery operated toothbrushes overthecounter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements including vitamins and minerals the fda also exercises oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the 

  

fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of the company’s other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that the company and its suppliers use to manufacture regulated products and may identify compliance issues that would require the company and its suppliers to make certain changes in its manufacturing facilities and processes the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to regulatory action against the products made in that facility including seizure injunction or recall as well as to possible action against the owner of the facilitymanufacturer the company may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until the compliance issue has been remediated as a result the company’s business could be adversely affected 

likewise any future determination by the fda or a similar foreign agency or by the company in reviewing its compliance with applicable rules and regulations that the company’s products or quality systems do not comply with applicable regulations could result in future compliance activities including product withdrawals or recalls import detentions injunctions preventing the shipment of products or other enforcement actions for example the fda may determine that a particular claim that the company uses to support the marketing of a product is not substantiated may not accept the evidence of safety for a new product that the company may wish to market may challenge the safety or effectiveness of existing products based on among other things changes in formulations inadequate stability or “shelflife” consumer complaints or improper labeling and may determine that the company’s dietary supplement business manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations do not comply with cgmps similarly the company may identify these or other issues in internal compliance reviews of its operations and the operations and products of vendors and acquired companies these other issues may include the identification of contaminants or noncompliant levels of particular ingredients any of the foregoing could subject the company to adverse publicity force it to incur unanticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the commission has promulgated final rules mandated by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold known as “conflict minerals” in products manufactured by public companies certain of the company’s products including its diagnostic test kits and spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrushes use these minerals sourced through third parties the new rules require the company to conduct due diligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo the drc or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the drc the company’s first conflict minerals report required by the new rules is due by may 31 2014 and annually thereafter the company has incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs to determine the origin of minerals used in its products in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of such minerals used in the company’s products also the company may face disqualification as a supplier for customers and reputational challenges or may need to discontinue supply from its suppliers if its due diligence procedures do not enable it to verify the origins for the minerals used in its products or determine that the minerals are conflict free 

from time to time congress the fda the ftc the commission or other federal state local or foreign legislative and regulatory authorities may impose additional laws or regulations that apply to the company repeal laws or regulations that the company considers favorable or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations the company is not able to predict the nature of such future laws regulations repeals or interpretations or to predict the effect additional governmental regulation when and if it occurs would have on its business in the future such developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated additional recordkeeping requirements increased documentation of the properties of certain products additional or different labeling additional scientific substantiation expanded adverse event reporting or other new requirements any such developments could increase the company’s costs significantly and could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations 

  

 the company’s distribution of condoms under the trojan brand and other trademarks is regulated by the fda certain of the company’s condoms and similar condoms sold by its competitors contain the spermicide nonoxynol9 “n9” some interested groups have issued reports that n9 should not be used rectally or for multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse in late 2008 the fda issued final labeling guidance for latex condoms but excluded n9 lubricated condoms from the guidance while the company awaits further fda guidance on n9 lubricated condoms it believes that its present labeling for condoms with n9 is compliant with the overall objectives of the fda’s guidance and that condoms with n9 will remain a viable contraceptive choice for those couples who wish to use them however the company cannot predict the nature of the labeling that ultimately will be required by the fda if the fda or a state government eventually promulgates rules that prohibit or restrict the use of n9 in condoms such as new labeling requirements the company could incur costs from obsolete products packaging or raw materials and sales of condoms could decline which in turn could decrease the company’s earnings 

 

 the company’s international operations subject it to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these risks could have a significant impact on the company’s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position in all foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates it is subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions 

in addition the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar outside of the us sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the euro british pound brazilian real canadian dollar mexican peso chinese yuan and australian dollar a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated 

  

relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow the company from time to time enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed intercompany sales or purchases denominated in the us dollar canadian dollar british pound and euro 

 

 the company seeks to acquire or invest in businesses that offer products services or technologies that are complementary the company has made eight acquisitions in the past ten years including the following brands spinbrush batterypowered toothbrushes oxiclean kaboom and orange glo cleaning products orajel oral analgesics simply saline nasal moisturizers tooth tunes musical toothbrushes feline pine natural cat litter batiste dry shampoo and l’il critters and vitafusion dietary supplements 

the company may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future however the company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive valuations obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions in addition all acquisitions and investments entail various risks including the difficulty of entering new markets or product categories the challenges of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of the company’s ongoing business and the ongoing business of the acquired company the need to review and if necessary upgrade processes of the acquired company to conform to the company’s own processes and applicable legal and regulatory requirements and generally the company’s potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment any of these risks may divert management and other resources require the company to incur unanticipated costs or delay the anticipated positive impact on the company’s business and results of the acquisition the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent the company acquires businesses that have standalone operations that cannot easily be integrated or operations or sources of supply outside of the us and canada for which products are manufactured locally by third parties these factors could harm the company’s financial condition and operating results 

acquired companies or operations or newlycreated ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made in addition future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the potentially dilutive issuances of new equity by the company or the incurrence of additional debt or contingent liabilities all of which could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and resources from other matters that are critical to the company’s operations 

 

 the company relies extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to conduct its business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating to internal communications and communications with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers billing customers and receiving and applying payment processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements collecting and storing customer consumer employee investor and other stakeholder information and personal data and other processes necessary to manage the company’s business 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of the company’s information technology 

  

systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of the company’s data the company’s information technology systems networks or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or the company could suffer a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages and security breaches although the company has business continuity plans in place to address service interruptions if these business continuity plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct its operations which may adversely affect its business 

any business interruptions or data security breaches including cyber security breaches resulting in private data disclosure could result in lawsuits or regulatory proceedings damage the company’s reputation or adversely impact the company’s results of operations and cash flows further negative postings or comments about the company on any social networking website could damage its reputation as could the disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information through social media 

 

 as of december 31 2013 the company had approximately 8034 million of total consolidated indebtedness this amount of indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that the company now faces could intensify any decision regarding future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time including the company’s credit rating 

 

 the company’s ability to repay and refinance its indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends primarily on its cash flow cash flow is often subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond the company’s control and such factors may limit its ability to repay indebtedness and fund capital expenditures a failure to service its indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

 

 although the board has recently authorized new share repurchase programs and recently increased the amount of the quarterly cash dividends payable on the common stock any board determinations to continue to 

  

repurchase the common stock or to continue to pay cash dividends on the common stock in each case at levels consistent with recent practice or at all will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations business requirements price of the common stock in the case of the repurchase programs and the board’s continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of company stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event the company does not declare a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases its stock price could be adversely affected 

 

 in recent years the banking system and financial markets have experienced severe disruption including among other things bank failures and consolidations severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades declines in asset valuations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these conditions present the following risks to the company among others 

 

  

 although the company believes that its operating cash flows together with its access to the credit markets provides it with significant discretionary funding capacity the inability of one or more institutions to fulfill funding obligations under the credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity and operations 

 

 the company’s future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized if the actual amount of the company’s future taxable income is less than the amount it is currently projecting with respect to specific tax jurisdictions or if there is a change in the time period within which the deferred tax asset becomes deductible the company could be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets the recording of a valuation allowance would result in an increase in the company’s effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on its operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change the company’s deferred tax assets or liability balances which would have either a favorable or unfavorable impact on its effective tax rate 

  

 significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions the company provides for uncertain tax positions with respect to tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards mandated by applicable accounting guidance fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact the company’s effective tax rate and its financial results the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities and although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company’s effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

 

 the market for the company’s products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with its trademarks and brand names including arm  hammer trojan oxiclean l’il critters and vitafusion the company owns the material trademarks and brand names used in connection with the marketing and distribution of its major products both in the us and in other countries in addition the company holds several valuable patents on its products which the company believes serve as an effective barrier to entry for new competitors accordingly the company relies on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property rights although most of the company’s material intellectual property is registered in the us and in certain foreign countries in which it operates it cannot be sure that its intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or if necessary successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future and the company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties infringe the company’s intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of the company’s brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the company’s brands and harm its sales the company’s failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make it less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition also the company’s patents are granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed while the company considers no single patent to be material to the business as a whole it does recognize that the loss of key patents will allow for increased competition specifically to its spinbrush batterypowered toothbrush first response pregnancy test kit and answer pregnancy test kit brands 

in addition if the company’s products are found to infringe intellectual property rights of others the owners of those rights could bring legal actions against the company claiming substantial damages for past infringement and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products if these legal actions are successful in addition to any potential liability for damages from past infringement the company could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products potentially adding significant costs the company might not prevail in any action brought against it or it may be unsuccessful in securing any license for continued use and therefore have to discontinue the marketing and sale of a product this could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business operating results and financial condition 

  

 the company has a material amount of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets as well as other longlived assets which are periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards declines in the company’s profitability andor estimated cash flows related to specific intangible assets as well as potential changes in market valuations for similar assets and market discount rates may result in an impairment charge which could reduce the company’s net income and otherwise have an adverse impact on operating results 

 

 the company’s operations as well as the operations of its third party manufacturers suppliers and customers may be subject to disruption from a variety of causes including work stoppages material shortages financial difficulties acts of war terrorism pandemics fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

 

 the company’s future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business prospects financial condition and results of operations this effect could be exacerbated if any officers or other key personnel left as a group or at the same time the company’s success also depends in part on its continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future

the company in the ordinary course of its business is the subject of or party to various pending or threatened legal actions litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of certain individual litigated matters may not be reasonably predictable and any related damages may not be estimable some litigation matters including those described below could result in an adverse outcome for the company and any such adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

brazil environmental matters 

in 2000 the company acquired majority ownership in its brazilian subsidiary quimica geral do nordeste sa “qgn” the acquired operations included an inorganic salt manufacturing plant which began site operations in the late 1970’s located on the site were two closed landfills two active landfills and a pond for the management of the process waste streams in 2009 qgn was advised by the environmental authority in the state of bahia the institute of the environment “ima” that the plant was discharging contaminants into an adjacent creek after learning of the discharge qgn took immediate action to cease the discharge and retained two nationally recognized environmental firms to prepare a site investigation  remedial action plan “sira” the sira report was submitted by qgn to ima in april 2010 the report concluded that the likely sources of the discharge were the failure of the pond and closed landfills qgn ceased site operations in august 2010 in november 2010 ima responded to qgn’s recommendation for an additional study by issuing a notification requiring a broad range of remediation measures the “remediation notification” which included the shutdown and removal of two onsite landfills in addition despite repeated discussions with ima at qgn’s request to consider qgn’s proposed remediation alternatives in december 2010 ima imposed a fine of five million brazilian real approximately us 21 million at current exchange rates for the discharge of contaminants above allowable limits the description of the fine included a reference to aggravating factors that may indicate that local “management’s intent” was considered in determining the severity of the fine which could result in criminal liability for members of local management in january 2011 qgn filed with ima an administrative defense to the fine suspending any enforcement activities pending its defense ima has not yet formally responded to qgn’s administrative defense 

with respect to the remediation notification qgn engaged in discussions with ima during which qgn asserted that a number of the remediation measures including the removal of the landfills and the timeframes for implementation were not appropriate and requested that the remediation notification be withdrawn in response in february 2011 ima issued a revised remediation notification the “revised remediation notification” providing for further site analysis by qgn including further study of the integrity of the landfills the revised remediation notification did not include a requirement to remove the landfills however it did not foreclose the possibility of such requirement qgn has responded to the revised remediation notification providing further information regarding the remediation measures and is in discussions with the institute of environment and waste management “inema” successor to ima to seek agreement on an appropriate remediation plan in mid2011 qgn consistent with the revised remediation notice began an additional site investigation and capped the two active landfills in 2012 qgn drained the waste pond during the third quarter of 2013 inema approved in writing the first step in qgn’s proposed remediation plans the installation of a trench drain to capture and treat groundwater at the site qgn expects to begin construction of the trench drain in early 2014 and to continue discussions with inema concerning the resolution of the fine 

as a result of the foregoing events the company accrued approximately 3 million in 2009 and 48 million in 2010 for remediation fines and related costs since 2009 the costs of remediation activities and foreign exchange rate changes have reduced the accrual by approximately 38 million to a current amount of 40 million as a result of inema’s approval of the first step in qgn’s remediation plans the company does not believe that it will be required to remove the landfills however it remains reasonably possible that inema will require such removal and the company could be unsuccessful in appealing such decision the company estimates the cost of such landfill removal would be in the range of 30 million to 50 million

 strategic goals challenges and initiatives 

the company’s ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for its products and retail customers’ decisions to carry its products which are in part affected by general economic conditions in its markets in 2013 many of the markets in which the company operates continued to experience general economic softness and weak or inconsistent consumer demand although the company’s consumer products generally are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products the continued economic downturn has reduced demand in many categories particularly those in personal care and affected company sales in recent periods some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category in addition an increasing portion of the company’s product categories are being sold by club stores dollar stores and mass merchandisers these customer actions have placed downward pressure on the company’s sales and gross margins 

the company expects the challenging conditions of the last several years to continue in 2014 primarily due to continued weak consumer demand in many categories new product introductions by competitors and continuing aggressive competitive pricing pressures in the us a continued slowdown in income growth the unemployment rate and the uncertainty of unemployment benefits for the longterm unemployed may also adversely impact consumption patterns to continue to deliver attractive results for stockholders in this environment the company intends to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives maintain competitive marketing and trade spending tightly control its cost structure continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursue strategic acquisitions the company also intends to continue to grow its product sales geographically in an attempt to mitigate the impact of weakness in any one area and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products to appeal to a wide range of consumers 

the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain product categories from other larger multinational competitors some of which have greater resources such activities have included new product introductions more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending since the 2012 introduction in the us of unit dose laundry detergent by various manufacturers including the company there has been significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category contributing to an overall category decline during 2012 the category declined by 06 and during 2013 the category declined an additional 32 while the company’s laundry detergent sales have increased more than offsetting the impact of the total laundry detergent category decline there is no assurance that the category will not decline further or that the company will be able to offset any such category decline 

moreover pg one of the company’s major competitors and the market leader in premium laundry detergent including unit dose laundry detergent has recently reconfigured certain of its product offerings and related marketing and pricing strategies and launched various products to compete more directly with the company’s core arm  hammer xtra and oxiclean power brands for example in 2014 pg is launching a lowerpriced laundry detergent to compete directly with the company’s core value laundry detergents is attempting to leverage its leadership position in unit dose laundry detergent with the introduction of

dollars in millions except share and per share data 

  

a premium unit dose offering and has launched a versatile stain remover all of which are expected to be supported by aggressive trade spending and marketing these actions together with expected ongoing weak consumer spending and increased price competition could negatively impact the company’s laundry detergent and versatile stain remover businesses 

the company is responding to these competitive pressures by among other things focusing on strengthening its key brands including increased focus on the arm  hammer oxiclean trojan and l’il critters and vitafusion mega brands which each span various product categories and represented approximately 60 of the company’s sales and profits in 2013 through the launch of innovative new products and strong sales execution supported by increased marketing and trade spending these mega brands have advantages over other power brands including the ability to leverage research and development and marketing investments and lower overhead costs across mega brand categories for example the company’s 2014 responsive product introductions include the simultaneous launch of oxiclean branded products into the midpremium tier laundry detergent segment auto dish detergent category and bleach alternatives with continued support of and innovation in the company’s base arm  hammer and oxiclean businesses to create scale and maximize marketing efforts mega brand launches and launches of other products are anticipated to contribute more incremental new product revenue than the introduction of new products has in prior years and a significant portion of those revenues will include expansion into new categories with premium household products supported by increased levels of slotting trade promotions and incremental marketing support and planned ongoing technology investment there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 

despite challenging economic conditions and customer responses to these conditions the company was able to grow market share in six of nine of its “power brands” in 2013 including laundry detergent the company’s global product portfolio consists of both premium 55 of total revenue in 2013 and value 45 of total revenue in 2013 brands which it believes enables it to succeed in a range of economic environments the company’s value brands have performed strongly during economic downturns and the company intends to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among costconscious consumers 

over the past 13 years the company has diversified from an almost exclusively us business to a global company with approximately 17 of sales derived from foreign countries in 2013 the company has operations in six countries canada mexico uk france australia and brazil and exports to over 90 other countries in 2013 the company benefited from its concentration in north america in light of the economic downturn in europe however the company has continued and will continue to focus on selectively expanding its global business 

the company also continues to focus on controlling its costs the company experienced continued high raw material and energy costs throughout 2013 historically the company has been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent by passing along some of these cost increases to customers the company has also entered into set pricing and prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel and related surcharges however the increased price competition for these commodities in recent periods has diminished the impact of some of these measures and affected the company’s gross margins 

additionally maintaining tight controls on overhead costs has been a hallmark of the company and has enabled it to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions 

the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of the company’s overall strategy acquisitions have added significantly to company sales and profits over the last decade however the failure to effectively integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause the company to incur material asset writedowns the company actively seeks acquisitions that fit its guidelines

and its strong financial position provides it with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in addition the company’s ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled it to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions since 2001 the company has acquired eight of its nine “power brands” in 2013 the company completed the integration of the acquisition of its l’il critters and vitafusion dietary supplements business which it acquired in 2012 

the company believes it is positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives maintaining competitive marketing and trade spending managing its cost structure continuing to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursuing strategic acquisitions this focus together with the strength of the company’s portfolio of premium and value brands has enabled the company to succeed in a range of economic environments and should position the company to continue to increase stockholder value over the longterm moreover the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations as a result of net income and effective working capital management combined with an investment grade credit rating provides the company with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions drive new product development make capital expenditures to support organic growth and gross margin improvements return cash to stockholders through dividends and share buy backs and reduce outstanding debt positioning it to continue to create stockholder value

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty they are based on the company’s historical experience its observation of trends in industry information provided by its customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate the company’s significant accounting policies and estimates are described below 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves 

virtually all of the company’s revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by the company’s customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on the company’s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company’s products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements an approximately 31 difference in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns the company uses experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if the company’s estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 71 while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 the company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately 37 40 and 82 respectively based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information these adjustments are immaterial relative to the amount of trade promotion expense incurred annually by the company 

impairment of goodwill trade names and other intangible assets and property plant and equipment 

carrying values of goodwill trade names and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment  for finite intangible assets the company assesses business triggering events the company’s impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trademarks and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have

dollars in millions except share and per share data 

  

become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired the result of the company’s annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units in addition there were no goodwill impairment charges for the three year period ended december 31 2013 

the company recognized trade name impairment charges within sga for the three year period ended december 31 2013 as follows 

 

 the trade name impairment charges recorded in 2013 were a result of actual and projected reductions in sales and profitability as a result of increased competition the amount of the impairment charges was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the assets to their carrying amount fair value was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” or “excess earnings” discounted cash flow method which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change and therefore could impact fair values in the future the company determined that the remaining carrying value of all other trade names exceeded their respective fair values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability of the brands 

it is possible that the company’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if for example i the businesses or brands do not perform as projected ii overall economic conditions in 2014 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment  the company’s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the longlived assets are largely independent of other groups of company assets and liabilities the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology the continued success of product lines and future volume revenue and expense growth rates the company conducts annual reviews to identify idle and underutilized equipment and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when an impairment is indicated the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and fair value

the company recognized charges related to plant impairment and equipment obsolescence which occurs in the ordinary course of business during the three year period ended december 31 2013 as follows 

 

 the 2013 and 2012 consumer domestic and spd charges are due to the idling of equipment and the 2012 consumer international charge is due to the cancelation of a software project the 2011 consumer domestic charge is a result of the idling of equipment the 2011 spd charge is associated with the company’s decision to explore strategic options for the specialty chemical business in brazil the estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations nevertheless future outcomes may differ materially from management’s estimates if the company’s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized then the company’s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 

inventory valuation 

when appropriate the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value which reflects any costs to sell or dispose the company identifies any slow moving obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is required to establish a new carrying value the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company’s products technological changes and new product introductions in addition the company’s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units skus the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were 101 at december 31 2013 and 57 at december 31 2012 

valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs 

the company’s pension costs relate solely to its international operations both pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in benefit cost valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s international pension and domesticinternational postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets 

the discount rate is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the company’s pension plans and postretirement plans the company refers to an applicable index and expected term of benefit payments to select a discount rate at which it believes the plan benefits could be effectively settled the company’s weighted average discount rate for its international pension plans as of december 31 2013 is 448 as compared to 416 used at december 31 2012 based on the published rate as of december 31 2013 that matched estimated cash flows for the plans the company used a weighted average discount rate of 456 for its postretirement plans as compared to 389 used at december 31 2012 

  

church  dwight co inc and subsidiaries 

dollars in millions except share and per share data 

  

the expected longterm rate of return on international pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the historical trend the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans the asset mix of the plans and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation based on these factors the company’s weighted average expected longterm rate of return for assets of its pension plans for 2013 was 545 compared to 535 used in 2012 a 50 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return would result in an approximate 05 change in pension expense for 2014 

as noted above changes in assumptions used by management may result in material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs in 2013 other comprehensive income reflected a 50 decrease in its remaining pension plan obligations and a 66 decrease for postretirement benefit plans the changes are related to the change in discount rates for all plans and other actuarial assumptions 

the company made cash contributions of approximately 175 to its pension plans in 2013 including voluntary contributions of 130 the company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately 34 in 2014 to offset 2014 benefit payments and administrative costs in excess of investment returns 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized the company records liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under asc topic 740 income taxes the liabilities relate to tax return positions that although supportable by the company may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement the company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change in this regard settlement of any issue or an adverse determination in litigation with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in the company’s annual tax rate conversely favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to the company’s annual tax rate 

new accounting pronouncements 

during the first quarter of 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued guidance for the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income the guidance requires an entity to present information about significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or as a separate disclosure in the notes to the financial statements the company elected to present the requirements in the notes to the financial statements see note 15 the adoption of the new pronouncement did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in july 2013 the fasb issued guidance requiring an entity to net its liability for unrecognized tax benefits against the deferred tax assets for all same jurisdiction net operating losses or similar tax loss carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards a gross presentation will be required only if such carryforwards are not available as of

reporting date to settle any additional income taxes resulting from disallowance of the uncertain tax position or the entity does not intend to use these carryforwards for this purpose the new guidance is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2013 and interim periods within those years this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

there have been no other accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted by the company which are expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

competition for consumer domestic and consumer international 

the company competes in the household and personal care consumer product categories which are highly innovative categories characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and requiring significant advertising and promotion the company competes in these categories primarily on the basis of product innovation and performance brand recognition price value and other consumer benefits consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced such as laundry and household cleaning products as well as certain toothpaste products are subject to significant price competition as a result the company from time to time may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share 

internationally the company’s products compete in similar competitive categories for most of its products 

many of the company’s competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company the sun products corporation the clorox company colgatepalmolive company sc johnson  son inc henkel ag  co kgaa reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson ansell limited pfizer inc bayer ag and alere inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than the company and have the capacity to outspend the company if they attempt to gain market share 

  

product introductions typically involve heavy marketing costs in the year of launch and the company usually is not able to determine whether the new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product line 

because of the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from customers particularly highvolume retailer store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms these concessions or terms could reduce the company’s margins furthermore if the company is unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to its customers they could increase product purchases from competitors and reduce purchases from the company which would harm the company’s sales and profitability

competition for spd 

competition within the specialty chemicals and animal nutrition product lines is intense the specialty chemicals business operates in a competitive environment influenced by capacity utilization customers’ leverage and the impact of raw material and energy costs product introductions typically involve introductory costs in the year of launch and the company usually is not able to determine whether new products and line extensions will be successful until sometime following the introduction of new products or the extension of the product lines the company’s key competitors are solvay chemicals inc fmc corporation and natural soda inc 

distribution for spd 

spd markets sodium bicarbonate and other chemicals to industrial and agricultural customers primarily throughout the us and canada distribution is accomplished through a dedicated sales force supplemented by manufacturer’s representatives and the sales personnel of independent distributors throughout the country the company’s products in this segment are located in company plants and public warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking companies or picked up by customers at the company’s facilities 

  

raw materials and sources of supply 

the company manufactures sodium bicarbonate for both its consumer and specialty products businesses at its plants located at green river wyoming and old fort ohio the primary source of soda ash a basic raw material used by the company in the production of sodium bicarbonate is the mineral trona which is found in abundance in southwestern wyoming near the company’s green river plant the company has adequate trona reserves under mineral leases to support the company’s sodium bicarbonate requirements for the foreseeable future 

the company is party to a partnership agreement with general chemical corporation which mines and processes trona reserves in wyoming through the partnership and related supply and services agreements the company fulfills a substantial amount of its soda ash requirements enabling the company to achieve some of the economies of an integrated business capable of producing sodium bicarbonate and related products from the basic raw material the company also has an agreement for the supply of soda ash from another company the partnership agreement and other supply agreements between the company and general chemical are terminable upon two years notice by either company the company believes that sufficient alternative sources of supply are available 

the company believes that ample sources of raw materials are available for all of its other major products detergent chemicals are used in a variety of the company’s products and are available from a number of sources bottles paper products and clay are available from multiple suppliers although the company chooses to source most of these materials from single sources under longterm supply agreements in order to gain favorable pricing the company also uses a palm oil fraction in its rumen bypass fats products alternative sources of supply are available in case of disruption or termination of the supply agreements 

the cost of surfactants diesel fuel and oilbased raw and packaging materials used primarily in the consumer businesses were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 the cost of soda ash was higher in 2012 than 2011 and the cost of palm fatty acid distillate pfad used in spd was lower in 2012 than 2011 increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact the company’s costs and financial results if the company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers 

the company utilizes the services of third party contract manufacturers around the world for certain products 

patents and trademarks 

the company’s trademarks appear in upper case letters throughout this annual report the company’s trademarks are registered with the us patent and trademark office and also with the trademark offices of many foreign countries the arm  hammer trademark has been used by the company since 1867 and is a valuable asset and important to the successful operation of the company’s business the company’s products are sold under many other valuable trademarks held by the company including trojan nair orajel first response xtra oxiclean spinbrush batiste simply saline feline pine l’il critters and vitafusion the company’s portfolio of trademarks represents substantial goodwill in the businesses using the trademarks 

us patents are currently granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed although the company actively seeks and maintains a number of patents no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole 

customers and order backlog

consolidated net sales the time between receipt of orders and shipment is generally short and as a result backlog is not significant no other customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net sales in the three year period

medical device clearance and approval 

to be commercially distributed in the us a medical device must unless exempt receive clearance or approval from the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdca” lower risk devices are categorized as either class i or ii devices for class ii devices the manufacturer must generally submit a premarket notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution known as a “510k” clearance our condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits are regulated as class ii devices some low risk devices including our spinbrush and arm  hammer battery powered toothbrushes are in class i and are generally exempted from the 510k requirement to obtain 510k clearance a device must be determined to be substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a benchmark device or “predicate” that 

  

is already legally in commercial distribution any modification to a 510k cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a change in its intended use generally requires a new 510k clearance a manufacturer may determine that a new 510k clearance is not required but if the fda disagrees it may retroactively require a 510k clearance and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing or recall the modified device until 510k clearance is obtained 

medical device postmarket regulation 

after a medical device is commercialized numerous regulatory requirements apply including 

 

  

  

  

 otc pharmaceutical 

the company markets overthecounter “otc” pharmaceutical products such as toothpaste antiperspirant and oral analgesics products that are also subject to fda and foreign regulation under the us otc monograph system selected otc pharmaceutical products are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the submission and approval of a new drug application the fda otc monographs include wellknown ingredients and specify requirements for permitted indications required warnings and precautions allowable combinations of ingredients and dosage levels pharmaceutical products marketed under the otc monograph system must conform to specific quality formula and labeling requirements 

all facilities where otc pharmaceutical products are manufactured tested packaged stored or distributed must comply with fda current good manufacturing practice “cgmp” regulations andor regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries where the facilities are located all of the company’s pharmaceutical products are manufactured tested packaged stored and distributed according to cgmp regulations the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that the company’s facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representations made to customers or to regulatory action against the company related to the products made in that facility such as seizure injunction or recall serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against the company that among other things could result in the suspension of production or distribution of the company’s products product seizures loss of certain licenses or other governmental penalties and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or operating results the manufacturer packer or distributor of an otc pharmaceutical product marketed in the us whose name appears on the label of such product is required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of the product 

the company cannot predict whether new legislation regulating the company’s activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on the company’s business 

  

dietary supplements 

the processing formulation safety manufacturing packaging labeling advertising distribution importing selling and storing of dietary supplements are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies including the fda the ftc the cpsc the epa and by various agencies of the states and localities in which the company’s products are sold the fdca governs the composition safety labeling manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements 

generally dietary ingredients that were marketed in the us prior to october 15 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the fda “new” dietary ingredients  ie dietary ingredients that were not marketed in the us before october 15 1994 must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the fda at least 75 days before the initial marketing unless the ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for food without being chemically altered a new dietary ingredient notification must provide evidence of a history of use or other evidence establishing that use of the dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe the fda may determine that a new dietary ingredient notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe such a determination could effectively prevent the marketing of the dietary ingredient on july 5 2011 the fda issued draft guidance governing notification of new dietary ingredients the draft guidance was issued for public comment and not for implementation the guidance if implemented could effectively change the status of dietary ingredients that the industry has marketed as “old” dietary ingredients to “new” dietary ingredients that may require submission of a new dietary ingredient notification 

the fdca permits “statements of nutritional support” to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without fda premarket approval the fda must be notified of those statements within 30 days of marketing among other things the statements may describe the role of a dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function of the body or characterize the documented mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient maintains such structure or function but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose cure mitigate treat or prevent a disease a company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess information substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading if the fda determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim or if the fda determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific evidence or is otherwise false or misleading the claim could not be used and any product bearing the claim could be subject to regulatory action 

the fda’s cgmp regulations govern the manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers all of the company’s dietary supplements are manufactured tested packaged stored and distributed according to cgmp regulations the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that the company’s facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representation made to customers or to regulatory action against the company related to the products made in that facility seizure injunction or recall there remains considerable uncertainty with respect to the fda’s interpretation of the cgmp regulations and their actual implementation in manufacturing facilities the failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cgmp regulations may render products manufactured in that facility adulterated and subjects those products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential fda enforcement actions in addition under recent amendments to the fdca the manufacturing of dietary ingredients contained in dietary supplements will be subject to similar or even more burdensome requirements which will likely increase the costs of dietary ingredients and subject suppliers of such ingredients to more rigorous inspections and enforcement the manufacturer packer or distributor of a dietary supplement marketed in the us whose name appears on the label of the supplement is required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of that supplement to fda 

the ftc exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements the ftc considers whether a product’s advertising claims are accurate truthful and not misleading pursuant to its authority under the federal trade commission act or ftc act the ftc has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary 

  

supplement companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of otherwise false or misleading advertising claims these enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties andor restitution by the companies involved such actions can result in substantial financial penalties and significantly restrict the marketing of a dietary supplement 

legislation may be introduced which if passed would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements the effect of additional domestic or international governmental legislation regulations or administrative orders if and when promulgated cannot be determined new legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards and require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risks and uncertainties as well as others described elsewhere in this annual report could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

 unfavorable and uncertain economic conditions have adversely affected and in the future may adversely affect demand for some of our products resulting in reduced sales volume or a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin products factors that can affect demand include rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior including delays in the timing of tax refunds from the federal government tax increases and the expiration of the payroll tax break in december 2012 that resulted in an increase in social security taxes for us workers while the vast majority of our products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products they may become subject to increasing price competition as recessionary conditions continue moreover some of our products such as laundry additives and batteryoperated toothbrushes are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of our customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs and dollar pet and other specialty stores have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all we regularly review the financial strength of our key customers and where appropriate modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales because the same economic conditions impact many of our suppliers we also regularly conduct a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations where appropriate we intend to identify alternate sources of materials and services to date we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers however a protracted economic downturn that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

 

 we face intense competition from consumer products companies both in the us and in international markets most of our products compete with other widelyadvertised brands within each product category and with private label brands and generic nonbranded products of our customers in certain categories which typically are sold at lower prices 

our products generally compete on the basis of product performance brand recognition price value or other benefits to consumers consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced like many of our products are subject to significant price competition as a result we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase prices by an amount that does not cover manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices or inability to raise prices sufficiently to cover manufacturing cost increases would harm profit margins in addition if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins our results of operations would suffer 

advertising promotion merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions a newly introduced consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising sales promotion and trade merchandising if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position if our advertising marketing and promotional programs are not effective or adequate our sales and volume may be impacted 

many of our competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company the sun products corporation the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel ag  co kgaa reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson alere inc formerly known as inverness medical innovations inc 

  

pfizer inc bayer ag and sc johnson  son inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and therefore have the capacity to outspend us on advertising and promotional activities and introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can in addition our competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by us competitive activity may require us to increase our spending on advertising and promotions andor reduce prices which could lead to reduced profits and adversely affect growth if we lose market share and the markets in which we compete do not grow substantially our sales levels and operating results will decline 

 

 a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our net sales walmart stores inc together with its affiliates “walmart” is our largest customer accounting for approximately 24 of net sales in 2012 23 of net sales in 2011 and 23 of net sales in 2010 our top three customers accounted for approximately 34 of net sales in 2012 33 of net sales in 2011 and 33 of net sales in 2010 we expect that a significant portion of our net sales will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues as a result changes in the strategies of walmart or any of our other largest customers including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products could materially harm our net sales and profitability 

in addition our business is based primarily upon individual sales orders and we rarely enter into longterm contracts with our customers accordingly these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from us at any time and for any reason if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 in recent years we have seen increasing retailer consolidation both in the us and internationally this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailer customers who may demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other requirements on us these business demands may relate to inventory practices logistics or other aspects of the customersupplier relationship some of our customers particularly our highvolume retail store customers have sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms to those customers our margins are reduced further if we are unable to effectively respond to the demands of our customers these customers could reduce their purchases of our products and increase their purchases of products from our competitors which would harm our sales and profitability in addition reductions in inventory by our customers including as a result of consolidations in the retail industry or these customers managing their working capital requirements could result in reduced orders for our products and adversely affect our results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions 

the recent economic downturn also caused many of our customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell and reduce or discontinue certain of our product lines particularly those products that were not number one or two in their category if this continues to occur and we are unable to improve distribution for those products at other customers our results could be adversely affected 

in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains are typically sold at lower prices than branded products as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending our customers have discontinued or reduced distribution of some of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase our customers’ less expensive private label products to the extent customers discontinue or reduce distribution of 

  

our products or our products are adversely affected by our customers’ actions to increase shelf space for their private label products we will focus our efforts on improving distribution with other customers however if our efforts are not effective our results could be adversely affected 

 

 our performance depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and the financial difficulties of our retailer customers consumer products such as those marketed by us are increasingly being sold by club stores and mass merchandisers while sales of consumer products by food and drug stores comprise a smaller proportion of the total volume of consumer products sold sales of our products are stronger in the food and drug channels of trade and not as strong in club stores and mass merchandiser channels although we have taken steps to improve sales to club stores and mass merchandisers if the current trend continues and we are not successful in further improving sales to these channels our financial condition and operating results could suffer 

 

 a significant percentage of our revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition during 2012 approximately 79 of our sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes antiperspirants and deodorants our ability to achieve unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of our products by consumers our ability to drive growth through product innovation investment in our established brands and enhanced merchandising and our ability to capture market share from our competitors if we are unable to increase market share in existing product lines develop product improvements undertake sales marketing and advertising initiatives that expand our product categories and develop acquire or successfully launch new products we may not achieve our sales growth objectives even if we are successful in increasing sales within our product categories a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for our products could have a negative impact on our financial results 

 

 the principal raw materials and packaging we use include surfactants cleaning agents paper products and bottles volatility and increases in the price of raw materials or increases in the costs of energy shipping and other necessary services could significantly affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution in particular during the past few years we have experienced price increases for raw and packaging materials diesel fuel and energy concerns about the adequacy of oil supply in the face of increasing demand continued to affect pricing we have attempted to address these price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of our own products entering into prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and entering into hedge agreements for diesel fuel costs if raw material price increases continue we may not be able to fully offset them especially given the competitive environment this volatility can significantly affect our production cost and could therefore harm our financial condition and operating results 

we use hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices and related fuel surcharges the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to our product costs enabling us to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in diesel fuel prices over the term of the contract however in periods of declining fuel prices the hedge agreements can have the effect of locking us in at above–market prices for fuel 

  

 our future performance and growth depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product line extensions we cannot be certain that we will achieve our innovation goals the successful development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development marketing and promotional expenditures which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance new product development and marketing efforts including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which we have limited or no prior experience have inherent risks these risks include product development or launch delays regulatory approval hurdles and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of our existing products our financial performance could be harmed 

from time to time we have discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs we may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand 

 

 our financial success is directly dependent on the reputation and success of our brands particularly the arm  hammer oxiclean and trojan brands the effectiveness of these brands could suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further our results could be adversely affected if one or more of our leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality or safety issues or other customer or consumer dissatisfaction especially if such dissatisfaction were to be broadly disseminated including through the use of social media 

additionally claims made in our marketing campaigns may become subject to litigation alleging false advertising which if successful could cause us to alter our marketing plans and may materially and adversely affect sales or result in the imposition of significant damages against us 

 

 we are from time to time subject to product liability claims we may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by our products including losses or injuries caused by raw materials or other components provided by third party suppliers that are included in our products claims could be based on allegations that among other things our products contain contaminants are improperly labeled or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances whether or not successful product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm our sales and operating results and the reputation of our brands in addition if one of our products is found to be defective or noncompliant with applicable rules or regulations we could be required to withdraw or recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability and product recall insurance coverage that also covers product withdrawals potential product liability claims and withdrawal and recall costs may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

 the manufacturing processing formulation packaging labeling marketing distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the ftc the united states department of agriculture the epa and the cpsc in addition our operations are subject to the oversight of the epa the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold 

  

in particular the fda regulates the formulation safety manufacturing packaging labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits battery operated toothbrushes overthecounter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements including vitamins and minerals the fda also exercises oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of our other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that we use to manufacture regulated products and may identify compliance issues that would require us to make certain changes in our manufacturing facilities and processes the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to regulatory action against the products made in that facility including seizure injunction or recall as well as to possible action against the owner of the facilitymanufacturer we may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until the compliance issue has been remediated as a result our business could be adversely affected 

likewise any future determination by the fda or a similar foreign agency or by us in reviewing our compliance with applicable rules and regulations that our products or quality systems do not comply with applicable regulations could result in future compliance activities including product withdrawals or recalls import detentions injunctions preventing the shipment of products or other enforcement actions for example the fda may determine that a particular claim that we use to support the marketing of a product is not substantiated may not accept the evidence of safety for a new product that we may wish to market and may challenge the safety or effectiveness of existing products based on among other things changes in formulations inadequate stability or “shelflife” consumer complaints or improper labeling similarly we may identify these or other issues in internal compliance reviews of our operations and the operations and products of vendors and acquired companies these other issues may include the identification of contaminants or noncompliant levels of particular ingredients we are in the process of assessing the manufacturing advertising labeling and stability of the products of avid health which we recently acquired as a result of this and similar internal reviews we may be obligated to among other things revise or institute enhanced compliance procedures revise manufacturing processes product formulations or labeling or effect product withdrawals or recalls any of the foregoing could subject us to adverse publicity force us to incur unanticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time congress the fda the ftc or other federal state local or foreign legislative and regulatory authorities may impose additional laws or regulations that apply to us repeal laws or regulations that we consider favorable to us or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations we are not able to predict the nature of such future laws regulations repeals or interpretations or to predict the effect additional governmental regulation when and if it occurs would have on our business in the future such developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated additional recordkeeping requirements increased documentation of the properties of certain products additional or different labeling additional scientific substantiation expanded adverse event reporting or other new requirements any such developments could increase our costs significantly and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 our distribution of condoms under the trojan brand and other trademarks is regulated by the fda certain of our condoms and similar condoms sold by our competitors contain the spermicide nonoxynol9 “n9” some interested groups have issued reports that n9 should not be used rectally or for multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse in late 2008 the fda issued final labeling guidance for latex condoms but excluded n9 lubricated condoms from the guidance while we await further fda guidance on n9 lubricated condoms we believe that our present labeling for condoms with n9 is compliant with the overall objectives of the fda’s guidance and that condoms with n9 will remain a viable contraceptive choice for those couples who wish to use them however we cannot predict the nature of the labeling that ultimately will be required by the fda if the 

  

fda or state governments eventually promulgate rules that prohibit or restrict the use of n9 in condoms such as new labeling requirements we could incur costs from obsolete products packaging or raw materials and sales of condoms could decline which in turn could decrease our earnings 

 

 we must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations we currently are subject to environmental regulatory proceedings involving our brazilian subsidiary which has been fined the equivalent of approximately 24 million in the proceedings our brazilian subsidiary is contesting the fine it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future particularly with respect to our operations in brazil that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

 our international operations subject us to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to commercialize our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position in all foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions 

in addition we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar outside of the us sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the euro british pound brazilian real canadian dollar mexican peso chinese yuan and australian dollar a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow the company from time to time enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed intercompany sales or purchases denominated in the us dollar canadian dollar british pound and euro 

 

 as part of our business strategy we seek to acquire or invest in businesses that offer products services or technologies that are complementary to ours we have made several acquisitions in recent years including businesses previously operated by del pharmaceuticals inc and orange glo international inc the simply 

  

saline nasal moisturizer product line the feline pine natural cat litter product line and the batiste dry shampoo product line most recently we completed the acquisition of avid health a manufacturer of gummy form dietary supplements sold under the l’il critters and vitafusion brands 

we may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future however we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive valuations obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions in addition any acquisitions or investments including the avid health acquisition the integration of which is still ongoing entail various risks including the difficulty of entering new markets the challenges of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the ongoing business of the acquired company the need to review and if necessary upgrade processes of the acquired company to conform to our own processes and generally our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment any of these risks may divert management and other resources require us to incur unanticipated costs or delay the anticipated positive impact on our business and results of the acquisition the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent we acquire businesses that have standalone operations that cannot easily be integrated or operations or sources of supply outside of the us and canada for which products are manufactured locally by third parties these factors could harm our financial condition and operating results 

acquired companies or operations or newlycreated ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made in addition future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the potentially dilutive issuances of new equity by us or the incurrence of additional debt or contingent liabilities all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and resources from other matters that are critical to our operations 

 

 as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 9032 million of total consolidated indebtedness this amount of indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes if new debt is added to the current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify any decision regarding our future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time including our credit rating 

 

 our ability to repay and refinance our indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends on our cash flow in addition our ability to pay cash dividends depends on cash flow and net earnings our cash flow and net earnings are often subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors 

  

beyond our control and such factors may limit our ability to repay indebtedness declare and pay cash dividends and repatriate foreign earnings in a costeffective manner a failure to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

 although our board of directors has authorized share repurchase programs and recently increased the amount of the quarterly cash dividends payable on our common stock any determinations by us to continue to repurchase the common stock or by our board of directors to continue to pay cash dividends on the common stock will be based primarily upon our financial condition results of operations business requirements price of the common stock in the case of the repurchase program and our board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase program and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs in the event we do not declare a quarterly dividend or discontinue our share repurchases our stock price could be adversely affected 

 

 in recent years the banking system and financial markets have experienced severe disruption including among other things bank failures and consolidations severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades declines in asset valuations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these conditions present the following risks to us among others 

 

  

 although we believe that our operating cash flows together with our access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity the inability of one or more institutions to fulfill their funding obligations under the credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

 

 our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized if the actual amount of our future taxable income is less than the amount we are currently projecting with respect to specific tax jurisdictions or if there is a change in the time period within which the deferred tax asset becomes deductible we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets the recording of a valuation allowance would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on our operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances which would have either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate 

  

 significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we provide for uncertain tax positions with respect to tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards mandated by applicable accounting guidance fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results we are regularly under audit by tax authorities and although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in addition when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

 

 the market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and brand names including arm  hammer trojan and oxiclean we own the material trademarks brand names and patents used in connection with the marketing and distribution of our major products both in the us and in other countries accordingly we rely on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights although most of our material intellectual property is registered in the us and in certain foreign countries in which we operate we cannot be sure that our intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or if necessary successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future and we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties infringe our intellectual property rights they may dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace which could diminish the value that consumers associate with our brands and harm our sales our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

 our operations as well as the operations of our third party manufacturers suppliers and customers may be subject to disruption from a variety of causes including work stoppages material shortages financial difficulties acts of war terrorism pandemics fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business for example as a result of hurricane sandy in october 2012 certain of our operations and the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers including third party information technology service providers were affected by the loss of electricity and other disruptions to our and their businesses the financial impact of such losses and disruptions did not have a material adverse effect on our business but future events may negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to conduct our business these systems include but are not limited to programs and processes relating 

  

to internal communications and communications with other parties ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers billing customers and receiving and applying payment processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements collecting and storing customer consumer employee investor and other stakeholder information and personal data and other processes necessary to manage our business 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including advanced persistent threats pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data our information technology systems networks or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or we could suffer a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages and security breaches although we have business continuity plans in place to address service interruptions if our business continuity plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct our operations which may adversely affect our business 

any business interruptions or data security breaches including cyber security breaches resulting in private data disclosure could damage our reputation and could also adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows further negative postings or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our reputation as could the disclosure of nonpublic company sensitive information through social media 

 

 our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations this effect could be exacerbated if any officers or other key personnel left as a group our success also depends in part on our continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future

brazil environmental matters 

in 2000 the company acquired majority ownership in its brazilian subsidiary quimica geral do nordeste sa “qgn” the acquired operations included an inorganic salt manufacturing plant which began site operations in the late 1970’s located on the site were two closed landfills two active landfills and a pond for the management of the process waste streams in 2009 qgn was advised by the environmental authority in the state of bahia the institute of the environment “ima” that the plant was discharging contaminants into an adjacent creek after learning of the discharge qgn took immediate action to cease the discharge and retained two nationally recognized environmental firms to prepare a site investigation  remedial action plan “sira” the sira report was submitted by qgn to ima in april 2010 the report concluded that the likely sources of the discharge were the failure of the pond and closed landfills qgn ceased site operations in august 2010 in november 2010 ima responded to qgn’s recommendation for an additional study by issuing a notification requiring a broad range of remediation measures the “remediation notification” which included the shutdown and removal of two onsite landfills in addition despite repeated discussions with ima at qgn’s request to consider qgn’s proposed remediation alternatives in december 2010 ima imposed a fine of five million brazilian real approximately us 24 million for the discharge of contaminants above allowable limits the description of the fine included a reference to aggravating factors that may indicate that local “management’s intent” was considered in determining the severity of the fine which could result in criminal liability for members of local management in january 2011 qgn filed with ima an administrative defense to the fine suspending any enforcement activities pending its defense ima has not yet formally responded to qgn’s administrative defense 

with respect to the remediation notification qgn engaged in discussions with ima during which qgn asserted that a number of the remediation measures including the removal of the landfills and the timeframes for implementation were not appropriate and requested that the remediation notification be withdrawn in response in february 2011 ima issued a revised remediation notification the “revised remediation notification” providing for further site analysis by qgn including further study of the integrity of the landfills the revised remediation notification did not include a requirement to remove the landfills however it did not foreclose the possibility of such requirement qgn has responded to the revised remediation notification providing further information regarding the remediation measures and is in discussions with the institute of environment and waste management “inema” successor to ima to seek agreement on an appropriate remediation plan in mid2011 qgn consistent with the revised remediation notice began an additional site investigation and capped the two active landfills with an impervious synthetic cover in 2012 qgn drained the waste pond discussions are continuing with inema concerning the potential removal of the landfills and other remediation activities as well as the fine 

as a result of the foregoing events the company accrued approximately 3 million in 2009 and 48 million in 2010 for remediation fines and related costs as of december 31 2012 qgn has spent approximately 25 million on remediation activities despite inema’s informal indications to the company that it may not require the removal of the landfills it remains reasonably possible that inema will require such removal and the company could be unsuccessful in appealing such decision the company estimates the cost of such landfill removal would be in the range of 30 million to 50 million

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements 

overview 

our business 

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of household personal care and specialty products we sell our consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets mass merchandisers wholesale clubs drugstores convenience stores dollar pet and other specialty stores and websites all of which sell the products to consumers we also sell specialty products to industrial customers and distributors the company focuses its consumer products marketing efforts principally on its eight “power brands” these wellrecognized brand names include arm  hammer used in multiple product categories such as baking soda cat litter carpet deodorization and laundry detergent trojan condoms xtra laundry detergent oxiclean stain removers and cleaning solutions nair depilatories first response home pregnancy and ovulation test kits orajel oral analgesics and spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrushes 

we operate our business in three primary segments consumer domestic consumer international and specialty products division “spd” the consumer domestic segment includes the eight power brands and other household and personal care products such as scrub free kaboom and orange glo cleaning products l’il critters and vitafusion dietary supplements feline pine cat litter answer home pregnancy and ovulation test kits arrid antiperspirant closeup and aim toothpastes and simply saline nasal saline moisturizer the consumer international segment primarily sells a variety of personal care products some of which use the same brand names as our domestic product lines in international markets including canada france australia the united kingdom mexico brazil and china the spd segment is the largest us producer of sodium bicarbonate which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial institutional medical and food applications this segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products in 2012 the consumer domestic consumer international and spd segments represented approximately 74 17 and 9 respectively of our consolidated net sales 

industry trends uncertainties and our strategic response 

our ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for our products which is affected by general economic conditions in our markets in 2012 many of the markets in which we operate continued to experience general economic softness and weak or choppy consumer demand although our consumer products generally are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products the continued economic downturn has reduced demand in many of our categories particularly those in personal care and affected our sales in recent periods we expect challenging conditions of the last several years may persist in 2013 primarily due to continued weak consumer demand in many of our categories and continuing pricing pressures to continue to deliver attractive results for our shareholders in this environment we intend to remain aggressive in our pursuit of several key strategic initiatives and specifically to maintain competitive marketing and trade spending manage our cost structure continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursue strategic acquisitions we also intend to continue to balance our product sales both geographically in an attempt to mitigate the impact of weakness in any one area and between premium and value brand offerings to appeal to a wide range of consumers 

over the past 12 years we have diversified from an almost exclusively us business to a global company with approximately 21 of our sales derived from foreign countries we have operations in seven countries canada mexico uk france australia brazil and china and export to over 80 other countries in 2012 we 

  

benefited from our concentration in north america in light of the economic downturn in europe and the strengthening us dollar however we have continued and will continue to focus on expanding our global business 

generally weak economic conditions have caused slow growth or declines in most of our consumer product categories especially in personal care some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings primarily in the dietary supplements diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category in addition an increasing portion of our product categories are being sold by club stores and mass merchandisers all of these customer responses have placed downward pressure on our sales and gross margins 

our strategy in response to these customer actions is to continue to focus on strengthening our key brands including our “power brands” and certain other important brands such as l’il critters and vitafusion dietary supplements with market leading positions in their categories through the launch of innovative new products increased marketing spending and strong sales execution despite challenging economic conditions and customer responses to these conditions we were able to grow market share in six of eight of our “power brands” in 2012 including laundry detergent our product portfolio consists of both premium 60 and value 40 brands which we believe enables us to succeed in a range of economic environments our value brands have performed strongly during economic downturns and we intend to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among costconscious consumers in 2012 we launched innovative new products in both existing and new categories including arm  hammer ultra last a longer lasting clumping cat litter oxiclean dishwashing booster which removes cloudy film and food particles on glasses and dishes a line of toothpaste for sensitive teeth under the arm  hammer brand and arm  hammer tooth tunes battery operated toothbrushes with proprietary technology that delivers music while brushing in 2013 we also plan to increase marketing spending focused behind the launch of innovative new premium products in our power brands including arm  hammer ultra power 4x a concentrated form of liquid laundry detergent and a line of lubrication products under our trojan brand which we expect will continue to drive market share gains 

we also continued to experience high raw material and energy costs throughout 2012 historically we have been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent by passing along some of these cost increases to our customers we have also entered into prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel costs however the increased price competition that we have experienced in recent periods has diminished the impact of some of these measures and affected our gross margins maintaining tight controls on our overhead costs has been a hallmark of our company and has enabled us to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions 

the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of our overall strategy our failure to effectively implement this initiative including a failure to integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause us to incur material asset writedowns we actively seek acquisitions that fit our guidelines and our strong financial position provides us with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in addition our ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage our existing infrastructure have enabled us to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions since 2001 we have acquired seven of our eight current “power brands” in 2012 we completed the acquisition of our l’il critters and vitafusion dietary supplements

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements 

  

requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty they are based on the company’s historical experience its observation of trends in industry information provided by its customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate the company’s significant accounting policies and estimates are described below 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves 

virtually all of the company’s revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered or picked up by our customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company’s products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements an approximately 21 million difference in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns the company uses experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if the company’s estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 67 million while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 the company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately 40 million 82 million and 68 million respectively based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information these adjustments are immaterial relative to the amount of trade promotion expense incurred annually by the company 

impairment of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets and property plant and equipment 

carrying values of goodwill trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment  for finite intangible assets the company assesses business triggering events the company’s impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trademarks and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired the result of the company’s annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units in addition there were no intangible impairment charges for the three year period ended december 31 2012 

it is possible that the company’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if for example i the businesses or brands do not perform as 

  

projected ii overall economic conditions in 2013 or future years vary from current assumptions including changes in discount rates iii business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions iv investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or v enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions of comparable companies were to decline resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment  the company’s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the longlived assets are largely independent of other groups of company assets and liabilities the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology the continued success of product lines and future volume revenue and expense growth rates the company conducts annual reviews to identify idle and underutilized equipment and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when an impairment is indicated the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and fair value 

the company recognized charges related to plant impairment and equipment obsolescence which occurs in the ordinary course of business during the three year period ended december 31 2012 as follows 

 

 the 2012 consumer domestic and spd charges are due to the idling of equipment and the consumer international charge is due to the cancelation of a software project the 2011 consumer domestic charge is a result of the idling of equipment the 2011 spd charge is associated with the company’s decision to explore strategic options for the specialty chemical business in brazil in 2010 the company recorded a plant asset impairment charge of approximately 31 million representing the carrying value of certain assets associated with its brazil subsidiary the charge is a result of a reduction in forecasted sales volume which has negatively impacted projected profitability the charge is included in cost of sales in the spd segment the other charges in 2010 are due to the idling of certain equipment the estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations nevertheless future outcomes may differ materially from management’s estimates if the company’s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized then the company’s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 

inventory valuation 

when appropriate the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value which reflects any costs to sell or dispose the company identifies any slow moving obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is required to establish a new carrying value the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company’s products technological changes and new product introductions in addition the company’s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction 

  

of the number of stock keeping units skus the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were 57 million at december 31 2012 and 47 million at december 31 2011 

valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs 

the company’s pension costs relate solely to its international operations both pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in benefit cost valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s international pension and domesticinternational postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets 

the discount rate is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the company’s pension plans and postretirement plans the company refers to an applicable index and expected term of benefit payments to select a discount rate at which it believes the plan benefits could be effectively settled the company’s weighted average discount rate for its international pension plans as of december 31 2012 is 416 as compared to 473 used at december 31 2011 based on the published rate as of december 31 2012 that matched estimated cash flows for the plans the company used a weighted average discount rate of 389 for its postretirement plans as compared to 432 used at december 31 2011 

the expected longterm rate of return on international pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the historical trend the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans the asset mix of the plans and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation based on these factors the company’s weighted average expected longterm rate of return for assets of its pension plans for 2012 was 535 compared to 587 used in 2011 a 50 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return would result in an approximate 04 million change in pension expense for 2013 

as noted above changes in assumptions used by management may result in material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs in 2012 other comprehensive income reflected a 59 million increase in its remaining pension plan obligations and a 19 million increase for postretirement benefit plans the changes are primarily related to the change in discount rates for all plans 

the company made cash contributions of approximately 44 million to its pension plans in 2012 the company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately 44 million in 2013 to offset 2013 benefit payments and administrative costs in excess of investment returns 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized the company records liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under asc topic 740 income taxes the liabilities relate to tax return positions that although supportable by the company may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement the company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and 

  

subject to change in this regard settlement of any issue or an adverse determination in litigation with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate conversely favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate 

new accounting pronouncements 

during the second quarter of 2012 the company adopted new guidance on reporting and presentation of comprehensive income the new guidance requires an entity to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement together with components of net income or in a separate financial statement immediately following the income statement the company elected to provide consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements see the consolidated statements of income consolidated statements of comprehensive income and related note 15 for additional information the new requirements did not have an impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

on july 27 2012 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance to simplify how entities test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment the new guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test the new pronouncement did not have any impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

there have been no other accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted by the company which are expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows accounting pronouncements that became effective during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 did not require the company to include additional financial statement disclosures and had no impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows

operating costs 

the company’s gross profit for 2012 was 12914 million a 769 million increase as compared to 2011 the gross profit increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes and contributions from the acquired product lines inhouse production of unit dose detergent and the company’s new manufacturing and distribution facility in victorville california the “victorville facility” partially offset by unfavorable pricing and mix higher commodity costs that were partially offset by productivity improvement programs and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates gross margin was 442 in 2012 as well as in 2011 gross margin was favorably impacted by manufacturing cost reduction projects partially offset by higher commodity costs and an inventory stepup charge related to the avid health acquisition

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” expenses for 2012 were 3890 million an increase of 212 million as compared to 2011 due to costs associated with the avid health acquisition higher costs for salaries and fringe benefits costs associated with the company’s new headquarter facility and unfavorable foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower legal expenses

the volume change reflects increased sales of consumer products sold in the consumer domestic and consumer international segments spd volumes were unchanged pricing had minimal impact on total net sales as favorable pricing for spd was offset by the unfavorable pricing for consumer domestic and consumer international sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 benefited from a timing shift in customer buying patterns from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 in advance of the january 1 2012 information system implementation in the us the impact on income before income taxes on these sales was not material the discontinued product line reflects the company’s decision in late 2010 to cease a foreign subsidiary’s sale of a certain chemical product line the impact of the discontinued product line on income before income taxes was not material other components of the net sales increase reflect the company’s change in delivery arrangements with certain customers at the beginning of the second quarter of 2010 which resulted in a reduction in net sales due to a transportation allowance for a customer pickup program previously the cost to ship product was included in cost of sales 

operating costs 

the company’s gross profit was 12145 million in 2011 a 567 million increase as compared to 2010 the gross profit increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes contributions from the acquired product lines slightly favorable pricing the effect of cost reduction programs and favorable foreign exchange rates partially offset by higher commodity costs and 3 million of charges associated with the decision to explore strategic alternatives for the chemical business in brazil price increases for detergent and condoms mitigated a portion of the significant increases in the cost of resins surfactants and latex the 2010 gross profit includes charges for environmental remediation asset impairment and plant shutdown costs of 76 million at the company’s brazil subsidiary gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 442 as compared to 447 in 2010 this decrease is principally due to higher commodity costs an unfavorable product mix and higher trade promotion spending partially offset by manufacturing cost reduction projects

other income and expenses 

in 2011 equity in earnings of affiliates was 100 million as compared to 50 million in 2010 the increase is due to higher equity income from the company’s armand products company joint venture primarily as a result of lower costs of a key raw material 

other expense was approximately 12 million in 2011 as compared to other expense of 46 million in 2010 which reflects the 2010 writeoff of approximately 45 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the company’s prepayment of variable and subordinated debt see the “liquidity and capital resources” below in this management’s discussion and analysis for further information 

interest expense for 2011 decreased 191 million compared to 2010 the decline was due to lower average debt outstanding as a result of the company’s repayment of debt at the end of 2010 refinancing of its bond debt 

  

and the reversal of interest accruals following the settlement of a state tax audit the 2010 amount includes a 30 million reversal of interest accruals associated with certain tax reserves following the settlement of a us internal revenue service “irs” audit and the lapse of applicable statues of limitations which was offset by a 43 million charge associated with the termination of the company’s interest rate collar and interest swap agreements

that are valuedpriced such as laundry and household cleaning products as well as certain toothpaste products are subject to significant price competition as a result the company from time to time may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share 

internationally the company’s products compete in similar competitive categories for most of its products 

many of the company’s competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company sun products corporation the clorox company colgatepalmolive company sc johnson  son inc henkel ag  co kgaa reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson ansell limited and inverness medical innovations inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than the company and have the capacity to outspend the company if they attempt to gain market share 

product introductions typically involve heavy marketing costs in the year of launch and the company usually is not able to determine whether the new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product line 

because of the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from customers particularly highvolume retail store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms these concessions or terms could reduce the company’s margins furthermore if the company is unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to its trade customers the customers could increase product purchases from competitors and reduce purchases from the company which would harm the company’s sales and profitability

competition for spd 

competition within the specialty chemicals and animal nutrition product lines is intense the specialty chemicals business operates in a competitive environment influenced by capacity utilization customers’ leverage and the impact of raw material and energy costs product introductions typically involve introductory costs in the year of launch and the company usually is not able to determine whether new products and line extensions will be successful until sometime following the introduction of new products or the extension of the product lines 

distribution for spd 

spd markets sodium bicarbonate and other chemicals to industrial and agricultural customers primarily throughout the united states and canada distribution is accomplished through a dedicated sales force supplemented by manufacturer’s representatives and the sales personnel of independent distributors throughout the country the company’s products in this segment are located in company plants and public warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking companies or picked up by customers at the company’s facilities 

  

raw materials and sources of supply 

the company manufactures sodium bicarbonate for both its consumer and specialty products businesses at its plants located at green river wyoming and old fort ohio the primary source of soda ash a basic raw material used by the company in the production of sodium bicarbonate is the mineral trona which is found in abundance in southwestern wyoming near the company’s green river plant the company has adequate trona reserves under mineral leases to support the company’s sodium bicarbonate requirements for the foreseeable future 

the company is party to a partnership agreement with general chemical corporation which mines and processes trona reserves in wyoming through the partnership and related supply and services agreements the company fulfills a substantial amount of its soda ash requirements enabling the company to achieve some of the economies of an integrated business capable of producing sodium bicarbonate and related products from the basic raw material the company also has an agreement for the supply of soda ash from another company the partnership agreement and other supply agreements between the company and general chemical are terminable upon two years notice by either company the company believes that sufficient alternative sources of supply are available 

the company believes that ample sources of raw materials are available for all of its other major products detergent chemicals are used in a variety of the company’s products and are available from a number of sources bottles paper products and clay are available from multiple suppliers although the company chooses to source most of these materials from single sources under longterm supply agreements in order to gain favorable pricing the company also uses a palm oil fraction in its rumen bypass fats products alternative sources of supply are available in case of disruption or termination of the supply agreements 

the trend of higher raw material costs continued into 2011 as a result the cost of surfactants diesel fuel palm fatty acid distillate pfad latex corrugated paper and oilbased raw and packaging materials used in the household and specialty products businesses were all higher in 2011 than 2010 additional increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact the company’s costs and financial results if the company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risks and uncertainties as well as others described elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

 uncertainty about current global economic conditions has adversely affected demand for some of our products factors that can affect demand include rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior while the company’s products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products they may become subject to increasing price competition as recessionary conditions continue moreover some of our products such as laundry additives and batteryoperated toothbrushes are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of our customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs pet specialty stores and dollar stores have experienced declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all in response we regularly conduct a review of the financial strength of our key customers as appropriate we modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales because the same economic conditions are impacting many of our suppliers we also regularly conduct a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations where appropriate we intend to identify alternate sources of materials and services to date we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers however a continued economic decline that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our operations and sales 

in recent years the banking system and financial markets have experienced severe disruption including among other things bank failures and consolidations severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades declines in asset valuations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these conditions present the following risks to us among others 

 

  

 we have not been notified of any circumstances that would prevent any participating financial institution from funding our credit agreement however under current or future circumstances such constraints may exist although we believe that our operating cash flows together with our access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity the inability of one or more institutions to fulfill their funding obligations under the credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

  

 the economic crisis caused many of our customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell which has resulted in their reduction or discontinuance of certain of our product lines particularly those products that are not number one or two in their category if this occurs and we are unable to improve distribution for those products at other customers our company’s results could be adversely affected 

in addition many of our customers sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products that we sell as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending our customers have discontinued or reduced distribution of some of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase our customers’ less expensive private label products to the extent some of our products are discontinued or are adversely affected by our trade customers’ actions to increase shelf space for their private label products we are focusing our efforts on improving distribution with other customers our results could be adversely affected if our efforts are not effective 

 

 our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands particularly the arm  hammer oxiclean and trojan brands the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further our results could be adversely affected if one of our leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues 

 

 we strive to introduce new products that are based on current and new technology the development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development marketing and promotional expenditures which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of our existing products our financial performance could be harmed 

 

 from time to time we have discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs we may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand moreover product quality defects or safety concerns could result in product recalls product returns or recalls writeoffs or shutdown costs would reduce sales cash flow and earnings and damage the product’s brand reputation 

 

 during 2011 approximately 79 of our sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes antiperspirants and deodorants our unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of our products by consumers product innovation and our ability to capture market share from competitors we may not succeed in implementing strategies to increase domestic revenues 

  

the consumer products industry particularly the laundry detergent personal care and air deodorizer categories is intensely competitive to protect existing market share or to capture increased market share we may need to increase expenditures for promotion and advertising and to introduce and establish new products increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing market share and could result in lower sales and profits many of our competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company sun products corporation the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel ag  co kgaa reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson inverness medical innovations inc and sc johnson  son inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and therefore have the capacity to outspend us should they attempt to gain market share if we lose market share and the markets in which we compete do not grow substantially our sales levels and operating results will decline 

 

 consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced like many of our products are subject to significant price competition as a result we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase prices by an amount that does not cover manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices or inability to raise prices sufficiently to cover manufacturing cost increases in response to these pressures would harm profit margins in addition if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins our results of operations would suffer 

because of the competitive environment facing many of our customers particularly our highvolume retail store customers have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms our margins are reduced further if we are unable to maintain terms that are acceptable to our trade customers these trade customers could reduce purchases of our products and increase purchases of products from our competitors which would harm our sales and profitability 

 

 from time to time our retail customers may reduce inventory levels in managing their working capital requirements any reduction in inventory levels by our retail customers will result in reduced orders and harm our operating results for the financial periods affected by the reductions in particular continued consolidation within the retail industry could potentially reduce inventory levels maintained by our retail customers which could result in reduced orders and adversely affect our results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions 

 

 our performance also depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and by the financial difficulties of retailers consumer products such as those marketed by us are increasingly being sold by club stores and mass merchandisers while sales of consumer products by food and drug stores comprise a smaller proportion of the total volume of consumer products sold sales of our products are stronger in the food and drug channels of trade and not as strong in club stores and mass merchandiser channels although we have taken steps to improve sales to club stores and mass merchandisers if we are not successful in further improving sales to these channels and the current trend continues our financial condition and operating results could suffer 

 

 walmart together with its affiliates is our largest customer accounting for approximately 23 of net sales in 2011 23 of net sales in 2010 and 22 of net sales in 2009 our top three customers accounted for 

  

approximately 33 of net sales in 2011 33 of net sales in 2010 and 32 of net sales in 2009 the loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by walmart and its affiliates or any of our other largest customers would harm our sales and profitability 

 

 as of december 31 2011 we had 2523 million of total consolidated indebtedness our failure to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

 we have made several acquisitions in recent years including businesses previously operated by del pharmaceuticals inc and orange glo international inc the simply saline nasal moisturizer product line the feline pine natural cat litter product line and the batiste dry shampoo product line we may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future any future acquisitions or investments would entail various risks including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of our ongoing business and generally our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent we acquire businesses that have stand alone operations that cannot easily be integrated or operations or sources of supply outside of the united states and canada for which products are manufactured locally by third parties these factors could harm our financial condition and operating results any future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the issuance of new equity by us or the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and divert other resources from other matters that are critical to our operations 

 

 our distribution of condoms under the trojan and other trademarks is regulated by the fda certain of our condoms and similar condoms sold by our competitors contain the spermicide nonoxynol9 “n9” some interested groups have issued reports that n9 should not be used rectally or for multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse in late 2008 the fda issued final labeling guidance for latex condoms but excluded n9 lubricated condoms from the guidance while we await further fda guidance on n9 lubricated condoms we believe that our present labeling for condoms with n9 is compliant with the overall objectives of the fda’s guidance and that condoms with n9 will remain a viable contraceptive choice for those couples who wish to use them however we cannot predict the nature of the labeling that ultimately will be required by the fda if the fda or state governments eventually promulgate rules that prohibit or restrict the use of n9 in condoms such as new labeling requirements we could incur costs from obsolete products packaging or raw materials and sales of condoms could decline which in turn could decrease our earnings 

 

 our operations as well as the operations of our third party manufacturers and significant suppliers may be subject to disruption from a variety of causes including work stoppages financial difficulties acts of war terrorism pandemics fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters if a major disruption were to occur at our operations it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

similar consequences may result with regard to disruptions in the operations of our third party manufacturers or suppliers some of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business 

 

 increases in the prices of raw materials such as surfactants which are cleaning agents palm oil paper products and bottles or increases in energy costs could significantly affect our profit margins in particular during the past few years we have experienced extraordinary price increases for raw and packaging materials diesel fuel and energy concerns about the adequacy of oil supply in the face of increasing demand continued to affect pricing we use surfactants and bottles in the manufacture and marketing of laundry and household cleaning products we use paper products for packaging in many of our consumer and specialty chemical products we use palm oil in certain of our animal nutrition products we have attempted to address these price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of our own products entering into prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and entering into hedge agreements for diesel fuel costs if raw material price increases continue we may not be able to fully offset them this could harm our financial condition and operating results 

we use hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices and related fuel surcharges the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to our product costs enabling us to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in diesel fuel prices over the term of the contract however in periods of declining fuel prices the hedge agreements can have the effect of increasing our expenditures for fuel 

 

 the manufacturing processing formulation packaging labeling marketing and sale of our products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the federal trade commission “ftc” and the consumer product safety commission in addition our operations are subject to the oversight of the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold 

in particular the fda regulates the safety manufacturing labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits battery operated toothbrushes and overthecounter pharmaceuticals the fda also exercises oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of our other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that we use to manufacture regulated products and may observe compliance issues that would require us to make certain changes in our manufacturing facilities and processes the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to regulatory action against the products made in that facility including seizure injunction or recall as well as to possible action against the manufacturer we may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until the compliance issue has been remediated as a result our business could be adversely affected 

for example the fda issued a warning letter to us dated may 16 2011 “warning letter” following an inspection of our princeton new jersey headquarters the warning letter stated that our medical device reporting “mdr” procedure does not properly identify all required reportable events the warning letter also criticized our proposals for addressing inadequacies previously identified by the fda as to our complaint handling process in response we proposed several corrective actions that were accepted by the fda and are 

  

engaged in further discussions with the fda towards resolving the issue relating to our complaint handling process in addition partly in response to fda’s stated concerns we made product and labeling changes in 2011 and issued a december 2011 safety notice advising consumers about the proper use of spinbrush toothbrushes to avoid injuries associated with improper use of the product 

on february 13 2012 at the conclusion of an inspection of our princeton facility fda issued a notice of inspectional observations also known as a “483 report” containing several observations including a repeat of an issue identified in a previous 483 report and in the warning letter namely a failure to properly identify all required reportable events in addition the 483 report addressed inadequacies in procedures and processes related to corrective and preventive actions complaint handling maintenance of a quality system record and establishment of records of acceptable suppliers we are preparing a response to the 483 report and intend to fully cooperate in resolving fda’s regulatory concerns on february 16 2012 the fda issued a safety communication warning consumers “of serious injuries and potential hazards associated with the use of spinbrush” we plan to cooperate with the fda to address the matters raised in the safety communication warning 

there is no assurance that the fda will not take further enforcement action in connection with the foregoing matters or that additional safety notices or recalls of our spinbrush product will not be required either additional enforcement action or additional safety notices or recalls if they were to occur could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

likewise any future determination by the fda or similar foreign agency that our products or quality systems do not comply with applicable regulations could result in future compliance activities including product recalls import detentions injunctions preventing the shipment of products or other enforcement actions and associated adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our international operations including the production of overthecounter drug products are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which we manufacture or market goods changes in product standards or manufacturing requirements in any of these jurisdictions could require us to make certain modifications to our operations or product formulations or to cease manufacturing certain products completely the effect of the regulatory environment in foreign countries on our overthecounter and medical devices may affect our ability to market and to make competitive claims for our products as a result our international business could be adversely affected 

 

 our international operations subject us to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in all foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the united states and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flow into us dollars outside the united states sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the euro british pound brazilian real canadian dollar mexican peso chinese yuan and australian dollar a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow 

 

 we must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and we currently are subject to environmental regulatory proceedings involving our brazilian subsidiary which has been fined the equivalent of approximately 3 million in the proceedings our brazilian subsidiary is contesting the fine it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future particularly with respect to our operation in brazil that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

 we are from time to time subject to product liability claims we may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by our products claims could be based on allegations that among other things our products contain contaminants provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances product liability claims and recalls also could result in negative publicity that could harm our sales and operating results and the reputation of our brands in addition if one of our products is found to be defective we could be required to recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability and product recall insurance coverage potential product liability claims and recall costs may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

 we rely on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or if necessary successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

 we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to interact with internal personnel and customers and suppliers and other persons these interactions include but are not limited to ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements and other processes necessary to manage our business our systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages and security breaches although we have business continuity plans in place to address service interruptions if our business continuity plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely affect our business in addition we have recently completed information systems upgrades in the united states and canada which affect our ordering shipping and billing systems in those countries and plan to institute similar upgrades in 2012 if the new system does not function properly our ability to order supplies process and deliver customer orders and process and receive payments for products sold in regions in which we conduct the substantial majority of our business could be limited which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

any business interruptions or data security breaches including cyber security breaches resulting in private data disclosure could damage the company’s reputation and could also adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow further negative postings or comments about us on any social networking web site could damage our reputation 

 

 our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized if the actual amount of our future taxable income is less than the amount we are currently projecting with respect to specific tax jurisdictions or if there is a change in the time period within which the deferred tax asset becomes deductible we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets the recording of a valuation allowance would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on our operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances which would have either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate 

 

 significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we provide for uncertain tax positions with respect to tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards mandated by applicable accounting guidance changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties impact our effective tax rate when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

 

 although the company’s board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program and recently increased the amount of its quarterly cash dividends payable on its common stock any determinations by the 

  

company to continue to repurchase its common stock or by the board of directors to continue to pay cash dividends on its common stock will be based primarily upon the company’s financial condition results of operations business requirements price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase program and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of the company’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs 

 

 our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations this effect could be exacerbated if any officers or other key personnel left as a group our success also depends on our continuing ability to attract retain and develop highly qualified personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key employees or attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future

with respect to the remediation notification qgn engaged in discussions with ima during which qgn asserted that a number of the remediation measures including the removal of the landfills and the timeframes for implementation were not appropriate and requested that the remediation notification be withdrawn in response in february 2011 ima issued a revised remediation notification providing for further site analysis by qgn including further study of the integrity of the landfills the revised remediation notice did not include a requirement to remove the landfills qgn has responded to the revised remediation notification providing further information regarding the remediation measures and intends to continue discussions with the institute of environment and waste management “inema” successor to ima to seek agreement on an appropriate remediation plan in mid 2011 qgn consistent with the revised remediation notice began an additional site investigation capped the two active landfills with an impervious synthetic cover and initiated the closure of the pond however discussions are continuing with inema concerning the potential removal of the landfills

antitrust matters 

in june 2009 the company received a subpoena and civil investigative demand from the federal trade commission “ftc” in connection with a nonpublic investigation in which the ftc is seeking to determine if the company has engaged or is engaging in any unfair methods of competition with respect to the distribution and sale of condoms in the united states through potentially exclusionary practices the company believes that its distribution and sales practices involving the sale of condoms are in full compliance with applicable law 

the ftc investigation arose out of allegations raised by mayer laboratories inc “mayer labs” a california based condom business competitor whose principal brand of condoms has a us market share of less than one percent on november 21 2008 following the company’s receipt of correspondence from counsel for mayer labs threatening litigation related to the company’s condom sales and marketing practices the company commenced a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the district of new jersey seeking a ruling that the company’s condom sales and marketing practices are legal the case subsequently was transferred to the united states district court for the northern district of california 

in the litigation mayer labs alleges among other things that the company’s long standing shelf space program under which a retail store chain allocates a percentage of shelf space to the company’s products in exchange for price rebates other sales and marketing practices through which the company allegedly attempted to influence the brand mix and shelf placement of condoms in certain retail stores and other alleged anticompetitive activities violated federal and state antitrust laws and that the company tortiously interfered with an alleged exclusive business arrangement between mayer labs and its supplier mayer labs generally seeks an order declaring the company’s sales and marketing practices related to shelf space allocation for condoms to be illegal monetary damages and trebling of certain of the damages disgorgement of profits injunctive relief and recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs 

on january 6 2012 mayer labs’ served an expert’s report indicating that it is seeking damages of between 26 million and 31 million and trebling of those damages at this point it is not possible to estimate the amount of any additional alleged damage claims mayer labs may make 

on the same date the company filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to mayer labs’ claims which was argued before the court on february 10 2012 if the company’s motion for summary judgment is denied the matter is scheduled to proceed to trial on april 2 2012 

mayer labs filed a motion for sanctions on february 7 2012 against the company which the company believes are unjustified and is vigorously contesting the motion is based on the deletion of emails allegedly relevant to the litigation by james r craigie the company’s chairman and chief executive officer and the claim that the company allegedly failed to make a reasonable and good faith effort to recover certain of the deleted emails although the company believes that it has been able to retrieve substantially all of the deleted emails the sanctions sought by mayer labs include the dismissal of the company’s claims against mayer labs a default judgment against the company with respect to mayer labs’ claims against the company or alternatively an adverse inference that the deleted documents would have supported mayer’s claims an instruction that the company notify parties opposing the company in other previous and pending lawsuits if the company has violated its obligation to preserve documents related to those lawsuits preclusion of the company from introducing any email evidence to or from its chairman and chief executive officer and payment of attorneys fees 

as noted above with respect to the ftc investigation and the mayer labs litigation the company believes that its condom sales and marketing practices are in full compliance with applicable law moreover the company intends to vigorously defend against mayer labs’ allegations however these matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of investigations and litigation matters is not predictable with assurance an adverse outcome in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows moreover an adverse outcome with regard to mayer labs’ motion for sanctions could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the ftc investigation and the mayer labs litigation and might adversely affect the company with regard to other litigation

economic conditions 

as has been the case for the past few years uncertainty about global economic conditions has affected demand for many products specific factors affecting demand include rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors that affect consumer spending behavior while the company’s products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products the company’s products have become subject to increasing price competition as recessionary conditions continue moreover some of our products such as laundry additives and batteryoperated toothbrushes are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of our customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs pet specialty stores and dollar stores have experienced declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all in response we continue to regularly conduct a review of the financial strength of our key customers as appropriate we modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales we also continue to regularly conduct a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations where appropriate we will seek to identify alternate sources of materials and services to date we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers however a continued economic decline that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our operations and sales 

in addition many of our customers sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products that we sell as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending during current 

  

difficult economic times some of our customers have discontinued or reduce distribution of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase our customers’ less expensive private label products to offset any adverse effect on our business that results when customers discontinue or reduce distribution of our products or take actions to increase shelf space for their private label products we focus our efforts on improving distribution with other customers while these efforts have generally been effective our results could be adversely affected if these efforts are not effective

in 2012 the company is changing its 4 week—4 week—5 week quarterly reporting calendar to a monthend quarterly calendar this change is also the result of the upgrade of its information systems this change will eliminate differences in the number of days in the first and fourth quarters of the year when the company provides yearoverprior year period comparisons beginning in 2013 the impact of the change in the quarterly reporting calendar will not be material for 2012

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty they are based on the company’s historical experience its observation of trends in industry information provided by its customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate the company’s significant accounting policies and estimates are described below 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves 

virtually all of the company’s revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered or picked up by our customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company’s products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs 

  

associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements an approximately 21 million difference in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns the company uses experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if the company’s estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 57 million while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations during the twelve months ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 the company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately 82 million 68 million and 78 million respectively based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information these adjustments are immaterial relative to the amount of trade promotion expense incurred annually by the company

carrying values of goodwill trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment  the company’s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trademarks and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired there were no intangible impairment charges for the three year period ended december 31 2011 

property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment  the company’s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the longlived assets are largely independent of other groups of company assets and liabilities the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology the continued success of product lines and future volume revenue and expense growth rates the company conducts annual reviews to identify idle and underutilized equipment and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when an impairment is indicated the estimated 

future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows 

the company recognized charges related to plant impairment and equipment obsolescence which occurs in the ordinary course of business during the three year period ended december 31 2011 as follows 

 

   

the 2011 consumer domestic charge is a result of the idling of equipment the 2011 specialty products charge in 2011 is associated with the company’s decision to explore strategic options for the specialty chemical business in brazil in 2010 the company recorded a plant asset impairment charge of approximately 31 million representing the carrying value of certain assets associated with its brazil subsidiary the charge is a result of a reduction in forecasted sales volume which has negatively impacted projected profitability the charge is included in cost of sales in the specialty products division segment in 2009 the company recorded a plant asset impairment charge of approximately 69 million representing the carrying value of certain assets associated with one of its international subsidiaries the company measured the impairment charges using the discounted cash flow method this subsidiary manufactures some products that compete with imports priced in us dollars as the dollar has weakened it has been necessary to lower prices in the local currency to stay competitive leading to negative cash flows which is the key input under the discounted cash flow method the charge is included in cost of sales in the specialty products division segment the other charges in 2010 are due to the idling of certain equipment the 32 million charge recorded in the consumer domestic segment in 2009 is primarily a result of a lack of acceptance of certain products by our key customers that resulted in a decline of forecasted future cash flows and reduced profitability the estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations nevertheless future outcomes may differ materially from management’s estimates if the company’s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized then the company’s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 

inventory valuation 

when appropriate the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value which reflects any costs to sell or dispose the company identifies any slow moving obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is required to establish a new carrying value the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company’s products technological changes and new product introductions in addition the company’s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units “skus” the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were 47 million at december 31 2011 and 61 million at december 31 2010 

valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs 

the company’s pension costs relate solely to its international operations both pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in benefit cost valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s international pension and domesticinternational postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets 

the discount rate is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the company’s pension plans and postretirement plans the company refers to an applicable index and expected term of benefit payments to select a discount rate at which it believes the pension benefits could be effectively settled the company’s weighted average discount rate for its international pension plans as of december 31 2011 is 473 as compared to 532 used at december 31 2010 based on the published rate as of december 31 2011 that matched estimated cash flows for the plans the company used a discount rate of 425 for its domestic postretirement plan as compared to 520 used at december 31 2010 

the expected longterm rate of return on international pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans the asset mix of the plans and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation based on these factors the 

  

company’s weighted average expected longterm rate of return for assets of its pension plans for 2011 was 587 compared to 576 used in 2010 a 50 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return would result in approximately 03 million change in pension expense for 2012 

as noted above changes in assumptions used by management may result in material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs in 2011 other comprehensive income reflected a 77 million increase in its remaining pension plan obligations and a 23 million increase for postretirement benefit plans the changes are primarily related to the change in discount rates for all plans 

the company made cash contributions of approximately 48 million to its pension plans in 2011 the company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately 36 million in 2012 to offset 2012 benefit payments and administrative costs in excess of investment returns 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized the liabilities relate to tax return positions that although supportable by the company may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement the company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change in this regard settlement of any issue or an adverse determination in litigation with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate conversely favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate

net sales 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 were 27493 million 1601 million or approximately 62 above 2010 net sales the components of the net sales increase are the following 

 

  

  the volume change reflects increased sales of consumer products sold in the consumer domestic and consumer international segments specialty product segment “spd” volumes were unchanged pricing had minimal impact on total net sales as favorable pricing for spd was offset by the unfavorable pricing for consumer domestic and consumer international sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 benefited from a timing shift in customer buying patterns from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 in advance of the january 1 2012 information system implementation in the united states the impact on income before income taxes on these sales was not material the discontinued product line reflects the company’s decision in late 2010 to cease a foreign subsidiary’s sale of a certain chemical product line the impact of the discontinued product line on income before income taxes was not material other components of the net sales increase reflect the company’s change in delivery arrangements with certain customers at the beginning of the second quarter of 2010 which resulted in a reduction in net sales due to a transportation allowance for a customer pickup program previously the cost to ship product was included in cost of sales 

operating costs 

the company’s gross profit was 12145 million in 2011 a 567 million increase as compared to 2010 the gross profit increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes contributions from the acquired 

  

product lines slightly favorable pricing the effect of cost reduction programs and favorable foreign exchange rates partially offset by higher commodity costs and 3 million of charges associated with the decision to explore strategic alternatives for the chemical business in brazil price increases for detergent and condoms mitigated a portion of the significant increases in the cost of resins surfactants and latex the 2010 gross profit includes charges for environmental remediation asset impairment and plant shutdown costs of 76 million at the company’s brazil subsidiary gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 442 as compared to 447 in 2010 this decrease is principally due to higher commodity costs an unfavorable product mix and higher trade promotion spending partially offset by manufacturing cost reduction projects 

marketing expense for 2011 was 3541 million an increase of 161 million as compared to 2010 marketing spending primarily was in support of the company’s eight power brands as well as expenses of the recently acquired product lines batiste and feline pine and the effect of exchange rates marketing expenses as a percentage of sales was 129 in 2011 as compared to 131 in 2010 this reduction is due to a shift toward higher trade promotion spending which is included in net sales 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” were 3678 million in 2011 a decrease of 70 million as compared to 2010 sga in 2010 included a 24 million charge related to the transfer and settlement of the company’s us pension plan obligations several components of the company’s sga were higher in 2011 than in 2010 including higher legal expenses in 2011 related in part to the company’s response to an ftc subpoena and defense of a related lawsuit higher research and development expenses transition and amortization expense related to the product lines acquired in 2010 and 2011 and the effect of foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs and a gain on the sale of certain lambert kay product lines in 2010 

other income and expenses 

in 2011 equity in earnings of affiliates was 100 million as compared to 50 million in 2010 the increase is due to higher equity income from the company’s armand products company joint venture primarily as a result of lower costs of a key raw material 

other expense was approximately 12 million in 2011 as compared to other expense of 46 million in 2010 which reflects the 2010 writeoff of approximately 45 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the company’s prepayment of variable and subordinated debt see the “liquidity and capital resources” below in this management’s discussion and analysis for further information 

interest expense for 2011 decreased 191 million compared to 2010 the decline was due to lower average debt outstanding as a result of the company’s repayment of debt at the end of 2010 refinancing of its bond debt and the reversal of interest accruals following the settlement of a state tax audit the 2010 amount includes a 30 million reversal of interest accruals associated with certain tax reserves following the settlement of an internal revenue service “irs” audit and the lapse of applicable statues of limitations which was offset by a 43 million charge associated with the termination of the company’s interest rate collar and interest swap agreements 

investment earnings of 19 million were higher than in 2010 due to interest received on a federal tax refund and higher investment returns primarily at the company’s international subsidiaries 

taxation 

the 2011 tax rate was 374 as compared to 353 in 2010 the effective tax rate for 2011 included a charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance of approximately 13 million against the deferred tax assets of the company’s brazilian subsidiary offset by a deferred income tax benefit of approximately 6 million relating to new jersey’s corporate tax reform legislation enacted in april 2011 the effective tax rate

marketing expenses for 2010 were 3380 million a decrease of 157 million or 44 as compared to 2009 marketing spending primarily was in support of the company’s eight power brands funds from the reduction in marketing expenses were primarily used to increase trade promotion expenses reflected in net sales due to competitive pricing activity

competition for consumer domestic and consumer international 

the company competes in the oral care personal care and deodorizing markets using the strengths of its trademarks and technologies these are highly innovative markets characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and requiring heavy advertising and promotion 

  

the domestic condom market is highly concentrated in product offerings with a limited number of competitors the market is divided between premium brands and price brands with companies competing on the basis of quality innovation and price 

the domestic depilatories and waxes market is highly concentrated with a limited number of competitors products compete based on their functionality innovation and price 

consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced such as laundry and household cleaning products are subject to significant price competition as a result the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share 

internationally the company’s products compete in similar competitive categories 

many of the company’s competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company sun products corporation the clorox company colgatepalmolive company sc johnson  son inc henkel ag  co kgaa reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson and inverness medical innovations inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than the company and have the capacity to outspend the company if they attempt to gain market share 

product introductions typically involve heavy marketing costs in the year of launch and the company usually is not able to determine whether the new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product line 

because of the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from customers particularly the highvolume retail store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms these concessions or terms could reduce the company’s margins furthermore if the company is unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to its trade customers the customers could increase product purchases from competitors and reduce purchases from the company which would harm the company’s sales and profitability

the company’s operations are subject to federal state and local regulations governing air emissions wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities the company endeavors to take actions necessary to comply with such regulations these steps include periodic environmental audits of each company facility the audits conducted by independent engineering firms with expertise in environmental compliance include site visits at each location as well as a review of documentary information to determine compliance with such federal state and local regulations other than the item noted below the company believes that it is in compliance with existing environmental regulations 

in 2000 the company acquired majority ownership in its brazilian subsidiary quimica geral do nordeste sa “qgn” the acquired operations included an inorganic salt manufacturing plant which began site operations in the late 1970’s located on the site were two closed landfills two active landfills and a pond for the management of the process waste streams in 2009 qgn was advised by environmental authorities in the state of bahia the institute of the environment “ima” that the plant was discharging contaminants into an adjacent creek after learning of the discharge qgn took immediate action to cease the discharge and retained two nationally recognized environmental firms to prepare a site investigation  remedial action plan “sira” the sira report was submitted by qgn to ima in april 2010 the report concluded that the likely sources of the discharge were the failure of the pond and closed landfills 

in november 2010 ima responded to qgn’s recommendation for an additional study by issuing a notification requiring a broad range of remediation measures the “remediation notification” in addition notwithstanding repeated discussions with ima at qgn’s request to consider qgn’s proposed remediation alternatives in december 2010 ima imposed a fine of five million reals approximately 3 million for the discharge of contaminants above allowable limits qgn filed with ima an administrative defense to the fine ima has not yet responded to qgn’s administrative defense 

with respect to the remediation notification qgn engaged in discussions with ima during which qgn asserted that a number of the remediation measures and the timeframes for implementation were not appropriate and requested that the remediation notification be withdrawn in response ima stayed the remediation notification pending its further review qgn intends to continue discussions with ima to seek agreement on a rational and appropriate remediation plan 

  

  

as a result of the foregoing events the company accrued approximately 3 million in 2009 and an additional 48 million in 2010 for remediation fines and related costs however the company cannot assure that additional costs will not be incurred in connection with this matter

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risks and uncertainties as well as others described elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

 uncertainty about current global economic conditions has affected demand for many products factors that can affect demand include rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior while the company’s products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products they may become subject to increasing price competition as recessionary conditions continue moreover some of our products such as laundry additives and batteryoperated toothbrushes are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of our customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs pet specialty stores and dollar stores have experienced declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all in response we regularly conduct a review of the financial strength of our key customers as appropriate we modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales we also regularly conduct a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations where appropriate we intend to identify alternate sources of materials and services to date we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers however a continued economic decline that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our operations and sales 

the banking system and financial markets have experienced severe disruption including among other things bank failures and consolidations severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades declines in asset valuations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these conditions present the following risks to us among others 

 

  

 we have not been notified of any circumstances that would prevent any participating financial institution from funding our revolving credit agreement or term loan accordion feature or from participating in our securitization facility on february 14 2012 however under current or future circumstances such constraints may exist although we believe that our operating cash flows together with our access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity the inability of one or more institutions to fund the credit facilities or participate in our securitization facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

  

 the economic crisis caused many of our trade customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell which may result in their reduction or discontinuance of certain of our product lines particularly those products that are not number one or two in their category if this occurs and we are unable to improve distribution for those products at other trade customers our company’s results could be adversely affected 

in addition many of our trade customers sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products that we sell as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending during these difficult economic times our trade customers may discontinue or reduce distribution of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase our trade customers’ less expensive private label products to the extent some of our products are discontinued or are adversely affected by our trade customers’ actions to increase shelf space for their private label products we are focusing our efforts on improving distribution with other customers our results could be adversely affected if our efforts are not effective 

 

 our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands particularly the arm  hammer oxiclean and trojan brands the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further our results could be adversely affected if one of our leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues 

 

 we introduced new consumer product line extensions such as arm  hammer power gel laundry detergent arm  hammer double duty cat litter and trojan fire and ice condoms the development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development and marketing expenditures which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of our existing products our financial performance could be harmed 

 

 from time to time we have discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs we may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand moreover product quality defects or safety concerns could result in product recalls product returns or recalls writeoffs or shutdown costs would reduce sales cash flow and earnings 

 

 during 2010 approximately 79 of our sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning 

  

products toothpastes antiperspirants and deodorants our unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of our products by consumers product innovation and our ability to capture market share from competitors we may not succeed in implementing strategies to increase domestic revenues 

the consumer products industry particularly the laundry detergent personal care and air deodorizer categories is intensely competitive to protect existing market share or to capture increased market share we may need to increase expenditures for promotion and advertising and to introduce and establish new products increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing market share and could result in lower sales and profits many of our competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company sun products corporation the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel ag  co kgaa reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson inverness medical innovations inc and sc johnson  son inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and therefore have the capacity to outspend us should they attempt to gain market share if we lose market share and the markets in which we compete do not grow substantially our sales levels and operating results will decline 

 

 in conjunction with our 2005 acquisition of spinbrush from procter  gamble we received a royalty free license to use the crest tradename until october 29 2009 and procter  gamble agreed to refrain from using the crest tradename on batteryoperated toothbrushes for two years thereafter we completed the transition plan to remove the crest tradename from its spinbrush products prior to termination of the license spinbrush retained its position in 2010 as the number one brand in batteryoperated toothbrushes but we cannot predict the longterm effect that the loss of the tradename or any effort by procter  gamble to market batteryoperated toothbrushes under the crest tradename after october 2011 will have on spinbrush sales and profitability 

 

 consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced like many of our products are subject to significant price competition as a result we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase prices by an amount that does not cover manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices or inability to raise prices sufficiently to cover manufacturing cost increases in response to these pressures would harm profit margins in addition if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins our results of operations would suffer 

because of the competitive environment facing retailers many of our trade customers particularly our highvolume retail store customers have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms our margins are reduced further if we are unable to maintain terms that are acceptable to our trade customers these trade customers could reduce purchases of our products and increase purchases of products from our competitors which would harm our sales and profitability 

 

 from time to time our retail customers have reduced inventory levels in managing their working capital requirements any reduction in inventory levels by our retail customers would result in reduced orders and harm our operating results for the financial periods affected by the reductions in particular continued consolidation within the retail industry could potentially reduce inventory levels maintained by our retail customers which could result in reduced orders and adversely affect our results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions 

  

 our performance also depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and by the financial difficulties of retailers consumer products such as those marketed by us are increasingly being sold by club stores and mass merchandisers while sales of consumer products by food and drug stores comprise a smaller proportion of the total volume of consumer products sold sales of our products are stronger in the food and drug channels of trade and not as strong in club stores and mass merchandiser channels although we have taken steps to improve sales to club stores and mass merchandisers if we are not successful in further improving sales to these channels and the current trend continues our financial condition and operating results could suffer 

 

 walmart together with its affiliates is our largest customer accounting for approximately 23 of net sales in 2010 and 22 in each of the years 2009 and 2008 our top three customers accounted for approximately 33 of net sales in 2010 32 of net sales in 2009 and 31 of net sales in 2008 the loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by walmart and its affiliates or any of our other largest customers would harm our sales and profitability 

 

 as of december 31 2010 we had 3397 million of total consolidated indebtedness our failure to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

 we have made several acquisitions in recent years including businesses previously operated by del pharmaceuticals inc and orange glo international inc the simply saline nasal moisturizer product line and the feline pine natural cat litter product line we may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future any future acquisitions or investments would entail various risks including the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of our ongoing business and generally our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent we acquire businesses that have operations or sources of supply outside of the united states and canada for which products are manufactured locally by third parties these factors could harm our financial condition and operating results any future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the issuance of new equity by us or the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and divert other resources from other matters that are critical to our operations 

 

 our distribution of condoms under the trojan and other trademarks is regulated by the us food and drug administration “fda” certain of our condoms and similar condoms sold by our competitors contain the spermicide nonoxynol9 “n9” some interested groups have issued reports that n9 should not be used rectally or for multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse in late 2008 the fda issued final labeling guidance for 

  

latex condoms but excluded n9 lubricated condoms from the guidance while we await further fda guidance on n9 lubricated condoms we believe that our present labeling for condoms with n9 is compliant with the overall objectives of the fda’s guidance and that condoms with n9 will remain a viable contraceptive choice for those couples who wish to use them however we cannot predict the nature of the labeling that ultimately will be required by the fda if the fda or state governments eventually promulgate rules that prohibit or restrict the use of n9 in condoms such as new labeling requirements we could incur costs from obsolete products packaging or raw materials and sales of condoms could decline which in turn could decrease our earnings 

 

 operations at our manufacturing facilities may be subject to disruption from a variety of causes including work stoppages acts of war terrorism pandemics fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

 increases in the prices of raw materials such as surfactants which are cleaning agents palm oil paper products and bottles or increases in energy costs could significantly affect our profit margins in particular during the past few years we have experienced extraordinary price increases for raw and packaging materials diesel fuel and energy concerns about the adequacy of oil supply in the face of increasing demand continued to affect pricing we use surfactants and bottles in the manufacture and marketing of laundry and household cleaning products we use paper products for packaging in many of our consumer and specialty chemical products we use palm oil in certain of our animal nutrition products we have attempted to address these price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of our own products entering into prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and entering into hedge agreements for diesel fuel costs if raw material price increases continue to occur we may not be able to fully offset those price increases this could harm our financial condition and operating results 

we use hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices and related fuel surcharges the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to our product costs enabling us to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in diesel fuel prices over the term of the contract however in periods of declining fuel prices the hedge agreements can have the effect of increasing our expenditures for fuel 

 

 the manufacturing processing formulation packaging labeling and advertising of our products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the federal trade commission “ftc” and the consumer product safety commission in addition our operations are subject to the oversight of the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold 

in particular the fda regulates the safety manufacturing labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits and overthecounter pharmaceuticals the fda also exercises oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of our other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda 

  

may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that we use to manufacture regulated products and may observe compliance issues that would require us to make certain changes in our manufacturing facilities and processes we may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until a compliance issue has been remediated as a result our business could be adversely affected 

our international operations including the production of overthecounter drug products are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which we manufacture or market goods changes in product standards or manufacturing requirements in any of these jurisdictions could require us to make certain modifications to our operations or product formulations or to cease manufacturing certain products completely the effect of the regulatory environment in foreign countries on our overthecounter and medical devices may affect our ability to market and to make competitive claims for our products as a result our international business could be adversely affected 

 

 our international operations subject us to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in all foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the united states and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flow into us dollars outside the united states sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the euro british pound brazilian real canadian dollar mexican peso chinese yuan and australian dollar a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow 

 

 we must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

 we may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by our products claims could be based on allegations that among other things our products contain contaminants provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances product 

  

liability claims also could result in negative publicity that could harm our sales and operating results in addition if one of our products is found to be defective we could be required to recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

 we rely on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or if necessary successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

 we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to interact with internal personnel and external customers and suppliers and other persons these interactions include but are not limited to ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements and other processes necessary to manage our business our systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages and security breaches although we have business continuity plans in place to address service interruptions if our business continuity plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely affect our business in addition we are transitioning our ordering shipping and billing systems in north america and western europe to a new system during 2011 and 2012 if the new system does not function properly upon implementation our ability to process and deliver customer orders in regions in which we conduct the substantial majority of our business could be limited which could adversely impact our results of operations during the periods of transition in addition we may be unable to process and receive payments for products sold which could negatively impact our cash flows during those periods 

 

 our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized if the actual amount of our future taxable income is less than the amount we are currently projecting with respect to specific tax jurisdictions or if there is a change in the time period within which the deferred tax asset becomes deductible we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets the recording of a valuation allowance would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on our operating results in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances which would have either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate 

  

 significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we provide for uncertain tax positions with respect to tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards mandated by applicable accounting guidance changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties impact our effective tax rate when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution

recent developments 

on june 4 2010 the company acquired the simply saline brand of nasal saline moisturizers from blairex laboratories “simply saline acquisition” for cash consideration of 700 million this brand will complement the company’s existing sterimar brand nasal saline solution business in europe and other parts of the world the simply saline brand will be managed principally within the consumer domestic segment 

on december 21 2010 the company acquired the feline pine cat litter brand from nature’s earth products inc “feline pine acquisition” for a cash consideration of 460 million this brand will complement the existing arm  hammer cat litter business and position the company as the leading supplier of natural cat litter the feline pine brand will be managed within the consumer domestic segment 

in the first quarter of 2010 the company sold the brillo and certain lambert kay product lines along with associated productive assets that were classified as net assets held for sale at december 31 2009 the aggregate carrying value of these assets at december 31 2009 was approximately 88 million subsequent to december 31 2009 the company received net proceeds from the sale of these assets of 82 million along with a note receivable of 18 million and in the first quarter of 2010 recognized a gain of approximately 10 million that was recorded as an offset to selling general and administrative expenses in the consumer domestic segment 

on january 27 2010 the company’s board of directors approved the termination effective april 15 2010 of the church  dwight co inc retirement plan for hourly employees the “us pension plan” under which approximately 766 participants including 46 active employees have accrued benefits on december 1 2010 the company as plan sponsor of us pension plan purchased a non participating group annuity contract 

  

from the principal life insurance company for the benefit of certain former and current employees with vested benefits in and retired participants currently receiving benefits from the us pension plan in addition effective december 1 2010 an existing participating annuity contract with aetna insurance company was changed to a nonparticipating annuity contract 

the purchase price of the contracts was approximately 63 million which was funded from the assets of the us pension plan on december 1 2010 considered the measurement date for accounting purposes and a onetime payment by the company of approximately 14 million 9 million after taxes the transactions resulted in the transfer and settlement of the us pension benefit obligation thus relieving the company of any responsibility for the us pension plan obligations as a result of the transfer of the pension plan obligations and assets described above the company recorded a charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 of approximately 24 million pretax or 021 per share this charge is included in selling general and administrative costs “sga” 

following a raw material price decline in 2009 prices for commodities generally increased in 2010 as a result the cost of surfactants diesel fuel corrugated paper and oilbased raw and packaging materials used in the household and specialty products businesses were all higher at the end of 2010 than the 2009 average moreover the price of palm fatty acid distillate pfad which generally fluctuates with the price of global vegetable oil and latex were at record levels by the end of 2010 additional increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact the company’s costs and financial results if the company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers 

the company has recorded liabilities in connection with uncertain income tax positions that although supportable may be challenged by the tax authorities substantially all material federal state and international income tax matters have been effectively concluded for years through 2007 in 2010 the company recognized a benefit from the reversal of approximately 40 million in income tax expense and 30 million in pretax interest expense associated with certain tax liabilities as a result of the settlement of an irs audit and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitation of several state taxing authorities in addition as a result of the settlement of the irs audit and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitation of several state taxing authorities the company’s liabilities for uncertain income tax positions have decreased by 150 million from 396 million at december 31 2009 to 246 million at december 31 2010 

in 2000 the company acquired majority ownership in its brazilian subsidiary quimica geral do nordeste sa “qgn” the acquired operations included an inorganic salt manufacturing plant which began site operations in the late 1970’s located on the site were two closed landfills two active landfills and a pond for the management of the process waste streams in 2009 qgn was advised by environmental authorities in the state of bahia the institute of the environment “ima” that the plant was discharging contaminants into an adjacent creek after learning of the discharge qgn took immediate action to cease the discharge and retained two nationally recognized environmental firms to prepare a site investigation  remedial action plan “sira” the sira report was submitted by qgn to ima in april 2010 the report concluded that the likely sources of the discharge were the failure of the pond and closed landfills 

in november 2010 ima responded to qgn’s recommendation for an additional study by issuing a notification requiring a broad range of remediation measures the “remediation notification” in addition notwithstanding repeated discussions with ima at qgn’s request to consider qgn’s proposed remediation alternatives in december 2010 ima imposed a fine of five million reals approximately 3 million for the discharge of contaminants above allowable limits qgn filed with ima an administrative defense to the fine ima has not yet responded to qgn’s administrative defense 

with respect to the remediation notification qgn engaged in discussions with ima during which qgn asserted that a number of the remediation measures and the timeframes for implementation were not appropriate 

  

and requested that the remediation notification be withdrawn in response ima stayed the remediation notification pending its further review qgn intends to continue discussions with ima to seek agreement on a rational and appropriate remediation plan 

as a result of the foregoing events the company accrued approximately 3 million in 2009 and an additional 48 million in 2010 for remediation fines and related costs however the company cannot assure that additional costs will not be incurred in connection with this matter 

economic conditions 

uncertainty about current global economic conditions has affected demand for many products factors that can affect demand include rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors that affect consumer spending behavior while the company’s products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products the company’s products may become subject to increasing price competition as recessionary conditions continue moreover some of our products such as laundry additives and batteryoperated toothbrushes are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of our customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs pet specialty stores and dollar stores have experienced declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all in response we regularly conduct a review of the financial strength of our key customers as appropriate we modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales we also regularly conduct a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations where appropriate we will seek to identify alternate sources of materials and services to date we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers however a continued economic decline that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our operations and sales 

in addition many of our trade customers sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products that we sell as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending during current difficult economic times our trade customers may discontinue or reduce distribution of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase our trade customers’ less expensive private label products to offset any adverse effect on our business that results when trade customers discontinue distribution of our products or take actions to increase shelf space for their private label products we focus our efforts on improving distribution with other customers our results could be adversely affected if these efforts are not effective 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty they are based on the company’s historical experience its observation of trends in industry information provided by its customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate the company’s significant accounting policies and estimates are described below 

  

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves 

virtually all of the company’s revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered or picked up by our customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company’s products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements an approximately 24 million difference in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns the company uses experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if the company’s estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 54 million while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations during the twelve months ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately 68 million 78 million and 40 million respectively based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information 

impairment of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets and property plant and equipment 

carrying values of goodwill trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment  the company’s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trademarks and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 

the company recognized tradename impairment charges within selling general and administrative expenses for the three year period ended december 31 2010 as follows 

 

 the tradename impairment charges recorded in 2008 were a result of management’s decision to exit a business a potential change of a brand’s name lost distribution at key customer accounts and reduced profitability the amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the 

  

asset to its carrying amount fair value was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” discounted cash flow method under this method the owner of an intangible asset must determine the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license that asset from a third party estimates under the relief from royalty method involve numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change and therefore could affect fair values in the future the company determined that the remaining carrying value of all tradenames was recoverable based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability of the brands 

property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment  the company’s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the longlived assets are largely independent of other groups of company assets and liabilities the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology the continued success of product lines and future volume revenue and expense growth rates the company conducts annual reviews to identify idle and underutilized equipment and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when an impairment is indicated the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows 

the company recognized charges related to plant impairment and equipment obsolescence which occurs in the ordinary course of business during the three year period ended december 31 2010 as follows 

 

 in 2010 the company recorded a plant asset impairment charge of approximately 31 million representing the carrying value of certain assets associated with one of its international subsidiaries the charge is a result of a reduction in forecasted sales volume which has negatively impacted projected profitability the charge is included in cost of sales in the specialty products division segment income statement in 2009 the company recorded a plant asset impairment charge of approximately 69 million representing the carrying value of certain assets associated with one of its international subsidiaries the company measured the impairment charges using the discounted cash flow method this subsidiary manufactures some products that compete with imports priced in us dollars as the dollar has weakened it has been necessary to lower prices in the local currency to stay competitive leading to negative cash flows which is the key input under the discounted cash flow method the charge is included in cost of sales in the specialty products division segment the other charges in 2010 are due to the idling of certain equipment the 32 million charge recorded in the consumer domestic segment in 2009 is primarily a result of a lack of acceptance for certain products by our key customers that resulted in a decline of forecasted future cash flows and reduced profitability the charges in 2008 are due to the idling of certain equipment the estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations nevertheless future outcomes may differ materially from management’s estimates if the company’s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized then the company’s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 

inventory valuation 

when appropriate the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value which reflects any costs to sell or dispose the company identifies any slow moving obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is needed the determination of 

  

whether inventory items are slow moving obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company’s products technological changes and new product introductions in addition the company’s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units “skus” the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were 61 million at december 31 2010 and 88 million at december 31 2009 

valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs 

as noted above under “overview – recent developments” the company entered into transactions with insurance companies in 2010 that have resulted in the transfer and settlement of all of the company’s us pension benefit obligation the company continues to have us obligations with respect to nonpension postretirement benefits 

the company’s remaining pension costs relate solely to its international operations both pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in benefit cost valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s international pension and domesticinternational postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets 

the discount rate is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the company’s pension plans and postretirement plans the company refers to an applicable index and expected term of benefit payments to select a discount rate at which it believes the pension benefits could be effectively settled the company’s weighted average discount rate for its remaining international pension plans as of december 31 2010 is 532 as compared to 576 used at december 31 2009 based on the published rate as of december 31 2010 that matched estimated cash flows for the plans the company used a discount rate of 520 for its domestic postretirement plan as compared to 575 used at december 31 2009 

the expected longterm rate of return on international pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans the asset mix of the plans and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation based on these factors the company’s weighted average expected longterm rate of return for assets of its remaining pension plans for 2010 was 576 compared to 672 used in 2009 a 50 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return would result in approximately 03 million change in pension expense for 2011 

as noted above changes in assumptions used by management may result in material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs in 2010 other comprehensive income reflected a 34 million increase in its remaining pension plan obligations and a 13 million increase for postretirement benefit plans the changes are primarily related to the change in discount rates for all plans 

the company made cash contributions of approximately 191 million to its pension plans in 2010 which includes approximately 140 million to settle the us pension plan the company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its international pension plans of approximately 35 million in 2011 to offset 2011 benefit payments and administrative costs in excess of investment returns 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled management 

  

provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized the liabilities relate to tax return positions that although supportable by the company may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement the company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change in this regard settlement of any issue or an adverse determination in litigation with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate conversely favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate of income before income taxes

there are no accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted by the company which are expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows accounting pronouncements adopted during the periods presented resulted in changes to disclosures but did not have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows

consolidated results 

2010 compared to 2009 

net sales 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 25892 million 683 million or approximately 27 above 2009 net sales the components of the net sales increase are the following 

 

  

    

the reductions resulting from pricing and sales mix primarily reflect higher trade promotion and slotting costs in support of new product launches at the beginning of the second quarter of 2010 the company changed delivery arrangements with certain customers which resulted in a reduction in net sales due to a transportation allowance for a customer pickup program previously the cost to ship product was included in cost of sales 

operating costs 

the company’s gross profit was 11578 million in 2010 a 568 million increase as compared to 2009 the gross profit increase was attributable to higher sales volumes and lower manufacturing conversion costs partially as a result of cost efficiencies derived from the company’s new manufacturing facility in york pennsylvania a reduction in costs associated with the shutdown of the company’s manufacturing and warehouse facility in north brunswick new jersey in 2009 a contribution from the simply saline business which was acquired late in the second quarter of 2010 and favorable foreign exchange rates partially offsetting the gross profit improvement were higher trade promotion and slotting costs higher commodity costs the net effect of the divested and acquired product lines and the change in customer delivery arrangements the 2010 gross profit includes charges for environmental remediation asset impairment and plant shutdown of 76 million at a company’s international subsidiary the gross profit in 2009 reflected an asset impairment charge and an environmental remediation charge of approximately 60 million also at the company’s international subsidiary gross margin increased 100 basis points to 447 as compared to 437 in 2009 this increase is principally due to the reduction in costs related to the north brunswick plant shutdown manufacturing efficiencies in the new plant in york pennsylvania and the change in customer delivery arrangements partially offset by higher trade spending and commodity costs 

marketing expenses for 2010 were 3380 million a decrease of 157 million or 44 as compared to 2009 marketing spending primarily was in support of the company’s eight power brands funds from the reduction in marketing expenses were primarily used to increase trade promotion expenses reflected in net sales due to competitive pricing activity 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” were 3748 million in 2010 an increase of 203 million as compared to 2009 the increase in sga in 2010 includes the approximate 240 million expense related to the transfer and settlement of the us pension plan obligations the increase also is attributable to the effect of foreign exchange rates higher selling costs in support of higher sales costs associated with a global information system upgrade project and higher legal expenses partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs and the 10 million gain on the sale of certain lambert kay product lines during the first quarter of 2010 

the consolidated statement of income for 2009 reflects the 200 million pretax gain net of legal expenses recognized by the company in connection with the settlement of its litigation against abbott laboratories inc see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information 

other income and expenses 

in 2010 equity in earnings of affiliates was 50 million as compared to 121 million in 2009 the decrease is due to lower equity income from the company’s armand products company joint venture due to lower pricing resulting from increased competitive activity and higher raw material costs 

other expense was approximately 46 million in 2010 as compared to other income of 15 million in 2009 which is primarily attributable to the writeoff of approximately 45 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the company’s prepayment of variable and subordinated debt see the liquidity section in management’s discussion and analysis for further information 

interest expense for 2010 decreased 78 million compared to 2009 the decline was due to the reversal of interest accruals of approximately 30 million associated with certain tax reserves following the settlement of an 

  

irs audit and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations lower interest rates compared to the prior year and lower average debt outstanding partially offset by a charge of 46 million relating to the termination of the company’s interest rate collar and interest rate swap agreements this termination was due to the company’s repayment of its variable rate debt in the fourth quarter of 2010 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information 

investment earnings of 06 million were lower due to a significant decline in interest rates 

taxation 

the 2010 tax rate was 353 as compared to 379 in 2009 the effective tax rate for 2010 included a benefit from an increase in the us manufacturing tax deduction and the reversal of approximately 41 million associated with certain tax liabilities following the settlement of an irs audit and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations

cash flow analysis 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities —the company’s net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 increased 276 million to 4285 million as compared to 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher net income higher deferred income taxes primarily due to tax amortization of intangibles and depreciation and a decrease in working capital exclusive of cash 

for the year ended december 31 2010 the components of working capital that significantly affected operating cash flow are as follows 

accounts receivable increased 127 million due to the timing of increased net sales 

inventories decreased 241 million primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts 

accounts payable and other accrued expenses increased 227 million primarily because of timing of invoice payments offset by higher incentive and profit sharing compensation paid out in early 2010 and severance related payments associated with the closure of the company’s north brunswick new jersey facility in 2009 

income taxes payable decreased 76 million due to the timing of payments

certain financial covenants 

“consolidated ebitda” referred to below as “adjusted ebitda” is a component of the financial covenants contained in and is defined in the new credit agreement financial covenants include a leverage ratio total debt to adjusted ebitda and an interest coverage ratio adjusted ebitda to total interest expense which if not met could result in an event of default and trigger the early termination of the credit agreement adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the leverage ratio during the twelve months ended december 31 2010 was 064 which is below the maximum of 325 permitted under the credit agreement and the interest coverage ratio for the twelve months ending december 31 2010 was 1870 which is above the minimum of 300 permitted under the credit agreement see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for disclosures relating to the credit agreement

equity derivatives 

the company has entered into equity derivative contracts covering its own stock in order to minimize its liability resulting from changes in quoted fair values of company stock to participants under its executive deferred compensation plan who have investments under that plan in a notional company stock fund since the equity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting the company is required to mark the agreements to market throughout the life of the agreements and record changes in fair value in the consolidated statement of income

competition for consumer domestic and consumer international 

the company competes in the oral care personal care and deodorizing markets using the strengths of its trademarks and technologies these are highly innovative markets characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and requiring heavy advertising and promotion 

the domestic condom market is highly concentrated in product offerings with a limited number of competitors the market is divided between premium brands and price brands with companies competing on the basis of quality innovation and price 

the domestic depilatories and waxes market is highly concentrated with a limited number of competitors products compete based on their functionality innovation and price 

internationally the company’s products compete in similar competitive categories 

many of the company’s competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company sun products corporation the clorox company colgatepalmolive company sc johnson  son inc henkel ag  co kgaa reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson inverness medical innovations inc and ssl international plc many of these companies have greater financial resources than the company and have the capacity to outspend the company if they attempt to gain market share 

consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced such as laundry and household cleaning products are subject to significant price competition from time to time the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share 

product introductions typically involve heavy marketing costs in the year of launch and the company usually is not able to determine whether the new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product line 

  

because of the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from customers particularly the highvolume retail store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms these concessions or terms could reduce the company’s margins furthermore if the company is unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to its trade customers the customers could increase product purchases from competitors and reduce purchases from the company which would harm the company’s sales and profitability

continuing a trend that began in 2005 the cost of raw materials in 2009 began at historical highs although by the end of 2009 the cost of many of these raw materials retreated from these highs as a result the cost of surfactants diesel fuel corrugated paper and oilbased raw and packaging materials used in the household and specialty products businesses were all lower at the end of 2009 than the 2008 average moreover the price of palm fatty acid distillate pfad which generally fluctuates with the price of global vegetable oil was on average at the same level as 2008 but had fallen by the end of 2009 the company also benefitted in 2009 from savings realized in cost improvement programs despite a second half reduction in the cost of most commodities some commodities continued to rise in price additional increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact the company’s costs and financial results if the company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risks and uncertainties as well as others described elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

 uncertainty about current global economic conditions has affected demand for many products factors that can affect demand include rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs fuel and other energy 

  

costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior while the company’s products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products they may become subject to increasing price competition as recessionary conditions continue moreover some of our products such as laundry additives and batteryoperated toothbrushes are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of our customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs pet specialty stores and dollar stores have experienced declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all in response we regularly conduct a review of the financial strength of our key customers as appropriate we modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales we also regularly conduct a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations where appropriate we intend to identify alternate sources of materials and services to date we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers however a continued economic decline that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our operations and sales 

the banking system and financial markets have experienced severe disruption including among other things bank failures and consolidations severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades declines in asset valuations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these conditions present the following risks to us among others 

 

  

 we have not been notified of any circumstances that would prevent any participating financial institution from funding our revolving credit agreement or term loan accordion feature or from participating in our securitization facility in february 2011 however under current or future circumstances such constraints may exist although we believe that our operating cash flows together with our access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity the inability of one or more institutions to fund the credit facilities or participate in our securitization facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

 

 the economic crisis has caused many of our trade customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell which may result in their reduction or discontinuance of certain of our product lines particularly those products that are not number one or two in their category if this occurs and we are unable to improve distribution for those products at other trade customers our company’s results could be adversely affected 

  

in addition many of our trade customers sell products under their own private label brands which compete with products that we sell as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending during these difficult economic times our trade customers may discontinue or reduce distribution of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase their less expensive private label products to the extent some of our products are discontinued or are adversely affected by our trade customers’ actions to increase shelf space for their private label products we are focusing our efforts on improving distribution with other customers our results could be adversely affected if our efforts are not effective 

 

 our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands particularly the arm  hammer and trojan brands the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further our results could be adversely affected if one of our leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues 

 

 we introduced new consumer product line extensions such as trojan ecstasy condoms nair exfoliator with microbeads baby orajel cooling cucumber teething gel baby orajel tooth and gum cleanser arm  hammer total 2in1 dryer cloths and oxiclean max force a concentrated stain remover the development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development and marketing expenditures which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of our existing products our financial performance could be harmed 

 

 from time to time we have discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs we may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand moreover product quality defects or safety concerns could result in product recalls product returns or recalls writeoffs or shutdown costs would reduce sales cash flow and earnings 

 

 during 2009 approximately 81 of our sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes antiperspirants and deodorants our unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of our products by consumers product innovation and our ability to capture market share from competitors we may not succeed in implementing strategies to increase domestic revenues 

the consumer products industry particularly the laundry detergent personal care and air deodorizer categories is intensely competitive to protect existing market share or to capture increased market share we 

  

may need to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and to introduce and establish new products increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing market share and could result in lower sales and profits many of our competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company sun products corporation the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel ag  co kgaa ssl international plc reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson inverness medical innovations inc and sc johnson  son inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and therefore have the capacity to outspend us should they attempt to gain market share if we lose market share and the markets in which we compete do not grow our sales levels and operating results will decline 

 

 in conjunction with the 2005 spinbrush acquisition from procter  gamble the company received a royalty free license to use the crest tradename until october 29 2009 and procter  gamble agreed to refrain from using the crest tradename on batteryoperated toothbrushes for two years thereafter we completed the transition plan to remove the crest tradename from its spinbrush products prior to termination of the license spinbrush retained its position in 2009 as the number one brand in batteryoperated toothbrushes but we cannot predict the longterm effect of the loss of the tradename will have on spinbrush sales and profitability 

 

 consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced like many of our products are subject to significant price competition from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase prices by an amount that does not cover manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices or inability to raise prices sufficiently to cover manufacturing cost increases in response to these pressures would harm profit margins in addition if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins our results of operations would suffer 

because of the competitive environment facing retailers many of our trade customers particularly our highvolume retail store customers have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms our margins are reduced further if we are unable to maintain terms that are acceptable to our trade customers these trade customers could reduce purchases of our products and increase purchases of products from our competitors which would harm our sales and profitability 

 

 from time to time our retail customers have reduced inventory levels in managing their working capital requirements any reduction in inventory levels by our retail customers would result in reduced orders and harm our operating results for the financial periods affected by the reductions in particular continued consolidation within the retail industry could potentially reduce inventory levels maintained by our retail customers which could result in reduced orders and adversely affect our results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions 

 

 our performance also depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and by the financial difficulties of 

  

retailers industry wide consumer products such as those marketed by us are increasingly being sold by club stores and mass merchandisers while sales of consumer products by food and drug stores comprise a smaller proportion of the total volume of consumer products sold sales of our products are stronger in the food and drug channels of trade and not as strong in the club stores and mass merchandisers although we have taken steps to improve sales by club stores and mass merchandisers if we are not successful in further improving sales to these channels and the current trend continues our financial condition and operating results could suffer 

 

 walmart including its affiliate sam’s club is our largest customer accounting for approximately 22 of net sales in each of the years 2009 2008 and 2007 our top three consumer domestic customers accounted for approximately 32 of net sales in 2009 31 of net sales in 2008 and 30 of net sales in 2007 the loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by walmart or any of our other top customers would harm our sales and profitability 

 

 as of december 31 2009 we had 8163 million of total consolidated indebtedness this level of indebtedness could i limit our ability to borrow money to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements and other financing needs and ii make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or industry or in the economy in the event of a general increase in interest rates our interest expense would increase because a substantial portion of our indebtedness including all of the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities bears interest at floating rates to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on some of our indebtedness we have entered into hedge agreements covering a notional amount of 250 million as of december 31 2009 our failure to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the terms of our subordinated notes and agreement relating to our principal credit facilities place a limit on the amount of certain cash payments we can make this limitation includes the amount we can pay in dividends on our common stock as long as we are not in default under the subordinated notes or the agreement we do not anticipate that the limitation will have an effect on our ability to pay dividends at the current rate 

 

 we have made several acquisitions in recent years including businesses previously operated by del pharmaceuticals inc and orange glo international inc the spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrush brand a skin care brand in south america and the former consumer products businesses of carterwallace inc and may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future any future acquisitions or investments would entail various risks including the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of our ongoing business and generally our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent we acquire businesses that have operations or sources of supply outside of the united states and canada such as the spinbrush business for which products are manufactured by third party contract manufacturers in china and the skin care brand in south america for which products are manufactured locally by third parties these factors could harm our financial condition and operating results any future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the issuance of new equity by us or the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and divert other resources from other matters that are critical to our operations 

  

 our distribution of condoms under the trojan and other trademarks is regulated by the us food and drug administration “fda” certain of our condoms and similar condoms sold by our competitors contain the spermicide nonoxynol9 “n9” some interested groups have issued reports that n9 should not be used rectally or for multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse in late 2008 the fda issued final labeling guidance for latex condoms but excluded n9 lubricated condoms from the guidance while we await further fda guidance on n9 lubricated condoms we believe that our present labeling for condoms with n9 is compliant with the overall objectives of the fda’s guidance and that condoms with n9 will remain a viable contraceptive choice for those couples who wish to use them however we cannot predict the nature of the labeling that ultimately will be required by the fda if the fda or state governments eventually promulgate rules that prohibit or restrict the use of n9 in condoms such as new labeling requirements we could incur costs from obsolete products packaging or raw materials and sales of condoms could decline which in turn could decrease our earnings 

 

 operations at our manufacturing facilities may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism pandemics fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations 

 

 increases in the prices of raw materials such as surfactants which are cleaning agents palm oil paper products and bottles or increases in energy costs could significantly affect our profit margins in particular during the past few years we have experienced extraordinary price increases for raw and packaging materials diesel fuel and energy costs concerns about the adequacy of oil supply in the face of increasing demand continued to affect pricing we use surfactants and bottles in the manufacture and marketing of laundry and household cleaning products we use paper products for packaging in many of our consumer and specialty chemical products we use palm oil in certain of our animal nutrition products we have attempted to address these price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of our own products entering into prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel costs if raw material price increases continue to occur we may not be able to fully offset those price increases this could harm our financial condition and operating results 

we use hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices and related fuel surcharges the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to our product costs enabling us to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in diesel fuel prices over the term of the contract however in periods of declining fuel prices the hedge agreements can have the effect of increasing our expenditures for fuel 

 

 the manufacturing processing formulation packaging labeling and advertising of our products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the federal trade commission “ftc” and the consumer product safety commission in addition our operations are subject to the oversight of the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold 

  

in particular the fda regulates the safety manufacturing labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits and overthecounter pharmaceuticals the fda also exercises a somewhat less rigorous oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of our other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that we use to manufacture regulated products and may observe compliance issues that would require us to make certain changes in our manufacturing facilities and processes we may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until a compliance issue has been remediated as a result our business could be adversely affected 

our international operations including the production of overthecounter drug products are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which we manufacture or market goods changes in product standards or manufacturing requirements in any of these jurisdictions could require us to make certain modifications to our operations or product formulations or to cease manufacturing certain products completely the effect of the regulatory environment in foreign countries on our overthecounter “otc” and medical devices may affect our ability to market and to make competitive claims for our products as a result our international business could be adversely affected 

 

 our international operations subject us to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in all foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the united states and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flow into us dollars outside the united states sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the euro british pound brazilian real canadian dollar mexican peso chinese yuan and australian dollar a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow 

 

 we must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition during 2009 one of our international facilities discharged chemicals into the environment we currently are developing a formal remediation plan and based on available information we have accrued approximately 3 million for remediation and related costs however we cannot assure that additional costs will not be incurred in connection with this matter 

  

 we may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by its products claims could be based on allegations that among other things our products contain contaminants provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances product liability claims also could result in negative publicity that could harm our sales and operating results in addition if one of our products is found to be defective we could be required to recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy 

 

 we rely on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or if necessary successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

 we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed by thirdparty service providers to interact with internal personnel and external customers and suppliers and other persons these interactions include but are not limited to ordering and managing materials from suppliers converting materials to finished products shipping product to customers processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements and other processes necessary to manage our business our systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes including catastrophic events power outages and security breaches although we have business continuity plans in place to address service interruptions if our business continuity plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely affect our business 

 

 significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions we provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” subtopic 74010 income taxes  changes to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties impact our effective tax rate when particular tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution for additional information refer to the information set forth in note 13—income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements 

overview 

the company develops manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer and specialty products it recognizes revenues and profits from selling its products under a variety of brands to supermarkets drug stores and mass merchandisers that sell the products to consumers the company also sells its products to industrial customers and distributors the company focuses its marketing efforts principally on its eight “power brands” these wellrecognized brand names include arm  hammer used in multiple product categories such as baking soda carpet deodorization and laundry detergent trojan condoms xtra laundry detergent oxiclean prewash laundry additive nair depilatories first response home pregnancy and ovulation test kits orajel oral analgesics and spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrushes the company’s business is divided into three primary segments consumer domestic consumer international and specialty products the consumer domestic segment includes the eight power brands and other household and personal care products such as scrub free kaboom orange glo and brillo cleaning products answer home pregnancy and ovulation test kits arrid antiperspirant closeup and aim toothpastes the consumer international segment primarily sells a variety of personal care products some of which use the same brand names as our domestic product lines in international markets including france the united kingdom canada mexico australia brazil and china the specialty products segment is the largest us producer of sodium bicarbonate which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial institutional medical and food applications this segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products in 2009 the consumer domestic consumer international and specialty products segments represented approximately 74 16 and 10 respectively of the company’s net sales 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 the company completed construction of its integrated laundry detergent manufacturing plant and distribution center in york pennsylvania in conjunction with the opening of the new facility the company closed its existing laundry detergent manufacturing plant and distribution facility in north brunswick new jersey the north brunswick facility was comprised of five separate buildings which had resulted in significant inefficiencies and could not accommodate expansion to address expected future growth 

in september 2009 the company and abbott laboratories inc “abbott” agreed to settle patent infringement litigation as part of the settlement abbott paid 27 million to the company the company recognized a pretax gain net of legal expenses of 200 million as of september 2009 which is reflected in the results of the consumer domestic segment 

in june 2009 the company sold certain noncore personal care product lines acquired in the orajel acquisition for approximately 30 million net of fees which approximated book value the results of these product lines were included in both the consumer domestic and consumer international segments during the period from july 2008 until the completion of the sale in june 2009 

continuing a trend that began in 2005 the cost of raw materials in 2009 began at historical highs although by the end of 2009 the cost of many of these raw materials retreated from these highs as a result the cost of surfactants diesel fuel corrugated paper and oilbased raw and packaging materials used in the household and specialty products businesses were all lower at the end of 2009 than the 2008 average moreover the price of palm fatty acid distillate pfad which generally fluctuates with the price of global vegetable oil was on average at the same level as 2008 but had fallen by the end of 2009 the company also benefitted in 2009 from savings realized in cost improvement programs despite a second half reduction in the cost of most commodities some commodities continued to rise in price such as soda ash additional increases in the prices of certain raw materials could further materially impact the company’s costs and financial results if the company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers 

  

the company operates in highly competitive consumer product markets in which cost efficiency new product offerings and innovation are critical to success the consumer products markets are particularly mature in north america and are characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to the company’s most significant product categories such as laundry detergents and oral care furthermore because of ongoing retail sector consolidation and the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from these customers particularly the highvolume retail store customers which increasingly have sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to protect its existing market share or to capture additional market share the company increased expenditures for promotions and advertising and introduced new products and line extensions in order to fund the additional marketing expenses the company has and continues to pursue ongoing cost cutting initiatives as a result of its acquisitions and cost improvement initiatives the company has been able to lower its overall unit costs and increase the productivity of its various manufacturing facilities 

uncertainty about current global economic conditions has affected demand for many products factors that can affect demand include rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior while the company’s products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products they may become subject to increasing price competition as recessionary conditions continue moreover some of our products such as laundry additives and batteryoperated toothbrushes are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of our customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs pet specialty stores and dollar stores have experienced declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all in response we regularly conduct a review of the financial strength of our key customers as appropriate we modify customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales we also regularly conduct a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations where appropriate we intend to identify alternate sources of materials and services to date we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers however a continued economic decline that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our operations and sales 

in addition many of our trade customers sell products under their own private label brand that compete with products that we sell as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending during current difficult economic times our trade customers may discontinue or reduce distribution of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase their less expensive private label products to offset the adverse effect that results when some of our products are discontinued or are adversely affected by our trade customers’ actions to increase shelf space for their private label products we focus our efforts on improving distribution with other customers our results could be adversely affected if these efforts are not effective 

during 2009 one of the company’s international facilities discharged chemicals into the environment the company currently is developing a formal remediation plan and based on available information accrued approximately 3 million for remediation and related costs however we cannot assure that additional costs will not be incurred in connection with this matter 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty they are based on our historical experience our observation of trends in industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate the company’s significant accounting policies and estimates are described below

virtually all of the company’s revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered or picked up by our customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company’s products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements an approximately 17 million difference in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns the company uses experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if the company’s estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 55 million while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations during the twelve months ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately 78 million 40 million and 54 million respectively based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information 

impairment of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets and property plant and equipment 

carrying values of goodwill trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 350 intangibles—goodwill and other the company’s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trademarks and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 

the company recognized tradename impairment charges within selling general and administrative expenses for the three year period ended december 31 2009 as follows 

 

   

the tradename impairment charges recorded in 2008 were a result of management’s decision to exit a business a potential change of a brand’s name lost distribution at key customer accounts and reduced profitability the impairment charges in 2007 are also due to lost distribution at key customer accounts and reduced profitability the amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying amount fair value was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” discounted cash flow method which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change and therefore could impact fair values in the future under this method the owner of an intangible asset must determine the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license that asset from a third party the company determined that the remaining carrying value of all tradenames was recoverable based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability of the brands 

property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment in accordance with asc subtopic 360 property plant and equipment the company’s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the longlived assets are largely independent of other groups of company assets and liabilities the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology the continued success of product lines and future volume revenue and expense growth rates the company conducts annual reviews to identify idle and underutilized equipment and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when an impairment is indicated the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows 

the company recognized charges related to equipment obsolescence which occurs in the ordinary course of business and plant impairment charges during the three year period ended december 31 2009 as follows 

 

 in 2009 the company recorded a plant asset impairment charge of approximately 69 million representing the carrying value of the related assets associated with one of its international subsidiaries the company measured the impairment charge using the discounted cash flow method this subsidiary manufactures some products that compete with imports priced in us dollars as the dollar has weakened it has been necessary to lower prices in the local currency to stay competitive leading to negative cash flows which is the key input under the discounted cash flow method the charge is included in cost of sales in the specialty products division segment income statement the 32 million charge recorded in the consumer domestic segment in 2009 is primarily a result of a lack of acceptance of certain products by our key customers that resulted in a decline of forecasted future cash flows and reduced profitability the charges in 2008 and 2007 are due to the idling of certain equipment the estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations nevertheless future outcomes may differ materially from management’s estimates if the company’s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized then the company’s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 

  

inventory valuation 

when appropriate the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value which reflects any costs to sell or dispose the company identifies any slow moving obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is needed the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company’s products technological changes and new product introductions in addition the company’s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units “skus” the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were 88 million at december 31 2009 and 107 million at december 31 2008 

valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs 

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets 

the discount rate is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the company’s pension plans and postretirement plans the company refers to an applicable index and expected term of benefit payments to select a discount rate at which it believes the pension benefits could be effectively settled based on the published rate as of december 31 2009 that matched estimated cash flows for the plans the company used a discount rate of 575 for its domestic plan the company’s weighted average discount rate for all pension plans as of december 31 2009 is 576 as compared to 658 used at december 31 2008 

the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans the asset mix of the plans and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation based on these factors the company’s weighted average expected longterm rate of return for 2009 was 672 a decrease of almost 50 basis points from the 721 rate used in 2008 a 50 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return would result in less than a 06 million change in pension expense for 2010 

as noted above changes in assumptions used by management may result in material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs in 2009 other comprehensive income reflected a 57 million increase in pension plan obligations and a 05 million decrease for postretirement benefit plans the changes are primarily related to the change in discount rates for all plans 

the company made cash contributions of approximately 74 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2009 the company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately 18 million in 2010 

on january 27 2010 the company’s board of directors approved the termination effective april 15 2010 of the domestic defined benefit pension plan under which approximately 766 participants including 46 active employees have accrued benefits the company anticipates completing the termination of this plan in late 2010 or early 2011 once regulatory approvals are obtained to effect the termination the company estimates based on december 31 2009 valuations that it will be required to contribute approximately 11 million to 14 million to the plan primarily to enable the plan to purchase annuities to provide for accrued benefits the company estimates that a onetime expense of approximately 20 million to 23 million will be incurred when the annuities are purchased this expense is primarily attributable to pension settlement accounting rules that require accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that previously were to be amortized over the expected benefit lives of participants the contributions and expense are subject to change based on the valuations at the actual date of settlement 

  

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized the company records liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under asc subtopic 74010 income taxes the liabilities relate to tax return positions that although supportable by the company may be challenged by the tax authorities the company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change in this regard settlement of any issue or an adverse determination in litigation with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate conversely favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate the company’s policy for recording interest associated with income tax examinations is to record interest as a component of income before income taxes

cash flow analysis 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities —the company’s net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 increased 648 million to 4010 million as compared to 2008 the increase was primarily due to higher net income higher deferred income taxes higher depreciation and noncash compensation expense and favorable changes in working capital exclusive of cash and higher equity earnings from affiliates in addition cash flow from operations in 2008 was reduced by the gain recorded on the sale of brotherton see note 9 

for the year ended december 31 2009 the components of working capital that significantly affected operating cash flow are as follows 

accounts receivable decreased 62 million due to the timing of cash receipts 

inventories increased 106 million primarily to support higher anticipated sales and a temporary increase due to the startup of the york pennsylvania plant 

accounts payable and other accrued expenses increased 127 million primarily due to higher accruals for marketing expenditures incentive and profit sharing compensation and exit costs associated with the north brunswick facility 

income taxes payable increased 174 million due to higher tax expense associated with increased earnings and the timing of payments 

other liabilities increased 100 million due to additional deferred compensation and the appreciation in value of participant account balances relating to compensation previously deferred 

net cash used in investing activities —net cash used in investing activities during 2009 was 1041 million reflecting 1354 million of property plant and equipment expenditures including approximately 85 million for the york pennsylvania facility discussed in the following paragraph partially offset by approximately 301 million of proceeds received from the sale of certain personal care product lines initially acquired in the orajel acquisition and a 13 million payment received on an outstanding note receivable

net cash used in financing activities —net cash used in financing activities during 2009 was 583 million this reflects a net decrease in debt of 406 million resulting from mandatory payments on the term loan of 715 million and payments of cash dividends of 323 million these cash decreases were partially offset by an increase in short term borrowings of 290 million associated with the company’s accounts receivable securitization facility and proceeds of and tax benefits from stock option exercises aggregating 150 million see “market risk” below for management’s discussion of interest rate risk

interest rate risk 

the company had outstanding total debt at december 31 2009 of 8163 million of which 2500 million or 31 carries a fixed rate of interest the remaining debt balance primarily is comprised of 5314 million in term loans under the company’s principal credit facilities 300 million outstanding under a receivables purchase agreement and 49 million in international debt 

the company entered into two cash flow hedge zero cost collar agreements each covering a notional amount of 1000 million to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on a portion of its term loan indebtedness one agreement was effective as of september 29 2006 and expires on september 31 2011 and the other effective as of december 29 2006 and expired on december 31 2009 the hedge agreements each have a cap of 650 and a floor of 357 the company recorded a charge to interest expense of 55 million in 2009 with respect to the hedge agreements the company estimates it will recognize approximately 27 million in interest expense under the remaining hedge agreement in 2010 changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedge agreement are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet the company has no immediate plans to replace the interest rate collar that matured on december 31 2009 

in addition the company entered into interest rate swap hedge agreements covering a notional amount of 1500 million effective as of june 26 2009 to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on a portion of its term loan indebtedness the interest rate swap hedge agreements have terms of two years and a fixed rate of 138 the company estimates it will recognize approximately 07 million in interest expense under the interest rate swap hedge agreements in 2010 changes in the fair value of interest rate swap hedge agreements are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the company’s cash flow hedge zero cost collar and interest rate swap hedge agreements 

the weighted average interest rate on all company borrowings at december 31 2009 giving effect to the cash flow hedge zero cost collar and interest rate swap agreements and excluding deferred financing costs and commitment fees was approximately 32 

if the variable rate on the company’s floating rate debt outstanding on december 31 2009 were to change by 100 basis points from the december 31 2009 level annual interest expense associated with the floating rate debt would change by approximately 32 million 

  

diesel fuel hedge 

the company uses independent freight carriers to deliver its products these carriers charge the company a basic rate per mile that is subject to a mileage surcharge for diesel fuel price increases in july 2008 and april 2009 in response to increasing fuel prices and a concomitant increase in mileage surcharges the company entered into agreements with two financial counterparties to hedge approximately 13 of its notional diesel fuel requirements for 2010 the company uses the hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices and related fuel surcharges and not to speculate in the future price of diesel fuel the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to the company’s product costs enabling the company to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in diesel fuel prices over the term of the contract 

because the diesel hedge agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting under asc subtopic 81520 derivatives and hedging hedging—general the company is required to mark the agreements to market throughout the life of the agreements and record changes in fair value in the consolidated statement of income the loss recorded net of deferred taxes as a result of changes in the fair value of the diesel fuel hedge agreements was immaterial for the year ended december 31 2009 if future diesel prices were to change by 010 per gallon the impact on the 2010 earnings due to the hedge agreements would be approximately 02 million

equity derivatives 

the company has entered into equity derivative contracts of its own stock in order to minimize the impact on earnings resulting from fluctuations in the liability to plan participants as a result of changes in quoted fair values with respect to contributions designated by the participants for notional investments in company stock under the company’s deferred compensation plan

competition for consumer domestic and consumer international 

the company competes in the oral care and personal care and deodorizing markets using the strengths of its trademarks and technologies these are highly innovative markets characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and requiring heavy advertising and promotion 

the domestic condom market is highly concentrated in product offerings with a limited number of competitors the market is divided between premium brands and price brands with companies competing on the basis of quality innovation and price 

the domestic depilatories and waxes market is highly concentrated with a limited number of competitors products compete based on their functionality innovation and price 

internationally the company’s products compete in similar competitive categories 

many of the company’s competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company sun products corporation the clorox company colgatepalmolive company sc johnson  son inc henkel ag  co kgaa reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson inverness medical innovations inc and ssl international plc many of these companies have greater financial resources than the company and have the capacity to outspend the company if they attempt to gain market share 

  

consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced such as laundry and household cleaning products are subject to significant price competition from time to time the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share 

product introductions typically involve heavy marketing costs in the year of launch and the company usually is not able to determine whether the new products and line extensions will be successful until some time following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product line 

because of the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from customers particularly the highvolume retail store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms these concessions or terms could reduce the company’s margins furthermore if the company is unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to its trade customers the customers could increase product purchases from competitors and reduce purchases from the company which would harm the company’s sales and profitability

the company’s 998 owned brazilian subsidiary quimica geral do nordeste “qgn” is south america’s leading provider of sodium bicarbonate 

the company and occidental petroleum corporation are equal partners in a joint venture armand products company which produces and markets potassium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate potassium chemicals are sold to among others the glass industry for use in tv and computer monitor screens armand products also manufactures for the company a potassium carbonatebased animal feed additive for sale in the dairy industry 

animal nutrition products 

a special grade of sodium bicarbonate as well as sodium sesquicarbonate is sold to the animal feed market as a feed additive for use by dairymen as a buffer or antacid for dairy cattle the company also markets and sells dcad plus feed grade potassium carbonate as a feed additive into the animal feed market 

the company manufactures markets and sells megalac rumen bypass fat a nutritional supplement made from natural oils which enables cows to maintain energy levels during the period of high milk production resulting in improved milk yields and minimized weight loss the product and the trademark megalac are licensed under a longterm license agreement from a british company volac ltd

competition for spd 

in the specialty products segment competition within the specialty chemicals and animal nutrition product lines remains intense the specialty chemicals business operates in a competitive environment influenced by capacity utilization buyers’ leverage and the impact of raw material and energy costs product introductions typically involve introductory costs in the year of launch and the company usually is not able to determine whether new products and line extensions will be successful until some time following the introduction of new products or the extension of the product lines 

  

distribution for spd 

in the spd segment the company markets sodium bicarbonate and other chemicals to industrial and agricultural customers primarily throughout the united states and canada distribution is accomplished through a dedicated sales force supplemented by manufacturer’s representatives and the sales personnel of independent distributors throughout the country the company’s products in this segment are located in company plants and public warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking companies or picked up by customers at the company’s facilities 

raw materials and sources of supply 

the company manufactures sodium bicarbonate for both its consumer and specialty products businesses at its plants located at green river wyoming and old fort ohio the primary source of soda ash a basic raw material used by the company in the production of sodium bicarbonate is the mineral trona which is found in abundance in southwestern wyoming near the company’s green river plant the company has adequate trona reserves under mineral leases to support the company’s sodium bicarbonate requirements for the foreseeable future 

the company is party to a partnership agreement with general chemical corporation which mines and processes trona reserves in wyoming through the partnership and related supply and services agreements the company fulfills a substantial amount of its soda ash requirements enabling the company to achieve some of the economies of an integrated business capable of producing sodium bicarbonate and related products from the basic raw material the company also has an agreement for the supply of soda ash from another company the partnership agreement and other supply agreements between the company and general chemical are terminable upon two years notice by either company the company believes that alternative sources of supply are available 

the company believes that ample sources of raw materials are available for all of its other major products detergent chemicals are used in a variety of the company’s products and are available from a number of sources bottles paper products and clay are available from multiple suppliers although the company chooses to source most of these materials from single sources under longterm supply agreements in order to gain favorable pricing the company also uses a palm oil fraction in its rumen bypass fats products alternative sources of supply are available in case of disruption or termination of the agreements 

continuing a trend that began in 2005 the cost of raw materials was substantially higher in 2008 although by the end of 2008 the cost of many of these raw materials retreated from midyear highs despite a second half reduction in cost of many raw materials the cost of soda ash surfactants diesel fuel corrugated paper liner board and oilbased raw and packaging materials used in the household and specialty products businesses were all higher at the end of 2008 than the prior year average moreover the price of palm fatty acid distillate pfad which generally fluctuates with the price of global vegetable oil was substantially higher in 2008 although it too had eased off of midyear highs by the end of the year the company offset these increases in 2008 through savings realized in cost improvement programs and price increases on many of its products despite a second half reduction in the cost of most commodities some commodities continued to rise in price additional increases in the prices of certain raw materials could further materially impact the company’s costs and financial results if the company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers 

the company utilizes the services of third party contract manufacturers for certain products including spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrushes that are made by two contract manufacturers located in china 

following the orajel acquisition certain products acquired in the transaction were manufactured for the company by coty inc pursuant to a transition manufacturing agreement the company currently is integrating the manufacturing of these products at an existing company facility which is expected to be completed by the end of 2009

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risks and uncertainties as well as others described elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

 uncertainty about current global economic conditions has affected demand for many products factors that can affect demand include rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior while the company’s products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products they may become subject to increasing price competition as recessionary conditions continue moreover some of our products such as laundry additives and battery operated toothbrushes are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of our customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs pet specialty stores and dollar stores have experienced declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all in response we conducted a review of the financial strength of our key customers during the fourth quarter of 2008 and we continue to monitor these customers as appropriate we modified customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales we have conducted a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations where appropriate we intend to identify alternate sources of materials and services to date we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers however a continued economic decline that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our operations and sales 

the banking system and financial markets have experienced severe disruption in recent months including among other things bank failures and consolidations severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades declines in asset valuations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates these conditions present the following risks to us among others 

 

  

 we have not been notified of any circumstances that would prevent any participating financial institution from funding our revolving credit agreement or term loan accordion feature or from participating in our securitization facility in february 2010 however under current or future circumstances such constraints may exist although we believe that our operating cash flows together with our access to the credit markets provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity the inability of one or more institutions to fund the credit facilities or participate in our securitization facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 

  

the recent economic crisis also has resulted in a decline in prices of securities in the public trading markets as a result our pension funding requirements have increased in the fourth quarter of 2008 we contributed 86 million to our defined benefit plans to help mitigate reduction in asset values a continued decline in the public trading markets could result in the need to provide additional funding 

 

 the economic crisis has caused many of our trade customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell which may result in the reduction or discontinuance of certain of our product lines particularly those products that are not number one or two in their category if this occurs and we are unable to improve distribution for those products at other trade customers our company’s results could be adversely affected 

in addition many of our trade customers sell products under their own private label brand which compete with products that we sell as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending during these difficult economic times our trade customers may discontinue or reduce distribution of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase their less expensive private label products to the extent some of our products are discontinued or are adversely affected by our trade customers’ actions to increase shelf space for their private label products we are focusing our efforts on improving distribution with other customers our company’s results could be adversely affected if our efforts are not effective 

 

 our company’s financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands particularly the arm  hammer and trojan brands the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further our company’s results could be adversely affected if one of our leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues 

 

 we recently completed the conversion of our liquid laundry detergents to a more concentrated product in addition we have recently introduced or will be introducing new consumer product line extensions such as trojan 2 go and trojan ecstasy condoms nair exfoliator with microbeads baby orajel cooling cucumber teething gel baby orajel tooth and gum cleanser arm  hammer total 2in1 dryer cloths and oxiclean max force a concentrated stain remover the development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development and marketing expenditures which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of our existing products our financial performance could be harmed 

 

 in the past we have discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs we may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand moreover product efficacy or safety concerns could result in product recalls product returns or recalls writeoffs or shutdown costs would reduce sales cash flow and earnings 

  

 during 2008 approximately 78 of our sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes antiperspirants and deodorants our unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of our products by consumers product innovation and our ability to capture market share from competitors we may not succeed in implementing strategies to increase domestic revenues 

the consumer products industry particularly the laundry detergent personal care and air deodorizer categories is intensely competitive to protect existing market share or to capture increased market share we may need to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and introduce and establish new products increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing market share and could result in lower sales and profits many of our competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company sun products corporation the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel ag  co kgaa ssl international plc reckitt benckiser group plc johnson  johnson inverness medical innovations inc and sc johnson  son inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and therefore have the capacity to outspend us should they attempt to gain market share if we lose market share and the markets in which we compete do not grow our sales levels and operating results will decline 

 

 in conjunction with the 2005 spinbrush acquisition from procter  gamble the company received a royalty free license to use the crest tradename until october 29 2009 and procter  gamble agreed to refrain from using the crest tradename for two years thereafter the company recently completed a transition plan to remove the crest tradename from its spinbrush products the company cannot predict the effect of the loss of the tradename will have on spinbrush sales and profitability 

 

 consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced like many of our products are subject to significant price competition from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase prices less than the amount necessary to cover manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices or inability to raise prices sufficiently to cover manufacturing cost increases in response to these pressures would harm profit margins in addition if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins our results of operations would suffer 

because of the competitive environment facing retailers many of our trade customers particularly our highvolume retail store customers have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms our margins are reduced further if we are unable to maintain terms that are acceptable to our trade customers these trade customers could reduce purchases of our products and increase purchases of products from our competitors which would harm our sales and profitability 

  

 from time to time our retail customers have reduced inventory levels in managing their working capital requirements any reduction in inventory levels by our retail customers would result in reduced orders and harm our operating results for the financial periods affected by the reductions in particular continued consolidation within the retail industry could potentially reduce inventory levels maintained by our retail customers which could result in reduced orders and adversely affect our results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions 

 

 our performance also depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and by the financial difficulties of retailers industry wide consumer products such as those marketed by us are increasingly being sold by club stores and mass merchandisers while sales of consumer products by food and drug stores comprise a smaller proportion of the total volume of consumer products sold sales of our products are stronger in the food and drug channels of trade and not as strong with the club stores and mass merchandisers although we have taken steps to improve sales by club stores and mass merchandisers if we are not successful in improving sales to these channels and the current trend continues our financial condition and operating results could suffer 

 

 walmart including its affiliate sam’s club is our largest customer accounting for approximately 22 of net sales in 2008 22 of net sales in 2007 and 21 of net sales in 2006 our top three consumer domestic customers accounted for approximately 31 of net sales in 2008 30 of net sales in 2007 and 29 of net sales in 2006 the loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by walmart or any of our other top customers would harm our sales and profitability 

 

 as of december 31 2008 we had 8561 million of total consolidated indebtedness this level of indebtedness could i limit our ability to borrow money to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements and other financing needs and ii make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business industry or the economy in general in the event of a general increase in interest rates our interest expense would increase because a substantial portion of the indebtedness including all of the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities bears interest at floating rates to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on some of our indebtedness we entered into two cash flow hedge agreements one was effective on september 29 2006 and the other hedge was effective on december 29 2006 our failure to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the terms of our subordinated notes and agreement relating to our principal credit facilities place a limit on the amount of certain cash payments we can make this limitation includes the amount we can pay in dividends on our common stock as long as we are not in default under the subordinated notes or the agreement we do not anticipate that the limitation will have an effect on our ability to pay dividends at the current rate 

  

 we have made several acquisitions including businesses previously operated by del pharmaceuticals inc and orange glo international inc the spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrush brand a skin care brand in south america and the former consumer products businesses of carterwallace inc and may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future any future acquisitions or investments would entail various risks including the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of our ongoing business and generally our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent we acquire businesses that have operations or sources of supply outside of the united states and canada such as the spinbrush business for which products are manufactured by third party contract manufacturers in china and the skin care brand in south america for which products are manufactured locally by third parties these factors could harm our financial condition and operating results any future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the issuance of new equity by us andor the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and divert other resources from other matters that are critical to our operations 

 

 our distribution of condoms under the trojan and other trademarks is regulated by the us food and drug administration “fda” certain of our condoms and similar condoms sold by our competitors contain the spermicide nonoxynol9 “n9” some interested groups have issued reports that n9 should not be used rectally or for multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse in late 2008 the fda issued final labeling guidance for latex condoms but excluded n9 lubricated condoms from the guidance while we await further fda guidance on n9 lubricated condoms we believe that our present labeling for condoms with n9 is compliant with the overall objectives of the fda’s guidance and that condoms with n9 will remain a viable contraceptive choice for those couples who wish to use them however we cannot predict the nature of the labeling that ultimately will be required by the fda if the fda or state governments eventually promulgate rules that prohibit or restrict the use of n9 in condoms such as new labeling requirements we could incur costs from obsolete products packaging or raw materials and sales of condoms could decline which in turn could decrease our operating income 

 

 operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism pandemics fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations 

the company is constructing a new integrated laundry detergent manufacturing plant and distribution center in york county pennsylvania construction began in september 2008 and the facility is scheduled to be operational by the end of 2009 in conjunction with the opening of the new facility the company will close its existing laundry detergent manufacturing plant and distribution facilities in north brunswick new jersey this is a significant project for the company both in cost and scope if the project is delayed or the york plant upon completion does not provide expected manufacturing efficiencies the company’s ability to meet customer demand for its liquid laundry detergent would be impaired which would adversely affect sales and income 

  

 increases in the prices of raw materials such as surfactants which are cleaning agents palm oil paper products and bottles or increases in energy costs could significantly affect our profit margins in particular during the past few years we have experienced extraordinary price increases for raw and packaging materials diesel fuel and energy costs concerns about the adequacy of oil supply in the face of increasing demand continued to affect pricing we use surfactants and bottles in the manufacture and marketing of laundry and household cleaning products we use paper products for packaging in many of our consumer and specialty chemical products we use palm oil in certain of our animal nutrition products we have attempted to address these price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of our own products entering into prebuying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel costs as noted below if raw material price increases continue to occur we may not be able to fully offset those price increases this could harm our financial condition and operating results 

the company uses independent freight carriers to deliver its products these carriers charge the company a basic rate per mile that is subject to a mileage surcharge for diesel fuel price increases in response to increasing fuel prices and a concomitant increase in mileage surcharges the company entered into an agreement in january 2008 with a financial institution to hedge approximately 50 of its notional diesel fuel requirements for 2008 and an additional agreement in july 2008 to hedge approximately 20 of its notional diesel fuel requirements for 2009 it is the company’s policy to use the hedges to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices and related fuel surcharges and not to speculate in the future price of diesel fuel the hedge agreements were designed to add stability to the company’s product costs enabling the company to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in diesel fuel prices over the term of the contracts 

because the diesel hedge agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” the company is required to mark the agreements to market throughout the life of the agreements since july 2008 the price of diesel fuel has fallen thus creating a liability and a charge during 2008 as a result of continuing price declines in diesel fuel a 45 million loss was recorded in 2008 fluctuating diesel fuel prices in 2009 will affect the value of the hedge agreement covering 2009 and further declines in diesel fuel prices would result in additional charges if future diesel prices were to decline by 010 per gallon the impact to the 2009 financial statements due to the hedge agreements would be approximately 02 million 

 

 the manufacturing processing formulation packaging labeling and advertising of our products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the federal trade commission “ftc” and the consumer product safety commission in addition our operations are subject to the oversight of the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold 

in particular the fda regulates the safety manufacturing labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits and overthecounter pharmaceuticals the fda also exercises a somewhat less rigorous oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of our other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that we use to manufacture regulated products and may observe compliance 

  

issues that would require us to make certain changes in our manufacturing facilities and processes we may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until a compliance issue has been remediated as a result our business could be adversely affected 

our international operations including the production of overthecounter drug products are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which we manufacture or market goods changes in product standards or manufacturing requirements in any of these jurisdictions could require us to make certain modifications to our operations or product formulations or to cease manufacturing certain products completely as a result our international business could be adversely affected 

 

 our international operations subject us to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in all foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the united states and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flow into us dollars outside the united states sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the euro british pound brazilian real canadian dollar mexican peso chinese yuan and australian dollar a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated may decrease operating profits and cash flow 

 

 we must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

 the company may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products claims could be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s sales and operating results in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective the company could be required to recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy 

  

 we rely on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or if necessary successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

overview 

the company develops manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer and specialty products it recognizes revenues and profits from selling its products under a variety of brands including arm  hammer and trojan to consumers through supermarkets drug stores and mass merchandisers and to industrial customers and distributors 

the company operates in three primary segments consumer domestic consumer international and specialty products the consumer domestic segment includes household products for deodorizing such as arm  hammer baking soda and cat litter products laundry and cleaning products such as xtra and arm  hammer laundry detergents oxiclean prewash laundry additive scrub free kaboom orange glo and brillo cleaning products and personal care products such as trojan condoms orajel oral analgesics nair depilatories and waxes first response and answer home pregnancy and ovulation test kits arrid and arm  hammer antiperspirant and spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrushes our consumer international segment sells a variety of personal care and to a lesser extent household products some of which use the same brands as our domestic product lines in international markets including france the united kingdom canada mexico australia brazil and china our specialty products “spd” segment is the largest us producer of sodium bicarbonate which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial institutional medical and food applications this segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products for the twelve months ended december 31 2008 our consumer domestic consumer international and specialty products segments represented approximately 71 17 and 12 respectively of net sales 

on february 29 2008 the company sold its whollyowned british subsidiary brotherton speciality products ltd “brotherton” for a total of 112 million net of fees the sale resulted in a pretax gain of 30 million which was included as a reduction of selling general and administrative “sga” expenses in the specialty products segment 

on june 5 2008 the company announced plans to construct a new integrated laundry detergent manufacturing plant and distribution center in york county pennsylvania construction began in september 2008 and the facility is scheduled to be operational by the end of 2009 in conjunction with the opening of the new facility the company will close its existing laundry detergent manufacturing plant and distribution facility in north brunswick new jersey the company’s existing north brunswick complex is comprised of five separate buildings which have resulted in significant inefficiencies and cannot accommodate expansion to address expected future growth the company plans to provide severance and transition benefits to approximately 300 affected employees at the north brunswick complex as well as consideration for employment opportunities at other company operations 

on july 7 2008 the company purchased substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of del laboratories inc the “orajel acquisition” for 3834 million in connection with the acquisition the company increased its bank debt by 2500 million the balance of the acquisition cost 1334 million including fees was funded with available cash the terms and conditions of the additional borrowing are consistent with those of the company’s existing bank debt 

on august 29 2008 the company sold its consumer international subsidiary in spain for a total of 60 million the transaction resulted in a pretax charge of 35 million which has been recorded in sga expense for the consumer international segment as a result of the sale a 40 million tax benefit also was recorded as a reduction to tax expense 

  

the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the company’s results of operations commencing with their respective acquisition dates 

continuing a trend that began in 2005 the cost of raw materials was substantially higher in 2008 although by the end of 2008 the cost of many of these raw materials retreated from midyear highs despite a second half reduction in cost of many raw materials the cost of soda ash surfactants diesel fuel corrugated paper liner board and oilbased raw and packaging materials used in the household and specialty products businesses were all higher at the end of 2008 than the prior year average moreover the price of palm fatty acid distillate pfad which generally fluctuates with the price of global vegetable oil was substantially higher in 2008 although it too had eased off of midyear highs by the end of the year the company offset these increases in 2008 through savings realized in cost improvement programs and price increases on many of its products despite a second half reduction in the cost of most commodities some commodities continued to rise in price additional increases in the prices of certain raw materials could further materially impact the company’s costs and financial results if the company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers 

the company operates in highly competitive consumer product markets in which cost efficiency new product offerings and innovation are critical to success the consumer products markets are particularly mature in north america and are characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to the company’s most significant product categories such as laundry detergents and oral care furthermore because of ongoing retail sector consolidation and the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from these customers particularly the highvolume retail store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to protect its existing market share or to capture additional market share the company increased expenditures for promotions and advertising and introduced new products and line extensions in order to fund the additional marketing expenses the company has and continues to pursue ongoing cost cutting initiatives as a result of its acquisitions and cost improvement initiatives the company has been able to lower its overall unit costs and increase the productivity of its various manufacturing facilities 

uncertainty about current global economic conditions has affected demand for many products factors that can affect demand include rates of unemployment consumer confidence health care costs fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior while the company’s products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products they may become subject to increasing price competition as recessionary conditions continue moreover some of our products such as laundry additives and battery operated toothbrushes are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending 

some of our customers including mass merchandisers supermarkets drugstores convenience stores wholesale clubs pet specialty stores and dollar stores have experienced declining financial performance which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all in response we conducted a review of the financial strength of our key customers during the fourth quarter of 2008 and we continue to monitor these customers as appropriate we modified customer credit limits which may have an adverse impact on future sales we have conducted a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations where appropriate we intend to identify alternate sources of materials and services to date we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers however a continued economic decline that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our operations and sales 

in addition many of our trade customers sell products under their own private label brand which compete with products that we sell as consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending during these difficult economic times our trade customers may discontinue or reduce distribution of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase their less expensive private label products to the extent some of our products are discontinued or are adversely affected by our trade customers’ actions to increase shelf space for their private label products we are focusing our efforts on improving distribution with other customers our company’s results could be adversely affected if our efforts are not effective 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty they are based on our historical experience our observation of trends in industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate our critical accounting policies are described below 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves 

virtually all of the company’s revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered or picked up by our customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company’s products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements an approximately 08 million difference in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns the company uses experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if the company’s estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 60 million while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations during the twelve months ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 the company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately 40 million 54 million and 45 million respectively based on actual experience and updated information 

impairment of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets and property plant and equipment 

carrying values of goodwill trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the company’s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trademarks and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 

  

the company recognized tradename impairment charges within selling general and administrative expenses for the three year period ended december 31 2008 as follows in millions 

 

 the tradename impairment charges recorded in 2008 were a result of management’s decision to exit a business a potential change of a brand’s name lost distribution at key customer accounts and reduced profitability the impairment charges in 2007 and 2006 are also due to lost distribution at key customer accounts and reduced profitability the amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying amount fair value was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” discounted cash flow method which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change and therefore could impact fair values in the future under this method the owner of an intangible asset must determine the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license that asset from a third party in addition the carrying amount of amortizable tradenames declined during 2008 due to the sale of the company’s subsidiary in spain the company determined that the remaining carrying value of all tradenames was recoverable based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability of the brands 

property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the company’s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the longlived assets are largely independent of other groups of company assets and liabilities the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology the continued success of product lines and future volume revenue and expense growth rates the company conducts annual reviews to identify idle and underutilized equipment and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when an impairment is indicated the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows 

the company recognized charges related to equipment obsolescence which occur in the ordinary course of business and plant impairment charges during the three year period ended december 31 2008 as follows in millions 

 

 the estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations future outcomes may also differ materially from management’s estimates if the company’s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized then the company’s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 

  

inventory valuation 

when appropriate the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value which reflects any costs to sell or dispose the company identifies any slow moving obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is needed the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company’s products technological changes and new product introductions in addition the company’s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units “skus” the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were 107 million at december 31 2008 and 97 million at december 31 2007 

valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs 

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets 

the discount rate is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the company’s pension plans and postretirement plans the company refers to an applicable index and expected cash flows to select a rate at which it believes the pension benefits could be effectively settled based on the published rate as of december 31 2008 that matched estimated cash flows for the plans the company used a discount rate of 625 for its domestic plan the company’s weighted average discount rate for all pension plans as of december 31 2008 is 658 as compared to 598 used at december 31 2007 

the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans the asset mix of the plans and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation based on these factors the company’s weighted average expected longterm rate for 2008 was 721 an increase of 2 basis points from the 719 rate used in 2007 a 50 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return would result in less than a 05 million change in pension expense for 2009 

as noted above changes in assumptions used by management may result in material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs in 2008 other comprehensive income reflected a 146 million increase in pension plan obligations and a 03 million decrease for postretirement benefit plans the change to the pension plans is primarily related to the reduction in plan assets which were affected by the worldwide economic crisis and the decline in the securities markets the change to postretirement plans is due to the change in discount rate at the company’s canadian facility 

the company made cash contributions of approximately 146 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2008 the company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately 46 million in 2009 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely 

  

than not” to be realized the company records liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under financial accounting standard board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” the liabilities relate to tax return positions that although supportable by the company may be challenged by the tax authorities the company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations settlement of any issue or an adverse determination in litigation with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate conversely favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate

net sales 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2008 were 24224 million an increase of 2015 million or 91 above 2007 net sales of the increase 16 is due to sales of products acquired in the orajel acquisition partially offset by the loss of sales due to the divestiture in the first quarter of 2008 of brotherton speciality products ltd “brotherton” a united kingdom specialty products subsidiary and the third quarter 2008 divestiture of the company’s consumer products subsidiary in spain foreign exchange did not have a material impact for the full 2008 year the remainder of the increase is approximately equally attributable to higher volumes and higher selling prices

marketing expenses for 2008 were 2941 million an increase of 374 million as compared to 2007 the increase principally was directed to acquired businesses and certain household products

2007 compared to 2006 

net sales 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2007 were 22209 million 2753 million or 141 above last year the increase is largely due to the impact of the acquisition of the businesses formerly owned by orange glo international inc the “ogi acquisition” which occurred in august 2006 and the spinbrush toothbrush business which collectively accounted for approximately 8 of the increase in net sales the effect of foreign exchange rates accounted for approximately 1 of the increase the balance of the increase is a result of unit volume increases partially offset by higher trade promotion and slotting expenses following the acquisition of the spinbrush business in december 2005 and during the transition period prior to april 1 2006 the seller of the spinbrush business maintained responsibility for sales and other functions in the us canada and the uk therefore the company accounted for the net cash received as other revenue the company assumed

other income and expenses 

in 2007 equity in earnings of affiliates was 82 million as compared to 71 million in 2006 the increase is primarily due to the earnings of the esseco uk llp joint venture which was started in april 2006 and improved profitability of armand products

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2008 the company had 1980 million in cash 1140 million available through its 1150 million accounts receivable securitization facility approximately 950 million available under its 1000 million revolving credit facility and a 2500 million accordion feature associated with the term loan to ensure the safety of its cash resources the company invests its cash primarily in government agency money market funds 

the company renewed its accounts receivable securitization facility in february 2009 for the past several years this facility has been renewed annually and the company anticipates that this facility will be renewed in february 2010 

to date the company believes that its ability to access the sources of cash described above has not been adversely affected by recent economic events therefore the company currently does not anticipate that the credit environment will have a material adverse effect on its ability to address its current and forecasted liquidity requirements the company anticipates that its cash from operations along with its current borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure program costs including the cash requirements related to construction of its new laundry detergent and warehouse facility in york county pennsylvania discussed in this section under “net cash used in investing activities” pay its common stock dividend at current rates and meet its mandatory debt repayment schedule and minimum pension funding requirements over the next twelve months nevertheless the current economic environment presents risks that could have adverse consequences that the company does not currently anticipate will occur for further information see “economic conditions could adversely affect our business” under “risk factors” in item 1a 

in addition the company does not anticipate that current economic conditions will adversely affect its ability to comply with the financial covenants in its principal credit facilities because the company currently is and anticipates that it will continue to be well above the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement and below the maximum leverage ratio requirement these ratios are discussed in more detail in this section under the subheading “adjusted ebitda”

concentration of risk 

in each of the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 net sales to the company’s largest customer walmart stores inc and its affiliates were 22 22 and 21 respectively of the company’s total consolidated net sales 

interest rate risk 

the company has total debt outstanding at december 31 2008 of 8561 million of which 2500 million or 29 carries a fixed rate of interest the remaining debt balance is primarily comprised of 6029 million in term loans under the company’s principal credit facilities 10 million outstanding under a receivables purchase agreement and 22 million in international debt the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings at december 31 2008 excluding deferred financing costs and commitment fees was approximately 3 

the company entered into two cash flow hedge agreements each covering 1000 million of zero cost collars one effective as of september 29 2006 and the other effective as of december 29 2006 to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its term loan debt the hedge agreements have terms of five and three years respectively each with a cap of 650 and a floor of 357 the company recorded a charge to interest expense of 09 million in 2008 and estimates it will recognize approximately 32 million in interest expense in the next twelve months changes in the hedging options’ fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 

if the variable rate on the company’s floating rate debt outstanding on december 31 2008 were to change by 100 basis points from the december 31 2008 level annual interest expense associated with the floating rate debt would change by approximately 40 million 

diesel fuel hedge 

the company uses independent freight carriers to deliver its products these carriers charge the company a basic rate per mile that is subject to a mileage surcharge for diesel fuel price increases in response to increasing fuel prices and a concomitant increase in mileage surcharges the company entered into an agreement in january 2008 with a financial institution to hedge approximately 50 of its notional diesel fuel requirements for 2008 

  

and an additional agreement in july 2008 to hedge approximately 20 of its notional diesel fuel requirements for 2009 it is the company’s policy to use the hedges to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices and related fuel surcharges and not to speculate in the future price of diesel fuel the hedge agreements are designed to add stability to the company’s product costs enabling the company to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in diesel fuel prices over the term of the contract 

because the diesel hedge agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” the company is required to mark the agreements to market throughout the life of the agreements the change in the market value of the hedge agreements resulted in a 45 million loss for 2008 which is reflected in cost of sales the loss is related to the hedge contract for 2009 which was executed when diesel fuel was at close to record prices since july 2008 the price of diesel fuel has fallen thus creating a liability fluctuating diesel fuel prices in 2009 will affect the value of the hedge agreement covering 2009 if future diesel prices were to change by 010 per gallon the impact on the 2009 financial statements due to the hedge agreements would be approximately 02 million 

foreign currency 

the company is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily us dollareuro us dollarbritish pound us dollarcanadian dollar us dollarmexican peso us dollaraustralian dollar us dollarbrazilian real and us dollarchinese yuan 

the company from time to time enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated but not yet committed sales or purchases denominated in the us dollar canadian dollar british pound and euro during the fourth quarter of 2008 the company’s canadian subsidiary entered into three forward exchange contracts to protect the company from the risk that dollar net cash inflows or outflows would be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates the contracts expire early in 2009 the face value of these contracts totaled 45 million the contracts qualified for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 133 and therefore changes in the fair value through the end of 2008 were marked to market and recorded as other comprehensive income the amount recorded was less than 01 million 

the company currently has intercompany loans with certain of its subsidiaries the company is exposed to foreign exchange accounting remeasurement gains and losses from these intercompany loans the company previously entered into several foreign exchange contracts to hedge the net accounting remeasurement exposure on these loans also during the fourth quarter of 2008 the company’s brazilian subsidiary entered into a foreign exchange contract to protect a portion of its us dollar purchases the contract expired in january 2009 and had a face value of 35 million the contract did not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore the change in fair value through the end of 2008 of 03 million was recorded in other income 

equity derivatives 

the company has entered into equity derivative contracts of its own stock in order to minimize the impact on earnings resulting from fluctuations in the liability to plan participants for contributions designated to notional investment in company stock under the company’s deferred compensation plan as a result of changes in quoted fair values these contracts which consist of cash settled call options in the amount of 128 thousand shares covered approximately 71 of the notional shares in the plan and are marked to market through earnings as a result of these contracts the company recognized income of approximately 02 million in 2008 09 million in 2007 and 12 million in 2006 which reduced the total charge for deferred compensation included in sga expense

competition for consumer domestic and consumer international 

the company competes in the oral care and personal care and deodorizing businesses using the unique strengths of its trademarks and technologies these are highly innovative markets characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and requiring heavy advertising and promotion 

the domestic condom market is highly concentrated in product offerings with a limited number of competitors the market is divided between premium brands and price brands with companies competing on the basis of quality innovation and price 

the domestic depilatories and waxes market is highly concentrated with a limited number of competitors products compete based on their functionality innovation and price 

internationally the company’s products compete in similar competitive categories 

many of the company’s competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company unilever inc the clorox company colgatepalmolive company sc johnson  son inc henkel reckitt benckiser johnson  johnson inverness and ssl international many of these companies have greater financial resources than the company and have the capacity to outspend the company if they attempt to gain market share 

consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced such as laundry and household cleaning products are subject to significant price competition from time to time the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share 

product introductions typically involve heavy marketing costs in the year of launch and the company usually is not able to determine whether the new products and line extensions will be successful until some time following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product line 

because of the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from customers particularly the highvolume retail store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing 

  

concessions or better trade terms these concessions or terms could reduce the company’s margins furthermore if the company is unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to its trade customers the customers could increase product purchases from competitors and reduce purchases from the company which would harm the company’s sales and profitability 

distribution for consumer domestic

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risks and uncertainties as well as others described elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

 our company’s financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands particularly the arm  hammer and trojan brands the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers further our company’s results could be adversely affected if one of our leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues 

 

 we recently commenced the conversion of our liquid laundry detergents to a more concentrated product in addition we have recently introduced or will be introducing new consumer product line extensions such as oxiclean spray away portable stain remover spinbrush pro slim toothbrushes a twospeed spinbrush toothbrush spinbrush proselect toothbrushes trojan intense ribbed condoms and arm  hammer plus oxiclean laundry detergents the development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development and marketing expenditures which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of our existing products our financial performance could be harmed 

 

 in the past we have discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs we may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand product returns writeoffs or shutdown costs would reduce cash flow and earnings product efficacy or safety concerns could result in product recalls or declining sales which also would reduce our cash flow and earnings 

 

 during 2007 approximately 78 of our sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes antiperspirants and deodorants our unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of our products by consumers product innovation and our ability to capture market share from competitors we may not succeed in implementing strategies to increase domestic revenues 

the consumer products industry particularly the laundry detergent personal care and air deodorizer categories is intensely competitive to protect existing market share or to capture increased market share we may need to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and introduce and establish new products increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing market share and could result in lower sales and profits many of our competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company unilever inc the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel ssl international 

  

reckitt benckiser johnson  johnson inverness and sc johnson  son inc many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and therefore have the capacity to outspend us should they attempt to gain market share if we lose market share and the markets in which we compete do not grow our sales levels and operating results will decline 

 

 consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced like many of our products are subject to significant price competition and in recent years have been characterized by price deflation from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase prices less than the amount necessary to cover manufacturing cost increases to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices or inability to raise prices sufficiently to cover manufacturing cost increases in response to these pressures would harm profit margins in addition if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins our results of operations would suffer 

because of the competitive environment facing retailers many of our trade customers particularly our highvolume retail store customers have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms our margins are reduced further if we are unable to maintain terms that are acceptable to our trade customers these trade customers could reduce purchases of our products and increase purchases of products from our competitors which would harm our sales and profitability 

 

 from time to time our retail customers have reduced inventory levels in managing their working capital requirements any reduction in inventory levels by our retail customers would harm our operating results for the financial periods affected by the reductions in particular continued consolidation within the retail industry could potentially reduce inventory levels maintained by our retail customers which could adversely affect our results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions 

 

 our performance also depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and by the financial difficulties of retailers industry wide consumer products such as those marketed by us are increasingly being sold by club stores and mass merchandisers while sales of consumer products by food and drug stores are comprising a smaller proportion of the total volume of consumer products sold sales of our products are stronger in the food and drug channels of trade and not as strong with the club stores and mass merchandisers although we have taken steps to improve sales by club stores and mass merchandisers if we are not successful in improving sales to these channels and the current trend continues our financial condition and operating results could suffer 

 

 walmart including its affiliate sam’s club is our largest customer accounting for approximately 22 of net sales in 2007 21 of net sales in 2006 and 18 of net sales in 2005 our top three consumer domestic customers accounted for approximately 30 of net sales in 2007 29 of net sales in 2006 and 25 of net sales in 2005 the loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by walmart or any of our other top customers would harm our sales and profitability 

  

 as of december 31 2007 we had 8560 million of total consolidated indebtedness this level of indebtedness could i limit our ability to borrow money to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and debt service requirements and other financing needs and ii make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business industry or the economy in general in the event of a general increase in interest rates our interest expense would increase because a substantial portion of the indebtedness including all of the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities bears interest at floating rates to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on some of our indebtedness we entered into two cash flow hedge agreements one was effective on september 29 2006 and the other hedge was effective on december 29 2006 our failure to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the terms of our subordinated notes and agreement relating to our credit facility place a limit on the amount of certain cash payments we can make this limitation includes the amount we can pay in dividends on our common stock as long as we are not in default under either agreement we do not anticipate that the limitation will have an effect on our ability to pay dividends at the current rate 

 

 we have made several acquisitions in the past few years including the assets of orange glo international inc the spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrush brand a skin care brand in south america and the former consumer products businesses of carterwallace inc and may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future any future acquisitions or investments would entail various risks including the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of our ongoing business and generally our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent we acquire companies with businesses operations or sources of supply outside of the united states and canada such as the acquisition of the spinbrush business for which products are manufactured by third party contract manufacturers in china and the skin care brand in south america for which products are manufactured locally by third parties these factors could harm our financial condition and operating results any future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the issuance of new equity by us andor the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and divert other resources from other matters that are critical to our operations 

 

 our distribution of condoms under the trojan and other trademarks is regulated by the us food and drug administration “fda” certain of our condoms contain the spermicide nonoxynol9 “n9” the world health organization and other interested groups have issued reports suggesting that n9 should not be used rectally or for multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse given the ingredient’s potential to cause irritation to human membranes in 2005 the fda issued nonbinding draft guidance concerning the labeling of condoms in general and those with n9 in particular we filed a response recommending alternative labeling to the fda while awaiting further fda guidance we implemented an interim label statement change cautioning against rectal use and morethanonceaday vaginal use of condoms with n9 and launched a public information campaign to communicate these messages to the affected communities we believe that our present labeling for condoms with n9 is compliant with the overall objectives of the fda’s draft guidance and that condoms with n9 will remain a viable contraceptive choice for those couples who wish to use them however we cannot predict the nature of the labeling that ultimately will be required by the fda if the fda or state governments eventually promulgate rules which prohibit or restrict the use of n9 in condoms such as new labeling 

  

requirements we could incur costs from obsolete products packaging or raw materials and sales of condoms could decline which in turn could decrease our operating income 

 

 operations at the company’s manufacturing facilities may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism pandemics fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters if a major disruption were to occur it could result in harm to people or the natural environment delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations 

 

 increases in the prices of raw materials such as surfactants which are cleaning agents palm oil paper products and bottles or increases in energy costs could significantly affect our profit margins in particular during the past three years we have experienced extraordinary price increases for raw and packaging materials diesel fuel and energy costs concerns about the adequacy of oil supply in the face of increasing demand continued to affect pricing we use surfactants and bottles in the manufacture and marketing of laundry and household cleaning products we use paper products for packaging in many of our consumer and specialty chemical products we use palm oil in certain of our animal nutrition products we have attempted to address these price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of our own products if raw material price increases continue to occur we may not be able to increase the prices of our products to fully offset these increases this could harm our financial condition and operating results 

 

 the manufacturing processing formulation packaging labeling and advertising of our products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the federal trade commission “ftc” and the consumer product safety commission in addition our operations are subject to the oversight of the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold 

in particular the fda regulates the safety manufacturing labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits and overthecounter pharmaceuticals the fda also exercises a somewhat less rigorous oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of our other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that we use to manufacture regulated products and may observe compliance issues that would require us to make certain changes in our manufacturing facilities and processes we may be required to make additional expenditures to address these regulatory observations or possibly stop selling certain products until a compliance issue has been remediated as a result our business could be adversely affected 

our international operations including the production of overthecounter drug products are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which we manufacture or market goods changes in product standards or manufacturing requirements in any of these jurisdictions could require us to make certain modifications to our operations or product formulations or to cease manufacturing certain products completely as a result our international business could be adversely affected 

  

 our international operations subject us to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in all foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the united states and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flow into us dollars outside the united states sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the euro british pound brazilian real canadian dollar mexican peso and australian dollar a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated may decrease operating profits and cash flow 

 

 we must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

 the company may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products claims could be based on allegations that among other things the company’s products contain contaminants provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the company’s sales and operating results in addition if one of the company’s products is found to be defective the company could be required to recall it which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy 

 

 we rely on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition 

  

even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

price increase in the animal nutrition market additional increases in the prices of certain raw materials could further materially impact the company’s costs and financial results if the company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers 

the company operates in highly competitive consumer product markets in which cost efficiency new product offerings and innovation are critical to success the consumer products markets are particularly mature in north america and are characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to the company’s most significant product categories such as laundry detergents and oral care furthermore because of ongoing retail sector consolidation and the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from these customers particularly the highvolume retail store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to protect its existing market share or to capture additional market share the company increased expenditures for promotions and advertising and introduced new products and line extensions in order to fund the additional marketing expenses the company has and continues to pursue ongoing cost cutting initiatives furthermore through its acquisitions and cost improvement initiatives the company has been able to lower its overall unit costs and increase the productivity of its various manufacturing facilities 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience our observation of trends in industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate our critical accounting policies are described below 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves 

virtually all of the company’s revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered or picked up by our customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company’s products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements an approximately 19 million difference in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns the company uses experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if the company’s estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 56 million while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations during the twelve months ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 the company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately 54 million 45 million and 81 million respectively based on actual experience and updated information 

  

impairment of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets and property plant and equipment 

carrying values of goodwill trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the company’s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trademarks and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 

the company recognized tradename impairment charges within selling general and administrative expenses for the three year period ended december 31 2007 as follows 

 

 the tradename impairment charges were recorded as a result of lost distribution at key customer accounts and to a lesser extent reduced profitability the amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying amount fair value was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” discounted cash flow method under this method the owner of an intangible asset must determine the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license that asset from a third party the company determined the remaining carrying value of all tradenames was recoverable based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability of the brands the impact of the reduction in profitability was not material to the consolidated financial statements 

property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the company’s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the longlived assets are largely independent of other groups of company assets and liabilities the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology the continued success of product lines and future volume revenue and expense growth rates the company conducts annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when an impairment is indicated the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows 

the company recognized charges related to equipment obsolescence which occur in the ordinary course of business and plant impairment charges during the three year period ended december 31 2007 as follows 

 

   

the estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated value of future cash flows and would have increased or decreased any impairment charge taken future outcomes may also differ materially from management’s estimates if the company’s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized then the company’s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 

inventory valuation 

when appropriate the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value which includes any costs to sell or dispose the company identifies any slow moving obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is needed the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company’s products technological changes and new product introductions in addition the company’s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units “sku’s” the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required adjustments to the inventory’s net realizable value were 97 million at december 31 2007 and 88 million at december 31 2006 

valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs 

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 

the discount rate is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans and postretirement plans we refer to an applicable index and expected cash flows to select a rate at which we believe the pension benefits could be effectively settled based on the published rate as of december 31 2007 that matched our estimated cash flows for the plans the company used a discount rate of 625 for its domestic plan the company’s weighted average discount rate for all plans as of december 31 2007 is 598 as compared to 538 used at december 31 2006 

the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans the asset mix of the plans and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation based on these factors the company’s weighted average expected longterm rate for the 2007 year is 719 an increase of 39 basis points from the 680 rate used at december 31 2006 this increase is principally due to an increase in expected returns in the uk pension plans a 50 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return would result in less than a 06 million change in pension expense for 2008 

in 2007 the change in other comprehensive income due to sfas no 158 see “recent accounting pronouncements” below was 85 million and 23 million for pension and postretirement benefit plans respectively at december 31 2006 the adjustment to initially apply sfas no 158 to the balance sheet was an increase to the 2007 pension and postretirement accrued benefit liabilities of 07 million and 28 million respectively the amounts were recorded net of tax directly to the ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income and not as a component of comprehensive income in accordance with the new standard this change is primarily related to the change in the assumed discount rate 

  

the company made cash contributions of approximately 93 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2007 the company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately 67 million in 2008 

tax contingencies 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized the company records liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under fin 48 see “recent accounting pronouncements” below the liabilities relate to tax return positions that although supportable by the company may be challenged by the tax authorities the company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations settlement of any issue or an adverse determination in litigation with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate conversely favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate

 consumer domestic 

2007 compared to 2006 

consumer domestic net sales in 2007 were 15741 million an increase of 1856 million or approximately 13 compared to 2006 the increase is primarily due to the ogi acquisition which contributed approximately 9 of the increase and higher unit volume partially offset by higher trade promotion and slotting expenses in support of new product launches sales of arm  hammer liquid laundry detergent which include sales for the first phase of the company’s shift to concentrated liquid detergent arm  hammer super scoop cat litter trojan condoms arm  hammer dental care and pregnancy test kits were all higher than in 2006 these increases were partially offset by lower sales of other toothpaste brands and antiperspirant sales 

consumer domestic income before minority interest and income taxes in 2007 was 2072 million an increase of 407 million as compared to 2006 profits resulting from the ogi business and higher volumes were partially offset by higher trade promotion slotting expenses and marketing costs on preexisting products higher sga expenses and higher interest expense resulting from the ogi acquisition 

  

2006 compared to 2005 

consumer domestic net sales were 13885 million in 2006 an increase of 1703 million or 140 as compared to 2005 the increase is primarily due to sales of spinbrush and ogi products these acquisitions contributed approximately 1550 million of incremental net sales the company assumed responsibility for all spinbrush sales and other functions in the us canada and the uk on april 1 2006 and recognized the gross amount of sales and expenses from the spinbrush business within the consolidated statement of earnings for the us and most foreign locations during the second quarter during the transition period prior to april 1 2006 when the seller of the spinbrush business maintained these responsibilities the company accounted for the net cash received as other revenue sales of the segment’s preexisting product lines increased slightly as a result of higher prices partially offset by slightly lower volume effective february 1 2006 the company implemented price increases ranging from 4 to over 10 for products representing about 35 of its us consumer products portfolio’s net sales these products include arm  hammer and xtra liquid laundry detergents arm  hammer super scoop cat litter and arm  hammer baking soda management believes the price increase caused the company to experience lower product demand as consumers adjusted to the higher prices however management believes that these price increases have improved the company’s margins and contributed to achieving its financial goals higher sales also reflected growth in liquid laundry detergents pregnancy kits and pet care and the reduction of promotion reserves of 27 million based on updated information including actual experience partially offset by lower toothpaste and deodorant sales 

consumer domestic income before minority interest and income taxes was 1665 million in 2006 a 238 million increase as compared to 2005 the increase is primarily due to the contributions from ogi and spinbrush products and the effect of higher gross margins for liquid laundry detergents the higher profitability was partially offset by higher oilbased manufacturing and freight costs and higher sga expenses primarily stock option expense higher personnel related expenses higher research and development costs higher legal and professional fees and costs associated with the ogi and spinbrush businesses the segment’s profitability was also negatively impacted by tradename and equipment obsolescence charges of 135 million in 2006 and an increase in intangible assets amortization and higher allocated interest expense

and the skin care product acquired late in 2005 favorable exchange rates of 69 million and the reduction of promotion reserves of 18 million based on updated information including actual experience other products in the segment experienced slight volume and pricing gains strong sales in canada uk and australia were offset by lower sales of certain skin care brands in europe

competition for spd 

for information regarding competition affecting the company’s specialty products business see “competitive environment” in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which is item 7 of this report product introductions usually involve heavy introductory costs in the year of launch and the eventual success of the new products and line extensions is not known for some time afterwards 

  

distribution for spd 

in the spd segment the company markets sodium bicarbonate and other chemicals to industrial and agricultural customers primarily throughout the united states and canada distribution is accomplished through regional sales offices and manufacturer’s representatives augmented by the sales personnel of independent distributors throughout the country the company’s products in this segment are located in company plants and public warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking companies or picked up by customers at the company’s facilities 

raw materials and sources of supply 

the company manufactures sodium bicarbonate for both of its consumer and specialty products businesses at its plants located at green river wyoming and old fort ohio the primary source of soda ash a basic raw material in the production of sodium bicarbonate used by the company is the mineral trona which is found in abundance in southwestern wyoming near the company’s green river plant the company has adequate trona reserves under mineral leases to support the requirements of its sodium bicarbonate business and may acquire other leases in the future as the need arises 

the company is party to a partnership agreement with general chemical corporation which mines and processes trona reserves in wyoming through the partnership and related supply and services agreements the company fulfills a substantial amount of its soda ash requirements enabling the company to achieve some of the economies of an integrated business capable of producing sodium bicarbonate and related products from the basic raw material the company also has an agreement for the supply of soda ash from another company the partnership agreement and other supply agreements between the company and general chemical are terminable upon two years notice by either company the company believes that alternative sources of supply are available 

the company believes that ample sources of raw materials are available for all of its other major products detergent chemicals are used in a variety of the company’s products and are available from a number of sources bottles paper products and clay are available from multiple suppliers although the company chooses to source most of these materials from single sources under longterm supply agreements in order to gain favorable pricing the company also uses a palm oil fraction in its rumen bypass fats products alternative sources of supply are available in case of disruption or termination of the agreements 

continuing a trend that began in 2005 the cost of raw materials was substantially higher in 2006 particularly for oilbased raw and packaging materials used in the household and specialty products businesses in 2006 the company more than offset some of these increases with cost improvement programs and pricing actions the price of palm oil generally fluctuates with the price of global vegetable oil additional increases in the prices of certain raw materials could further materially impact the company’s costs and financial results if the company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risks and uncertainties as well as others described elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

 we have recently introduced or will be introducing new consumer product line extensions such as oxiclean spray away portable stain remover spinbrush pro slim toothbrushes a twospeed spinbrush toothbrush and trojan intense ribbed condoms in 2005 we introduced elexa a line of sexual health products which did not meet our expectations the development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development and marketing expenditures which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of our existing products our financial performance could be harmed 

 

 in the past we have discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs we may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand product returns writeoffs or shutdown costs would reduce cash flow and earnings product efficacy or safety concerns could result in product recalls or declining sales which also would reduce our cash flow and earnings 

 

 during 2006 approximately 79 of our sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers household cleaning products toothpastes antiperspirants and deodorants our unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of our products by consumers product innovation and our ability to capture market share from competitors we may not succeed in implementing strategies to increase domestic revenues 

the consumer products industry particularly the laundry detergent personal care and air deodorizer categories is intensely competitive to protect existing market share or to capture increased market share we may need to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and introduce and establish new products increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing market share and could result in lower sales and profits many of our competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company unilever inc the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel ssl international reckitt benckiser johnson  johnson inverness and sc johnson  son inc many of which have greater financial resources than we do these competitors have the capacity to outspend us should they attempt to gain market share if we lose market share and the markets in which we compete do not grow our sales levels and operating results will decline 

 

 consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced like many of our products are subject to significant price competition and in recent years have been characterized by price deflation from time to time 

  

we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices to respond to these pressures would harm profit margins in addition if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins our results of operations would suffer 

because of the competitive environment facing retailers many of our trade customers particularly our highvolume retail store customers have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms our margins are reduced further if we are unable to maintain terms that are acceptable to our trade customers these trade customers could reduce purchases of our products and increase purchases of products from our competitors which would harm our sales and profitability 

 

 from time to time our retail customers have reduced inventory levels in managing their working capital requirements any reduction in inventory levels by our retail customers would harm our operating results for the financial periods affected by the reductions in particular continued consolidation within the retail industry could potentially reduce inventory levels maintained by our retail customers which could adversely affect our results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions 

 

 our performance also depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and by the financial difficulties of retailers industry wide consumer products such as those marketed by us are increasingly being sold by club stores and mass merchandisers while sales of consumer products by food and drug stores are comprising a smaller proportion of the total volume of consumer products sold sales of our products are stronger in the food and drug channels of trade and not as strong with the club stores and mass merchandisers although we have taken steps to improve sales by club stores and mass merchandisers if we are not successful in improving sales to these channels and the current trend continues our financial condition and operating results could suffer 

 

 walmart including its affiliate sam’s club is our largest customer accounting for approximately 21 of net sales in 2006 18 of net sales in 2005 and 18 of net sales in 2004 our top three consumer domestic customers accounted for approximately 29 of net sales in 2006 25 of net sales in 2005 and 26 of net sales in 2004 the loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by walmart or any of our other top customers would harm our sales and profitability 

 

 as of december 31 2006 we had 9333 million of total consolidated indebtedness this level of indebtedness could i limit our ability to borrow money to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and debt service requirements and other financing needs and ii make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business industry or the economy in general in the event of a general increase in interest rates our interest expense would increase because a substantial portion of the indebtedness including all of the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities bears interest at floating rates to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on some of our indebtedness we entered into two cash flow hedge agreements one was effective on september 29 2006 and the other hedge was effective on december 29 2006 our failure to service our 

  

indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the terms of our subordinated notes and agreement relating to our credit facility place a limit on the amount of certain cash payments we can make this limitation includes the amount we can pay in dividends on our common stock as long as we are not in default under either agreement we do not anticipate that the limitation will have an effect on our ability to pay dividends at the current rate 

 

 we have made several acquisitions in the past few years including the ogi acquisition the spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrush brand a skin care brand in south america and the former consumer products businesses of carterwallace inc and may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future any future acquisitions or investments would entail various risks including the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of our ongoing business and generally our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent we acquire companies with businesses operations or sources of supply outside of the united states and canada such as the acquisition of the spinbrush business for which products are manufactured by third party contract manufacturers in china and the skin care brand in south america for which products are manufactured locally by third parties these factors could harm our financial condition and operating results any future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the issuance of new equity by us andor the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not they are ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and divert other resources from other matters that are critical to our operations 

 

 our distribution of condoms under the trojan and other trademarks is regulated by the us food and drug administration fda certain of our condoms contain the spermicide nonoxynol9 n9 the world health organization and other interested groups have issued reports suggesting that n9 should not be used rectally or for multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse given the ingredient’s potential to cause irritation to human membranes the fda has recently issued nonbinding draft guidance concerning the labeling of condoms in general and those with n9 in particular we have filed a response recommending alternative labeling with the fda we believe that our present labeling for condoms with n9 is compliant with the overall objectives of the draft guidance and that condoms with n9 will remain a viable contraceptive choice for those couples who wish to use them however we cannot predict the nature of the labeling that ultimately will be required by the fda while awaiting further fda guidance we have implemented an interim label statement change cautioning against rectal use and morethanonceaday vaginal use of condoms with n9 and have launched a public information campaign to communicate these messages to the affected communities 

if the fda or state governments eventually promulgate rules which prohibit or restrict the use of n9 in condoms such as new or additional labeling requirements we could incur costs from obsolete products packaging or raw materials and sales of condoms could decline which in turn could decrease our operating income 

 

 increases in the prices of raw materials such as surfactants which are cleaning agents paper products and bottles or increases in energy costs could significantly affect our profit margins in particular during 2005 and 2006 we experienced extraordinary price increases for raw and packaging materials diesel fuel and energy costs 

  

particularly as a result of strong demand from china and supply interruptions in 2005 caused by hurricanes katrina and rita the damage to oil and chemical production facilities in the gulf region resulted in widespread shortages that extended into 2006 these shortages coupled with concerns about the adequacy of oil supply continued to impact pricing we use surfactants and bottles in the manufacture and marketing of laundry and household cleaning products we use paper products for packaging in many of our consumer and specialty chemical products we have attempted to address these price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of our own products if price increases continue to occur we may not be able to increase the prices of our products to fully offset these increases this could harm our financial condition and operating results 

 

 the manufacturing processing formulation packaging labeling and advertising of our products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the federal trade commission “ftc” and the consumer product safety commission in addition our operations are subject to the oversight of the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold 

in particular the fda regulates the safety manufacturing labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits and overthecounter pharmaceuticals the fda also exercises a somewhat less rigorous oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition under a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of our other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that we use to manufacture regulated products and may observe compliance issues that would require us to make certain changes in our manufacturing facilities and processes it may be necessary to make additional expenditures to address these regulatory observations or possibly stop selling certain products until a compliance issue has been remediated as a result our business could be adversely affected 

our international operations including the production of overthecounter drug products are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which we manufacture or market goods changes in product standards or manufacturing requirements in any of these jurisdictions could require us to make certain modifications to our operations or product formulations or to cease manufacturing certain products completely as a result our international business could be adversely affected 

 

 our international operations subject us to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in all foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to 

  

repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the united states and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flow into us dollars outside the united states sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the euro british pound brazilian real canadian dollar mexican peso and australian dollar a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated may decrease operating profits and cash flow 

 

 we must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such chemicals due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

 we rely on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

the company operates in highly competitive consumer product markets in which cost efficiency new product offerings and innovation are critical to success the consumer products markets are particularly mature in north america and are characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to the company’s most significant product categories such as laundry detergents and oral care furthermore because of ongoing retail sector consolidation and the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from these customers particularly the highvolume retail store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to protect its existing market share or to capture additional market share the company increased expenditures for promotions and advertising and introduced new products and line extensions in order to fund the additional marketing expenses the company must sustain ongoing cost cutting initiatives furthermore through its acquisitions and cost improvement initiatives the company has been able to lower its overall unit costs and increase the productivity of its various manufacturing facilities 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses matters set forth in our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience our observation of trends in industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate our critical accounting policies include 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves 

most of the company’s revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered or picked up by our customers the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives such as coupons to consumers and sales incentives provided to customers such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly to customers all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company’s products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve 

  

requirements based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements an approximately 11 million difference in the reserve required for coupons would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns the company uses experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if the company’s estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to differ by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 60 million while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations during the twelve months ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 the company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately 45 million 81 million and 102 million respectively based on actual experience and updated information 

impairment of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets and property plant and equipment 

carrying values of goodwill trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the company’s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trademarks and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change distribution losses or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 

property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the company’s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the longlived assets are largely independent of other groups of company assets and liabilities the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology the continued success of product lines and future volume revenue and expense growth rates the company conducts annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when an impairment is indicated the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows 

in 2006 the company recognized tradename impairment and equipment obsolescence charges of approximately 168 million of which 127 million 38 million and 03 million were included in the operating results of the consumer domestic consumer international and spd segments respectively in 2005 the company recognized tradename equipment obsolescence and plant impairment charges of 187 million of which 78 million 77 million and 32 million were included in the consumer domestic consumer international and spd segments respectively in 2004 the company recognized tradename equipment obsolescence and plant impairment charges of approximately 67 million which were charged to the consumer domestic segment 

the estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated value of future cash flows and would have increased or decreased any impairment charge taken future outcomes may also differ if the company’s products fail to 

  

achieve estimated volume and pricing targets market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized then the company’s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 

inventory valuation 

when appropriate the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value including any costs to sell or dispose the company identifies any slow moving obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company’s products technological changes and new product introductions in addition the company’s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units “sku’s” excluding acquisitions the number of domestic sku’s has been reduced in half over the last 3 years the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required adjustments to the inventory’s net realizable value were 88 million at december 31 2006 and 58 million at december 31 2005 

valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs 

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 

the discount rate is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans and postretirement plans we refer to applicable indices such as the moody’s aa corporate bond index to select a rate at which we believe the pension benefits could be effectively settled based on the published rates as of december 31 2006 that matched our estimated cash flows for the plans the company used a discount rate of 575 for its three domestic plans the company’s weighted average discount rate as of december 31 2006 is 538 as compared to 536 used at december 31 2005 

the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans the asset mix of the plans and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation based on these factors the company’s weighted average expected longterm rate for the 2006 year is 680 a decline of 57 basis points from the 737 rate used at december 31 2005 this decrease is due principally to a decrease in expected returns in uk pension plans a 50 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return would result in less than a 05 million change in pension expense for 2007 

in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” the company recognized an additional minimum pension liability of 05 million included in longterm benefit obligations and recorded a charge net of tax to accumulated other comprehensive income which decreased stockholders’ equity the sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit and other postretirement plans” impact to the balance sheet was an increase to the 2006 pension and postretirement accrued benefit liabilities of 07 million and 28 million respectively the amounts were recorded net of tax directly to the ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income and not as a component of comprehensive income in accordance with the new standard 

the company made cash contributions of approximately 112 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2006 the company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately 92 million in 2007 

  

tax contingencies 

the company records liabilities in income taxes payable for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions the liabilities relate to tax return positions which although supportable by the company may be challenged by the tax authorities the company adjusts these liabilities as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the closing of the statute of limitations the company’s tax rate includes the impact of the liabilities and any changes to the liabilities settlement of any issue with the tax authorities would require the use of cash favorable resolution of an issue would be recognized as a reduction to the company’s annual tax rate

 consumer domestic 

2006 compared to 2005 

consumer domestic net sales were 13885 million in 2006 an increase of 1703 million or 140 as compared to 2005 the increase is primarily due to sales of spinbrush and ogi products these acquisitions contributed approximately 1550 million of incremental net sales the company assumed responsibility for all spinbrush sales and other functions in the us canada and the uk on april 1 2006 and recognized the gross amount of sales and expenses from the spinbrush business within the consolidated statement of earnings for the us and most foreign locations during the second quarter during the transition period prior to april 1 2006 when the seller of the spinbrush business maintained these responsibilities the company accounted for the net cash received as other revenue sales of the segment’s preexisting product lines increased slightly as a result of higher prices partially offset by slightly lower volume effective february 1 2006 the company implemented price increases ranging from 4 to over 10 for products representing about 35 of its us consumer products portfolio’s net sales these products include arm  hammer and xtra liquid laundry detergents arm  hammer super scoop cat litter and arm  hammer baking soda management believes the price increase caused the company to experience lower product demand as consumers adjusted to the higher prices however management believes that these price increases have improved the company’s margins and contributed to achieving its financial goals higher sales also reflected growth in liquid laundry detergents pregnancy kits and pet care and the reduction of promotion reserves of 27 million based on updated information including actual experience partially offset by lower toothpaste and deodorant sales 

  

consumer domestic income before minority interest and income taxes was 1665 million in 2006 a 238 million increase as compared to 2005 the increase is primarily due to the contributions from ogi and spinbrush products and the effect of higher gross margins for liquid laundry detergents the higher profitability was partially offset by higher oilbased manufacturing and freight costs and higher sga expenses primarily stock option expense higher personnel related expenses higher research and development costs higher legal and professional fees and costs associated with the ogi and spinbrush businesses the segment’s profitability was also negatively impacted by tradename and equipment obsolescence charges of 135 million in 2006 and an increase in intangible assets amortization and higher allocated interest expense 

2005 compared to 2004 

consumer domestic net sales increased 1411 million or 131 to 12182 million in 2005 personal care products increased 1079 million primarily due to sales associated with the domestic results of the former armkel products of 1023 million for the five months ended may 27 2005 higher sales of condoms and diagnostic kits and sales associated with elexa partially offset by lower oral care product sales household product sales increased 332 million or 49 due to higher sales of arm  hammer and xtra liquid laundry products and arm  hammer super scoop cat litter partially offset by lower sales of powdered laundry detergent among other increases included in the segment’s results is 68 million associated with the reduction of promotion reserves due to a change in estimate in an effort to reduce the impact of higher raw and packaging costs the company implemented price increases during the latter part of 2004 and 2005 for consumer domestic products that generated approximately 20 of consumer domestic’s sales volume during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company announced price increases ranging from 4 to over 10 for products representing about 35 of its us consumer products portfolio effective february 1 2006 the products affected include arm  hammer and xtra liquid laundry detergents arm  hammer super scoop cat litter and arm  hammer baking soda due to the timing of previously agreed promotional events the full benefit of the price increase was not realized until the second quarter of 2006 

consumer domestic income before taxes and minority interest increased 300 million to 1427 million this is primarily due to the increased contribution from the former armkel products for the entire year the profit impact resulting from higher sales of liquid laundry detergent trojan first response and cat litter products lower marketing expenses for certain personal care products lower performance based compensation costs and lower interest expense in 2004 interest expense reflected the segment’s allocation of the interest expense portion of the settlement of the appraisal action brought by former carterwallace shareholders in addition 2004 results reflected impairment charges of 67 million and a 105 million inventory stepup charge the increased profitability was partially offset by higher manufacturing and freight costs in 2005 resulting from higher oil and natural gas prices due in part to hurricanes katrina and rita which the company estimated to be 60 million these cost increases were partially offset by the effect of substantial cost improvements as well as price increases for about 20 of the segment’s products in terms of net sales volume which were implemented during 2005 the segment’s profitability was also negatively impacted by tradename and plant impairment and obsolescence charges of 78 million and an increase in intangible assets amortization

consumer international net sales were 3369 million in 2006 an increase of 396 million or 133 as compared to 2005 the 2006 net sales reflect 257 million associated with the ogi and spinbrush products and the skin care product acquired late in 2005 favorable exchange rates of 69 million and the reduction of promotion reserves of 18 million based on updated information including actual experience other products in the segment experienced slight volume and pricing gains strong sales in canada uk and australia were offset by lower sales of certain skin care brands in europe 

consumer international income before minority interest and income taxes was 253 million in 2006 an increase of 110 million as compared to 2005 the increase is a result of the contribution from the products of

accounts receivable increased by 143 million in 2006 as compared to fiscal year end 2005 this increase was largely due to the company’s strong fourth quarter net sales which were 22 higher than the fourth quarter 

  

of 2005 this is primarily associated with the ogi and spinbrush acquisitions in 2005 accounts receivable increased by 284 million as compared to fiscal year end 2004 that increase was largely due to the company’s strong fourth quarter net sales which were 65 higher than the fourth quarter of 2004 accounts receivable in 2004 decreased 427 million as compared to 2003 due to the impact of the armkel acquisition which had higher than average accounts receivable on the date of acquisition 

inventories increased in 2006 by 388 million due to the ogi and spinbrush acquisitions inventories increased in 2005 by 98 million due to the impact of higher raw and packaging costs experienced in 2005 inventory in support of the new elexa brand and the need to support higher sales inventories declined in 2004 by 49 million reflecting lower raw material inventories 

the net decrease of 62 million in accounts payable taxes payable and other liabilities in 2006 is related to the timing of payments related to increased payables at december 31 2005 the net increase of 343 million in accounts payable taxes payable and other liabilities in 2005 includes the additional reserve recorded in connection with the andes litigation of 83 million and the timing of tax payments the increase in 2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily related to higher accrued employee compensation costs and higher sales promotion accruals

the company entered into two cash flow hedge agreements one effective as of september 29 2006 and the other effective as of december 29 2006 to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its tranche a term loan debt each hedge covers 1000 million of zerocost collars for 5 and 3 years respectively with a cap of 650 and a floor of 357 there was no income statement impact as a result of these agreements as all changes in the hedging option’s fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet

amended and increased to allow for the 2500 million the company needed to fund the ogi acquisition the obligations of the company under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries those domestic subsidiaries have also guaranteed the loan obligations under the credit agreement certain of the covenants in the amended and restated credit agreement were also modified the term loan and the revolving loans bear interest under one of two rate options selected by the company equal to a either i a eurocurrency rate adjusted for any reserve requirements “eurocurrency rate” or ii the greater of the prime rate the secondary market rate for threemonth certificates of deposit adjusted for any reserve requirements plus the applicable fdic assessment rate plus 10 or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 “alternate base rate” plus b an applicable margin on the closing date of the new agreement the applicable margin was a 100 for the eurocurrency rate and b 0 for the alternate rate the term loan was used to refinance the company’s term loan b and the revolving loans are available for general corporate purposes 

adjusted ebitda is a required component of the financial covenants contained in the company’s primary credit facility and senior subordinated notes management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda is useful to investors as a financial indicator of the company’s ability to service its indebtedness adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states financial covenants include a total debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio which if not met could result in an event of default and trigger the early termination of the credit facility and notes if not remedied within a certain period of time the definition of adjusted ebitda in the notes is substantially similar to the definition in the credit agreement 

adjusted ebitda was approximately 3481 million for 2006 the leverage ratio total debt to adjusted ebitda for 2006 was 270 versus the credit agreement’s maximum of 400 and the interest coverage ratio adjusted ebitda to total interest expense was 644 versus the agreement’s minimum of 30 the credit agreement is secured by the assets of the company and certain domestic subsidiaries the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted ebitda is as follows in millions

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risks and uncertainties as well as others described elsewhere in this report could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

 we have recently introduced new consumer products such as elexa sexual health products and trojan mint tingle condoms and line extensions to laundry toothpaste and depilatory brands the development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development and marketing expenditures which we may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of our existing products our financial performance could be harmed 

 

 in the past we have discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shutdown costs we may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand product returns writeoffs or shutdown costs would reduce cash flow and earnings product efficacy or safety concerns could result in product recalls or declining sales  which would reduce our cash flow and earnings 

 

 during 2005 approximately 78 of our sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers and household cleaning products toothpastes and antiperspirants and deodorants our unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of our products by consumers product innovation and our ability to capture market share from competitors we may not succeed in implementing strategies to increase domestic revenues 

the consumer products industry particularly the laundry detergent personal care and air deodorizer categories is intensely competitive to protect existing market share or to capture increased market share we may need to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and introduce and establish new products increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing market share and could result in lower sales and profits many of our competitors including the procter  gamble company unilever inc the clorox company colgatepalmolive company henkel ssl industries reckitt benkiser pfizer and sc johnson  son inc are substantially larger companies that have greater financial resources than we do these competitors have the capacity to outspend us should they attempt to gain market share if we lose market share and the markets in which we compete do not grow our sales levels and operating results would decline 

 

 consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced like many of our products are subject to significant price competition and in recent years have been characterized by price deflation from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and 

  

to maintain market share any reduction in prices to respond to these pressures would harm profit margins in addition if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins our results of operations would suffer 

because of the competitive environment facing retailers many of our trade customers particularly our highvolume retail store customers have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms our margins are reduced further if we are unable to maintain terms that are acceptable to our trade customers these trade customers could reduce purchases of our products and increase purchases of products from our competitors which would harm our sales and profitability 

 

 from time to time our retail customers have reduced inventory levels in managing their working capital requirements any reduction in inventory levels by our retail customers would harm our operating results for the financial periods affected by the reductions in particular continued consolidation within the retail industry could potentially reduce inventory levels maintained by our retail customers which could adversely affect our results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions 

 

 our performance also depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and by the financial difficulties of retailers industry wide consumer products such as those marketed by us are increasingly being sold by club stores and mass merchandisers while sales of consumer products by food and drug stores are comprising a smaller proportion of the total volume of consumer products sold sales of our products are stronger in the food and drug channels of trade and not as strong with the club stores and mass merchandisers although we have taken steps to improve sales by club stores and mass merchandisers if we are not successful in improving sales to these channels and the current trend continues our financial condition and operating results could suffer 

 

 walmart including its affiliate sam’s club is our largest customer accounting for approximately 18 of net sales in 2005 18 of net sales in 2004 and 17 of net sales in 2003 our top three customers accounted for approximately 25 of net sales in 2005 26 of net sales in 2004 and 26 of net sales in 2003 the loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by walmart or any of our other top customers would harm our sales and profitability 

 

 we have made several acquisitions in the past few years including the acquisition of a skin care brand in south america the spinbrush batteryoperated toothbrush brand unilever’s oral care brands in the united states and canada and some of the consumer products businesses of carterwallace inc which was completed through the acquisition of armkel and may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future any future acquisitions or investments would entail various risks including the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of our ongoing business and generally our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment the risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent acquisitions are made with businesses or operations outside of the united states and 

  

canada such as the acquisition of the skin care brand in south america and the spinbrush business for which products are manufactured by third party contract manufacturers in china these factors could harm our financial condition and operating results any future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the issuance of new equity by us and the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not they are ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and divert other resources from other matters that are critical to our operations 

 

 our distribution of condoms under the trojan and other trademarks is regulated by the us food and drug administration fda certain of our condoms contain the spermicide nonoxynol9 n9 the world health organization and other interested groups have issued reports suggesting that n9 should not be used rectally or for multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse given the ingredient’s potential to cause irritation to human membranes fda has recently issued nonbinding draft guidance concerning the labeling of condoms in general and those with n9 in particular we have filed a response recommending alternative labeling with the fda we believe that our present labeling for condoms with n9 is compliant with the overall objectives of the draft guidance and that condoms with n9 will remain a viable contraceptive choice for those couples who wish to use them however we cannot predict the nature of the labeling that ultimately will be required by the fda while awaiting further fda guidance we have implemented an interim label statement change cautioning against rectal use and morethanonceaday vaginal use of condoms with n9 and have launched a public information campaign to communicate these messages to the affected communities 

if the fda or state governments eventually promulgate rules which prohibit or restrict the use of n9 in condoms such as new or additional labeling requirements we could incur further costs from obsolete products packaging or raw materials and sales of condoms could decline which in turn could decrease our operating income 

 

 increases in the prices of raw materials such as surfactants which are cleaning agents paper products and bottles or increases in energy costs could significantly affect our profit margins in particular during 2005 we experienced extraordinary price increases for raw and packaging materials diesel fuel and energy costs particularly as a result of strong demand from china and supply interruptions caused by hurricanes katrina and rita we use surfactants and bottles in the manufacture and marketing of laundry and household cleaning products such as arm  hammer and xtra laundry detergents and scrub free and clean shower bathroom cleaners we use paper products for packaging in many of our consumer and specialty chemical products we have attempted to address these price increases through costs reduction programs and price increases of our own products if price increases continue to occur we may not be able to increase the prices of our products to fully offset these increases this could harm our financial condition and operating results 

 

 the manufacturing processing formulation packaging labeling and advertising of our products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the federal trade commission or ftc and the consumer product safety commission in addition our operations are subject to the oversight of the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board our activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold 

in particular the fda regulates the safety manufacturing labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits and overthecounter pharmaceuticals the fda also exercises a somewhat 

  

less rigorous oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of our other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that we use to manufacture regulated products and may observe compliance issues that would require us to make certain changes in our manufacturing facilities and processes it may be necessary to make additional expenditures to address these regulatory observations or possibly stop selling certain products until a compliance issue has been remediated as a result our business could be adversely affected 

our international operations including the production of overthecounter drug products are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which we manufacture or market goods changes in product standards or manufacturing requirements in any of these jurisdictions could require us to make certain modifications to our operations or product formulations or to cease manufacturing certain products completely as a result our business could be adversely affected 

 

 in 2004 we acquired the remaining 50 ownership interest in armkel that we did not already own increasing the scope of our foreign operations these operations subject us to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in all foreign jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the united states and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flow into us dollars outside the united states sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the euro british pound brazilian real canadian dollar mexican peso and australian dollar a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated may decrease operating profits and cash flow 

 

 we must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such chemicals due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition 

  

 we rely on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions we cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

 as of december 31 2005 we had 7565 million of total consolidated indebtedness this level of indebtedness could i limit our ability to borrow money to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and debt service requirements and other financing needs and ii make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business industry or the economy in general in the event of a general increase in interest rates our interest expense would increase because a substantial portion of the indebtedness including all of the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities bears interest at floating rates our failure to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the terms of our subordinated notes and agreement relating to our credit facility place a limit on the amount of certain cash payments we can make this limitation includes the amount we can pay in dividends on our common stock as long as we are not in default under either agreement we do not anticipate that the limitation will have an effect on our ability to pay dividends at the current rate

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” 

overview 

the company develops manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer and specialty products it recognizes revenues and profits from selling its products under a variety of brands including arm  hammer and trojan to consumers through supermarkets drug stores and mass merchandisers and to industrial customers and distributors on may 28 2004 the company acquired the joint venture interest in armkel owned by affiliates of kelso  company and armkel was merged into the company this is sometimes referred as “the armkel acquisition” the discussion of results of operations of armkel are reflected in the results of operations since the acquisition on may 28 2004 

the company operates in three primary segments consumer domestic consumer international and specialty products our consumer domestic segment includes household products for deodorizing such as arm  hammer baking soda and cat litter products laundry and cleaning such as xtra and arm  hammer laundry detergents scrub free and brillo cleaning products and personal care products such as trojan condoms nair depilatories and waxes first response and answer home pregnancy and ovulation test kits arrid antiperspirant and arm  hammer mentadent closeup pepsodent and aim toothpastes our consumer international segment sells a variety of personal care products some of which use the same brands as our domestic product lines in international markets including france the united kingdom canada mexico australia brazil and spain our specialty products “spd” segment is the largest us producer of sodium bicarbonate which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial institutional medical and food applications this segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products for the twelve months ended december 31 2005 our consumer domestic consumer international and specialty products segments represented approximately 70 17 and 13 respectively of net sales 

for the three year period ended december 31 2005 the company’s earnings per share has grown at an average rate of 195 its sales has increased from 10471 million in 2002 to 17365 million in 2005 and its income from operations has increased from 1045 million in 2002 to 2128 million in 2005 these increases principally reflect the armkel and unilever oral care business acquisitions 

during 2005 the company continued to experience extraordinary price increases for raw and packaging materials diesel fuel and energy costs partially as a result of strong demand from china and supply interruptions caused by hurricanes katrina and rita the hurricanes devastating damage to oil and chemical production facilities in the gulf region resulted in widespread shortages while the company was able to identify alternative supply sources at much higher costs and maintain normal service levels it was able to partially offset these higher costs through cost improvement programs and pricing actions taken over the last twelve months the company expects these increases to have some residual impact on its operations during the first half of 2006 

the company operates in highly competitive consumer product markets in which cost efficiency new product offerings and innovation are critical to success the consumer products markets are particularly mature in north america and are characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to the company’s most significant product categories such as laundry detergents and oral care furthermore because of ongoing retail sector consolidation and the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from these customers particularly the highvolume retail store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to protect its existing market share or to capture increased market share the company had to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and to introduce and establish new products consequently the need for ongoing cost cutting initiatives needs to be sustained as new product introductions or product line extensions remain the most viable path to generating organic topline growth given the mature nature of most product categories in north american markets through its acquisitions the company has been able to lower its overall unit costs and increase the productivity of its various manufacturing facilities this has resulted in higher levels of cash flow 

  

recent acquisitions 

on october 31 2005 the company closed on its previously announced acquisition of the spinbrush toothbrush business from the procter  gamble company “pg” the company paid 750 million in cash at closing the company will purchase the inventory following a transition period which is expected to be completed by mid 2006 and may make additional cash payments of up to 300 million based on the nearterm performance of the business the acquisition was funded out of the company’s available cash an independent appraisal of the assets acquired is in process the financial statements included in this report reflect a preliminary allocation which assigns a significant amount of the purchase price to intangible assets during the transition period while pg continues to provide significant services the company is accounting for the net cash received from pg as other revenue the company expects to complete the transition process by mid 2006 

during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company acquired a small skin care business in south america the company paid approximately 43 million which was allocated to intangible assets the results since the acquisition are included in the consumer international segment 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses matters set forth in our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience our observance of trends in industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate our critical accounting policies include 

revenue recognition and promotional and sales returns reserves 

most of the company’s revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered to or picked up by our customer the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers such as coupons and sales incentives made to vendors such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the related sale is recognized coop advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company’s products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product is sold relating to the promotion the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of coupons redeemed over the past couple of years if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 01 from the rate accrued for in the financial statements an approximately 09 million difference in the reserve required would result with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns the company uses experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if the company’s estimates for vendor promotional activities and sales returns were to differ by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 5 million while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgements have been made estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations during the twelve months ended december 31 2005 the company reversed promotion liabilities of approximately 81 million based on changes to previous estimates and in 2004 and 2003 the company reversed promotion liabilities of approximately 102 million and 13 million respectively 

  

impairment of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets and property plant and equipment 

carrying values of goodwill trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the company’s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trademarks and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 

property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the company’s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology the continued success of product lines and future volume revenue and expense growth rates the company conducts annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when an impairment is indicated the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows 

in 2005 the company recognized tradename impairment plant impairment and restructuring and equipment obsolescence charges of approximately 187 million of which 78 million 77 million and 32 million were included in the operating results of the consumer domestic consumer international and spd segments respectively in 2004 the company recognized tradename equipment obsolescence and plant impairment charges of 67 million which were charged to the consumer domestic segment in 2003 the company recognized tradename equipment obsolescence and plant impairment charges of approximately 27 million which were charged to the consumer domestic segment 

the estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated value of future cash flows and would have increased or decreased any impairment charge taken future outcomes may also differ if the company’s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized then the company’s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 

inventory valuation 

when appropriate the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value including any costs to sell or dispose the company identifies any slow moving obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company’s products technological changes and new product introductions in addition the company’s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units “sku’s” the number of domestic sku’s has been reduced by approximately 46 over the last 2 years to minimize this risk the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required adjustments to the inventory’s net realizable value were 58 million at december 31 2005 and 59 million at december 31 2004 

  

valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs 

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to our actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 

the discount rate is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans and postretirement plans we refer to applicable indices such as standard  poors or the moody’s aa corporate bond index to select a rate at which we believe the pension benefits could be effectively settled based on the published rates as of december 31 2005 as well as selected corporate bonds matching our estimated cash flows of the plans the company used a discount rate of 575 for its three domestic plans the discount rate used in 2005 is the same as the december 31 2004 rate used for the domestic plans the company’s weighted average discount rate as of december 31 2005 is 536 as compared to 558 used at december 31 2004 all foreign subsidiaries lowered their discount rate at december 31 2005 

the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans the asset mix of the plans and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation based on these factors the company’s weighted average expected longterm rate of return as of december 31 2005 is 737 a decline of 24 basis points from the 761 rate used at december 31 2004 this decrease is due to the change in the expected longterm rate of the company’s domestic plans from 825 to 775 a 50 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return would result in less than a 05 million change in pension expense for 2006 

in accordance with sfas no 87 the company recognized an additional minimum pension liability of 03 million in 2005 and recorded a charge net of tax to accumulated other comprehensive loss of 02 million which decreased stockholders’ equity the charge to stockholders’ equity for the excess of additional pension liability represents a net loss not yet recognized as pension expense 

the company made cash contributions of approximately 53 million to certain of its pension plans in 2005 the company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately 54 million in 2006 

tax contingencies 

the company records liabilities in income taxes payable for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions the liabilities relate to tax return positions which although supportable by the company may be challenged by the tax authorities the company adjusts these liabilities as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the closing of the statute of limitations the company’s tax rate includes the impact of the liabilities and any changes to the liabilities settlement of any issue with the tax authorities would require the use of cash favorable resolution of an issue would be recognized as a reduction to the company’s annual tax rate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 which requires recognition of an expense when goods or services are provided sfas no 123r requires the determination of the fair value of the sharebased compensation at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which the sharebased compensation vests sfas no 123r permits a modified prospective or retrospective transition method under the retrospective method financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by the original sfas no 123 the company adopted the provisions of sfas 

  

no 123r effective january 1 2006 and will begin recognizing an expense for unvested sharebased instruments that has been issued or will be issued after that date the company has decided to apply the modified prospective method of adoption and anticipates the effect on diluted earnings per share to be approximately 008 in 2006 under this method compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under statement 123 for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 

the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “ajca” was enacted on october 22 2004 the ajca repeals an export incentive creates a new deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities and includes a special onetime deduction of 85 of certain foreign earnings repatriated to the us the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1091 “application of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004” fsp fas 1091 on december 21 2004 in accordance with fsp fas 1091 the company treats the deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities which became effective for the company beginning january 1 2005 as a reduction of the income tax provision in future years as realized in december 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” allowing companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the ajca on plans for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings the company has decided not to repatriate any of its foreign earnings under the ajca 

fasb interpretation no 47 “fin no 47” “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 was issued in march 2005 and is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 fin no 47 provides clarification with respect to the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets when the timing andor method of settlement of the obligation is conditional on a future event fin no 47 requires that the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it occurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made the adoption of fin no 47 did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations in 2005 

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level presented below is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment the discussion of our segment operating results is presented on a historical basis for the years ending december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 the segment discussion also addresses certain product line information the company’s reporting units are consistent with its reportable segments 

consolidated results 

2005 compared to 2004 

net sales 

net sales increased by 2744 million or 188 to 17365 million compared to 14621 million in 2004 the increase was largely due to the may 2004 armkel acquisition which contributed sales through may 27 2005 of 2081 million in 2005 also contributing to the increase was the reversal of promotion reserves of 81 million and favorable foreign exchange rates of 40 million effective price increases on certain domestic products and the third quarter introduction of elexa a premium line of sexual health products for women contributed to the higher sales late in 2005 the company purchased the spinbrush toothbrush business from pg as noted earlier the company is accounting for the net cash received during the transition period as other revenue which amounted to an immaterial amount for the year 

  

operating costs 

the company’s gross margin of 367 was virtually unchanged as compared to the 365 gross margin in 2004 the 2005 gross margin was affected by a 64 million charge associated with the closure of a subscale consumer products manufacturing operation abroad and plant impairment and equipment obsolescence charges of 78 million the gross margin was also impacted by higher commodity costs particularly for oilbased raw and packaging materials used in household and specialty products businesses partially offset by the effect of cost improvement programs and pricing actions which the company has implemented over the past year and the previously mentioned reversal of promotion reserves gross margin was positively impacted by the full year effect of the armkel acquisition whose brands carry a higher gross margin than the company’s existing product lines prior to the acquisition the 2004 gross margin was affected by a 105 million inventory related purchase accounting charge associated with the armkel acquisition and 48 million in plant obsolescence and impairment charges 

marketing expenses of 1834 million increased 222 million or 138 from 2004 reflecting 280 million associated with the acquired armkel brands during the first five months of 2005 expenses for the introduction of elexa were more than offset by lower expenses for certain other personal care and laundry and cleaning products 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” of 2408 million increased 404 million or 201 as compared to 2004 costs associated with the former armkel business for the five months ended may 27 2005 were approximately 380 million included in the current year sga expenses are tradename impairment charges of 63 million and an 83 million charge related to litigation involving andes trading de mexico sa the “andes litigation” for a further explanation please refer to item “c” in footnote 16 commitments contingencies and guarantees other sga costs decreased in 2005 due to lower deferred and performance based compensation costs of approximately 30 million and lower sarbanesoxley act related expenses of 22 million included in 2004’s sga is 4 million of severance costs and the termination costs relating to a foreign subsidiary’s pension plan and a 19 million tradename impairment charge 

other income and expenses 

the decrease in equity in earnings of affiliates of 103 million reflects the consolidation of the former armkel business since the may 28 2004 acquisition date included in the company’s equity earnings from armkel in 2004 is a 25 million tradename impairment charge the combined results of the company’s other equity investments armand products company “armand” and the armakleen company “armakleen” increased by 05 million 

interest expense of 441 million was 27 million higher than 2004 the increase can be attributed primarily to increased debt that was assumed by the company as part of the armkel acquisition and the full year effect of new debt required to purchase the remaining interest in armkel included in 2004’s interest expense was 49 million associated with the company’s settlement of an appraisal action brought by former carterwallace shareholders and an indemnification arrangement involving armkel and the company which acquired carterwallace’s consumer products business in 2001 

net loss on early extinguishment of debt of 12 million is associated with the fourth quarter refinancing of the company’s term loan in 2004 the company incurred charges of 229 million including an 80 million charge associated with the company’s bank debt refinancing to effect the acquisition of armkel and a 149 million charge related to the redemption of the armkel 9 1  2  senior subordinated notes due 2009 assumed as part of the armkel acquisition

consumer international 

2005 compared to 2004 

consumer international net sales increased 1205 million or 682 to 2973 million for the year this is primarily due to 1058 million of sales associated with the former armkel international business during the five months ended may 27 2005 and 42 million relating to favorable foreign exchange rates the balance of the increase is primarily due to growth in canada which saw stronger sales of household products england which had higher sales of test kits and skin care products and brazil as a result of the skin care product acquired in late 2005 also included in the segment’s results was 13 million associated with the reduction of promotion reserves due to a change in estimate 

income before taxes and minority interest for the year was 143 million a reduction of 10 million as compared to last year while 2005 results benefited from the inclusion of the former armkel business for the five month period ended may 28 2005 this was more than offset by tradename impairment charges of 30 million and the charge for the andes litigation and higher marketing expenses for a further explanation of the andes litigation please refer to item “c” in footnote 16 commitments contingencies and guarantees during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company recorded a 64 million restructuring charge which includes both severance and asset impairment charges associated with the closure of a consumer packaged goods plant at one of its international locations the prior year was negatively impacted by a 16 million inventory stepup charge

 net cash provided by operations —the company’s net cash provided by operations decreased 89 million to 1901 million in 2005 the decrease in net cash provided by operations was due primarily to an increase in working capital exclusive of cash and cash equivalents and other liabilities of 49 million in 2005 while in 2004 these items decreased by 633 million from 2003 the impact of the increase in working capital was partially offset by higher operating income before noncash charges for depreciation amortization plant obsolescence restructuring and impairment charges 

for the year ended december 31 2005 the components of working capital impacted operating cash flow as follows 

accounts receivable increased by 284 million as compared to fiscal year end 2004 this increase was largely due to the company’s strong fourth quarter net sales which were 65 higher than the fourth quarter of 2004 accounts receivable in 2004 decreased 427 million as compared to 2003 due to the impact of the armkel acquisition which had higher than average accounts receivable on the date of acquisition 

inventories increased in 2005 by 98 million due to the impact of higher raw and packaging costs experienced in 2005 inventory in support of the new elexa brand and the need to support higher sales inventories declined in 2004 by 49 million reflecting lower raw material inventories 

the net increase of 343 million in accounts payable taxes payable and other liabilities includes the additional reserve recorded in connection with the andes litigation of 83 million and the timing of tax payments the increase in 2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily related to higher accrued employee compensation costs and higher sales promotion accruals

on december 23 2005 the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the “credit agreement” with a number of banks and other financial institutions this amended and restated credit agreement provides for a five year term loan a in a principal amount of 3000 million and may be increased by up to an additional 2500 million through an accordion feature upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and continues the existing five year multicurrency revolving credit and letter of credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 1000 million the obligations of the company under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries those domestic subsidiaries have also guaranteed the loan obligations under the credit agreement certain of the covenants in the amended and restated credit agreement were also modified the term loan and the revolving loans bear interest under one of two rate options selected by the company equal to a either i a eurocurrency rate adjusted for any reserve requirements “eurocurrency rate” or ii the greater of the prime rate the secondary market rate for threemonth certificates of deposit adjusted for any reserve requirements plus the applicable fdic assessment rate plus 10 or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 “alternate base rate” plus b an applicable margin on the closing date of the new agreement the applicable margin was a 100 for the eurocurrency rate and b 0 for the alternate rate the term loan was used to refinance the company’s term loan b and the revolving loans are available for general corporate purposes 

adjusted ebitda is a required component of the financial covenants contained in the company’s primary credit facility and senior subordinated notes management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda is useful to investors as a financial indicator of the company’s ability to service its indebtedness adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states financial covenants include a total debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio which if not met could result in an event of default and trigger the early termination of the credit facility and notes if not remedied within a certain period of time the definition of adjusted ebitda in the notes is not materially different than that of the credit agreement 

adjusted ebitda was approximately 2884 million for 2005 the leverage ratio total debt to adjusted ebitda for 2005 was 259 versus the credit agreement’s maximum of 425 which will be in effect as of march 31 2006 and the interest coverage ratio adjusted ebitda to total interest expense was 654 versus the agreement’s minimum of 30 this credit agreement is secured by the assets of the company and certain domestic subsidiaries the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted ebitda is as follows in millions

the table above reflects consolidated net sales exclusive of unconsolidated entities segment information that includes unconsolidated entities is contained in note 17 of the company’s consolidated financial statements included in this report  

  

risk factors 

  

the following risks and uncertainties as well as others described in this annual report on form 10k could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

  

   

the company has recently introduced a number of new consumer products such as arm  hammer enamel care toothpastes trojan mint tingle condoms arm  hammer multicat cat litter and line extensions to its nair depilatory brand the development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition if the new products merely cause sales of the company’s existing products to decline the financial performance of the company could be harmed 

  

   

in the past the company has discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shut down costs the company may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent it discontinues products that do not meet expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand product returns writeoffs or shut down costs would reduce cash flow and earnings product efficacy or safety concerns could result in product recalls or declining sales which would reduce cash flow and earnings 

  

   

during 2004 approximately 83 of the company’s sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to the company’s most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers and household cleaning products toothpastes and antipersipirants and deodorants the company’s unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of its products by consumers product innovation and its ability to capture market share from competitors the company may not succeed in implementing its strategies to increase domestic revenues 

  

the consumer products industry particularly the laundry detergent personal care and air deodorizer categories is intensely competitive to protect its existing market share or to capture increased market share the company may need to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and introduce and establish new products increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing market share and could result in lower sales and profits many of the company’s competitors including the procter  gamble company unilever inc the clorox company colgatepalmolive company gillette co henkel ssl industries reckitt benkiser pfizer and sc johnson  son inc are substantially larger companies that have greater financial resources than the company has these competitors have the capacity to outspend the company should they attempt to gain market share in addition if the company loses market share and the markets in which it competes do not grow the company’s sales levels and operating results would decline 

  

   

consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced like many of the company’s products are subject to significant price competition and in recent years have been characterized by price deflation from time to time the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices to respond to these pressures would harm profit margins in addition if the company’s sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins its results of operations would suffer 

  

because of the competitive environment facing retailers many of the company’s trade customers particularly its highvolume retail store customers have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to the extent the company provides concessions or better trade terms its margins are reduced further if the company is unable to maintain terms that are acceptable to its trade customers these trade customers could reduce purchases of the company’s products and increase purchases of products from its competitors which would harm the company’s sales and profitability 

  

   

from time to time the company’s retail customers have reduced inventory levels in managing their working capital requirements any reduction in inventory levels by the company’s retail customers would harm its operating results for the financial periods affected by the reductions in particular continued consolidation within the retail industry could potentially reduce inventory levels maintained by the company’s retail customers which could adversely affect its results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions 

  

   

the company’s performance also depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and by the financial difficulties of retailers industry wide consumer products such as those marketed by the company are increasingly being sold in club stores and mass merchandisers while sales of consumer products by food and drug stores are comprising a smaller proportion of the total volume of consumer products sold sales of the company’s products are stronger in the food and drug channels of trade and not as strong with the club stores and mass merchandisers although the company has taken steps to improve sales in club stores and mass merchandisers if it is not successful in improving sales to these channels and the current trend continues the company’s financial condition and operating results could suffer 

  

   

walmart including its affiliate sam’s club is the company’s largest customer accounting for approximately 18 of net sales in 2004 17 of net sales in 2003 and 16 of net sales in 2002 the company’s top three customers accounted for approximately 26 of net sales in 2004 26 of net sales in 2003 and 23 of net sales in 2002 the loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by walmart or any of the company’s other top customers would harm the company’s sales and profitability 

  

   

the company has made several acquisitions in the past few years including the acquisition of usa detergents inc biovance technologies inc unilever’s oral care brands in the united states and canada and some of the consumer products businesses of carterwallace inc which was completed through the acquisition of armkel and may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future any future acquisitions or investments would entail various risks including the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of the company’s ongoing business and generally the company’s potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment these factors could harm the company’s financial condition and operating results any future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the issuance of new equity in the company and the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not they are ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and divert other resources from other matters that are critical to the company’s operations 

  

   

the company’s distribution of condoms under the trojan and other trademarks is regulated by the us food and drug administration fda certain of the company’s condoms contain the spermicide nonoxynol9 n9 the world health organization and other interested groups have issued reports suggesting that n9 should not be used 

  

rectally or for multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse given the ingredient’s potential to cause irritation to human membranes the company expects the fda to issue nonbinding draft guidance concerning the labeling of condoms with n9 although the timing of such draft guidance is uncertain the company believes that condoms with n9 provide an acceptable added means of contraceptive protection and it is cooperating with the fda concerning the appropriate labeling revisions if any however the company cannot predict the outcome of the fda review while labeling guidance from the fda is pending the company has implemented an interim label statement change cautioning against rectal use and multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse 

  

if the fda or state governments take action that prohibit or restrict the use of n9 in condoms such as new labeling requirements the company could incur further costs from obsolete products packaging or raw materials and sales of condoms could decline which in turn could decrease the company’s operating income 

  

   

increases in the prices of raw materials such as surfactants which are cleaning agents paper products and bottles or increases in energy costs could significantly affect the company’s profit margins the company uses surfactants and bottles in the manufacture and marketing of laundry and household cleaning products such as arm  hammer and xtra laundry detergents and scrub free and clean shower bathroom cleaners the company uses paper products for packaging in many of its consumer and specialty chemical products if price increases were to occur the company may not be able to increase the prices of its products to offset these increases this could harm the company’s financial condition and operating results 

  

   

the manufacturing processing formulation packaging labeling and advertising of the company’s products are subject to regulation by federal agencies including the fda the federal trade commission or ftc and the consumer product safety commission in addition the company’s operations are subject to the oversight of the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration and the national labor relations board the company’s activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states localities and foreign countries in which the company’s products are sold 

  

in particular the fda regulates the safety manufacturing labeling and distribution of condoms home pregnancy and ovulation test kits and overthecounter pharmaceuticals the fda also exercises a somewhat less rigorous oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories in addition pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the fda and the ftc the ftc has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products and the ftc regulates the promotion and advertising of the company’s other products as well as part of its regulatory authority the fda may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities machinery processes and procedures that the company uses to manufacture regulated products and may observe compliance issues that would require the company to make certain changes in the company’s manufacturing facilities and processes it may be necessary to make additional expenditures to comply with these regulatory observations or possibly stop selling certain products until a condition has been remediated as a result the company’s business could be adversely affected 

  

the company’s international operations including the production of overthecounter drug products are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which the company manufactures or markets goods changes in product standards or manufacturing requirements in any of these jurisdictions could require the company to make certain modifications to its operations or product formulations or to cease manufacturing certain products completely as a result the company’s business could be adversely affected 

  

   

in may 2004 the company acquired the remaining 50 ownership interest in armkel that the company did not already own increasing the scope of the company’s foreign operations these operations subject the company to risks customarily associated with foreign operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

in all foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates the company is subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit the company’s ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the united states and may limit the company’s ability to convert foreign currency cash flow into us dollars outside the united states sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies including the euro british pound brazilian real canadian dollar mexican peso and australian dollar a weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated may decrease operating profits and cash flow 

  

   

the company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances a release of such chemicals due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties the company has incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations it is possible that the company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect to the results of operations or financial condition 

  

   

the company relies on trademark trade secret patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property rights the company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted there is a risk that the company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or where appropriate license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions the company cannot be sure that these rights if obtained will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in the future in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which the company’s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the company’s failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make the company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition of the company 

  

   

as of december 31 2004 the company had 8587 million of total consolidated indebtedness this level of indebtedness could i limit the company’s ability to borrow money to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and debt service requirements and other financing needs and ii make the company more vulnerable to a downturn in its business industry or the economy in general in the event of a general increase in interest rates the company’s interest expense would increase because a substantial portion of the indebtedness including all of the indebtedness under the company’s senior credit facilities bears interest at floating rates the company’s failure to service its indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition of the company the terms of the subordinated note and credit agreement place a limit on the amount of certain cash payments the company can make this limitation includes the amount the company can pay in dividends on its common stock as long as the company is not in default under either agreement the limitation  which is a percent of net income relative to the company’s consolidated leverage ratio is such that the company does not currently anticipate having an effect on the its ability to pay dividends at its current rate

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” 

  

overview 

  

the company develops manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer and specialty products it recognizes revenues and profits from selling its products under a variety of brands including arm  hammer and trojan to consumers through supermarkets drug stores and mass merchandisers and to industrial customers and distributors on may 28 2004 the company acquired the joint venture interest in armkel owned by affiliates of kelso  company and armkel was merged into the company this is sometimes referred as “the armkel acquisition” the discussion of results of operations of armkel are reflected in the results of operations since the acquisition on may 28 2004 

  

the company is divided into three primary segments consumer domestic consumer international and specialty products our consumer domestic segment includes household products for deodorizing and cleaning such as arm  hammer baking soda cat litter scrubfree brillo cleaning products and laundry products such as xtra and arm  hammer laundry detergents and personal care products such as trojan condoms nair depilatories and waxes first response and answer home pregnancy and ovulation test kits arrid antiperspirant and arm  hammer mentadent closeup pepsodent and aim toothpastes our consumer international segment sells a variety of personal care products some of which use the same brands as our domestic product lines in international markets including france the united kingdom canada mexico australia and spain our specialty products segment is the largest us producer of sodium bicarbonate which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial institutional medical and food applications this segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 our consumer domestic consumer international and specialty products segments “spd” represented approximately 74 12 and 14 respectively of net sales 

  

for the two year period ended december 31 2004 the company’s earnings per share has grown at an average rate of approximately 13 its sales has increased from 10471 million in 2002 to 14621 million in 2004 and its gross profit margin increased from 297 in 2002 to 365 in 2004 the major reasons for these increases stem from the unilever oral care business and armkel acquisitions 

  

the company operates in highly competitive consumer product markets in which cost efficiency new product offerings and innovation are critical to success the consumer products markets are particularly mature in north america and are characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents and oral care furthermore because of ongoing retail sector consolidation and the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from these customers particularly the highvolume retail store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to protect our existing market share or to capture increased market share the company has had to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and to introduce and establish new products consequently the need for ongoing cost cutting initiatives needs to be sustained as new product introductions or product line extensions remain the most viable path to generating organic topline growth given the mature nature of most product categories in north american markets through its recent acquisitions the company has been able to lower its overall unit costs and increase the productivity of its various manufacturing facilities this has resulted in higher levels of cash flow 

  

in the specialty products segment competition within the specialty chemicals and animal nutrition product lines remained intense in 2003 and 2004 specialty chemicals operates in a competitive environment influenced by capacity utilization buyers’ leverage and the impact of raw material and energy costs with respect to the animal nutrition product line the company continues to face higher ingredient costs for its line of nutritional supplements under the megalac brand name and weathered a poor us dairy economy in 2003 which had a severe impact on the purchasing ability and financial viability of dairymen to meet these challenges the specialty products business pursued an important business improvement initiative which was aimed at improving its longer term operational effectiveness and cost structure 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience our observance of trends in industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate our critical accounting policies include 

  

promotional and sales returns reserves 

  

the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers such as coupons and sales incentives made to vendors such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are recorded when the related sale is recognized coop advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company’s products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded when product is sold relating to the promotion the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates 

  

to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of coupons redeemed over the past couple of years a 01 deviation in the actual rate of redemptions versus the rate accrued for in the financial statements could result in approximately a 2 million difference in the reserve required with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns we use experiencebased estimates customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if the company’s estimates for vendor promotional activities and sales returns were to differ by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 60 million while we believe that our promotional and sales returns reserves are adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future during the twelve months ended december 31 2004 the company reversed prior year promotion liabilities of approximately 102 million based on changes to previous estimates and in 2003 and 2002 the company reversed prior year promotion liabilities of approximately 13 million and 53 million respectively 

  

impairment of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets and property plant and equipment 

  

carrying values of goodwill trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the company’s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trademarks and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 

  

property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the company’s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology the continued success of product lines and future volume revenue and expense growth rates the company conducts annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when an impairment is indicated the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows 

  

the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated value of future cash flows and would have increased or decreased any impairment charge taken future outcomes may also differ if the company’s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized then the company’s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in 2004 the company recognized tradename impairment plant impairment and equipment obsolescence charges of approximately 67 million which was included in the operating results of the consumer domestic segment in 2003 the company recognized an impairment charge of 27 million on manufacturing equipment which was charged to the consumer domestic segment in 2002 the company recognized tradename equipment obsolescence and plant impairment charges of approximately 62 million which was charged to the consumer domestic segment 

  

inventory valuation 

  

when appropriate the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value including any costs to sell or dispose the company identifies any slow moving obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company’s products technological changes and new product introductions the estimates as to the future demand used in the valuation of inventory are dependent on the ongoing success of the company’s products in addition the company’s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the rationalization of the number of stock keeping units “sku’s” the number of sku’s has been reduced by approximately 27 over the last 2 years to minimize this risk the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required adjustments to the inventory’s net realizable value were 59 million at december 31 2004 and 32 million at december 31 2003 

  

valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs 

  

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to our actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 

  

the discount rate is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans and postretirement plans we refer to applicable indices such as the moody’s aa corporate bond index to select a rate at which we believe the pension benefits could be effectively settled based on the published rates as of december 31 2004 as well as selected corporate bonds matching our estimated cash flows of the plans the company used a discount rate of 575 for the three remaining domestic plans a decline of 25 basis points from the 600 rate used in 2003 this had the effect of increasing the projected benefit obligation for pensions and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately 15 million and 04 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend based on a 15 year average the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans the asset mix of the plans and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation based on these factors the company’s weighted average expected longterm rate of return as of december 31 2004 is 761 a decline of 111 basis points from the 872 rate used at december 31 2003 this decrease is due to the change in the expected longterm rate of the company’s domestic plans from 875 to 825 and the inclusion of armkel’s plans a 50 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return would result in less than a 04 million change in pension expense for 2005 

  

on december 31 2004 the accumulated benefit obligation related to our pension plans exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets such excess is referred to as an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation this difference is attributed to 1 an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation that resulted from the decrease in the interest rate used to discount the projected benefit obligation to its present settlement amount from 600 to 575 partially offset by 2 the increase in the market value of the plan assets at december 31 2004 as a result in accordance with sfas no 87 the company recognized an additional minimum pension liability of 14 million included in benefit obligations and recorded a charge net of tax to accumulated other comprehensive loss of 08 million which decreased stockholders’ equity the charge to stockholders’ equity for the excess of additional pension liability represents a net loss not yet recognized as pension expense based on the aforementioned assumptions the income statement impact for 2004 is estimated to be approximately 08 million charged to earnings on a cash basis an estimated contribution of approximately 54 million will be required in 2005 

  

tax contingencies 

  

the company records liabilities in income taxes payable for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions the liabilities relate to tax return positions although supportable by the company that may be challenged by the tax authorities the company adjusts these liabilities as a result of changes in tax legislation interpretations of laws by courts rulings by tax authorities changes in estimates and the closing of the statute of limitations the company’s tax rate includes the impact of the liabilities and any changes to the liabilities settlement of any issue with the tax authorities would require the use of cash favorable resolution of an issue would be recognized as a reduction to the company’s annual tax rate the irs is currently examining the company’s 2002 us federal corporation income tax return and to date no adjustments have been proposed

consolidated results 

2004 compared to 2003 

  

net sales 

  

net sales increased by 4052 million or 383 to 14621 million compared to 10569 million in the previous year the increase is primarily due to the armkel acquisition and the oral care business acquisition which contributed sales of 3804 million in 2004 also contributing to the increase was the effect of favorable foreign exchange rates of 46 million and 102 million resulting from the reversal of prior year’s promotion reserves due to a change in estimate the 2003 sales also included 252 million generated by the oral care business which was acquired in fourth quarter and 13 million due to the reversal of prior year promotion adjustments 

  

operating costs 

  

the company’s gross margin increased to 365 from 301 in the prior year the increase in gross margin is primarily due to the armkel acquisition and full year effect of the oral care business acquisition the acquired products carry a higher gross margin than the company’s existing product lines prior to the acquisitions included in the 2004 gross margin was the impact of a 105 million inventory related purchase accounting charge associated with the armkel acquisition and a 15 million plant impairment charge gross profit in 2003 included a 59 million inventory related purchase accounting charge related to the oral care business acquisition 

  

marketing expenses of 1612 million increased 724 million or 81 from 2003 approximately 62 million of the increase is associated with the acquired armkel and oral care brands marketing expenses for existing brands increased 10 million primarily in support of deodorizing and cleaning products personal care products and new product activity this increase was partially offset by lower expense for brillo scrub’n toss which was introduced in 2003 

  

selling general and administrative expenses of 2005 million increased 831 million or 41 as compared to 2003 this increase is primarily due to approximately 620 million associated with the former armkel business and additional costs in support of the oral care business acquisition other increases include 4 million of severance costs and the termination costs relating to one of the company’s foreign subsidiary’s pension plan a 19 million tradename impairment charge higher performance related compensation costs of 64 million higher sarbanesoxley compliance expenses of 37 million and higher research  development “rd” expenses of 17 million exclusive of costs to support the acquired armkel and oral care brands 

  

other income and expenses 

  

the decrease in equity in earnings of affiliates of 135 million reflects the consolidation of the armkel acquisition since may 28 2004 included in the company’s equity earnings from armkel in 2004 is a 25 million tradename impairment charge the 2003 result benefited from a litigation settlement partially offset by an impairment of an asset held for sale for a net contribution to the company of approximately 5 million the combined results of the company’s other equity investments armand products company “armand” and the armakleen company “armakleen” increased by 08 million 

  

interest expense increased 210 million to  414 million the increase can be attributed primarily to increased debt that was assumed by the company as part of the armkel acquisition and new debt required to purchase the remaining interest in armkel a 49 million third quarter interest payment related to a legal settlement and the full year effect of the debt required to purchase the oral care business 

  

net loss on early extinguishment of debt of 229 million includes an 80 million charge incurred in the second quarter of 2004 associated with the company’s bank debt refinancing to effect the acquisition of armkel and a 149 million charge in the fourth quarter related to the redemption of the armkel 9 ½ senior subordinated notes due 2009 assumed as part of the armkel acquisition the charge in 2003 of 41 million was associated with the bank debt refinanced to acquire the oral care business 

  

investment income was approximately 19 million higher than in 2003 as a result of a higher amount of investable cash available and slightly higher interest rates 

  

other income and expense includes the effect of foreign exchange remeasurement gains related to intercompany loans between the company’s subsidiaries 

  

taxation 

  

the tax rate for 2004 was 303 as compared to 308 in 2003 this year’s tax rate was favorably impacted by prior year rd tax credits and other items of 46 million the 2003 tax rate included a settlement of a state tax matter as well as the resolution of other tax contingencies 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

net sales 

  

net sales increased by 98 million or 09 to 10569 million compared to 10471 million in the previous year the majority of this increase was due to the additional sales resulting from the fourth quarter acquisition of certain assets of unilever’s oral care business in the united states and canada other increases included the effects of foreign exchange of approximately 30 million and the reversal of prior period promotion reserves of approximately 13 million due to a change in estimate these increases were partially offset by the company’s change in revenue recognition policy from fob shipping point to fob destination point which reduced sales by approximately 63 million in 2003 sales in 2002 included a similar change in promotion estimate of 53 million as well as the discontinuation of certain former usa detergents cleaners and former carterwallace pet care products of approximately 86 million the impact of these discontinued products was approximately 12 million in 2003 

  

operating costs 

  

the company’s gross margin increased to 301 from 297 in the prior year this increase in gross margin represented a substantial improvement in the consumer domestic product margin partially offset by a substantial reduction in specialty products margin the higher consumer products margin was due to the fullyear benefits of the integration of certain former carterwallace products completed in 2002 as well as additional purchasing manufacturing and distribution efficiencies associated with economies of scale achieved in 2003 partially offset by higher startup costs and promotion expenses associated with new product introductions the lower specialty products margin was primarily due to higher ingredient costs for the animal nutrition business 

  

marketing expenses increased 26 million to 888 million the increase was primarily associated with advertising expenses for personal care products namely arm  hammer dentifrice and arrid brands as well as the marketing costs associated with the newly introduced cleaning product brillo scrub’n toss partially offset by a reduction in advertising expenses for other personal care products 

  

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 32 million this decrease was primarily a result of the elimination of transition related expenses incurred in 2002 associated with the carterwallace products acquired in the fourth quarter of 2001 and tradename impairment charges recorded in 2002 partially offset by higher personnel related expenses 

  

other income and expenses 

  

the increase in equity in earnings of affiliates of 71 million was almost entirely due to the company’s prorata share in the year over year increase in earnings from armkel armkel’s earnings increase for the year was primarily a result of a litigation settlement in the second quarter partially offset by an impairment of an asset held for sale for a net contribution to the company of approximately 5 million this increase over the prior year also reflected a strong performance by international operations partially offset by significantly weaker domestic results earnings in 2002 reflected the disproportionate recapture of 5 million of allocated losses sustained in the fourth quarter of 2001 in accordance with the terms of the armkel joint venture agreement the prior period increase was also impacted by the inventory stepup charge in the first quarter of 2002 related to armkel’s opening inventory values the combined results of the company’s other equity investments armand and armakleen were virtually unchanged 

  

investment earnings were lower as a result of lower interest rates on funds invested 

  

interest expense increased 05 million for the year even though there was a significant reduction in average debt outstanding at lower interest rates this is because the company recorded a 49 million charge to write off deferred financing costs related to previous financing transactions and settlement of interest rate swaps 

  

other income and expense includes foreign exchange gains realized by the company’s brazilian subsidiary while 2002 was unfavorably affected by foreign exchange losses incurred by the same subsidiary 

  

taxation 

  

the effective tax rate for the year was 308 compared to 340 in the previous year this decrease is primarily a result of a settlement of a state tax matter as well as the resolution of other tax contingencies

consumer domestic 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

consumer domestic net sales increased 2450 million to 10771 million for the year the increase is largely due to the armkel and oral care business acquisitions which contributed an additional 2149 million in sales and the reversal of 96 million of prior year promotion reserves due to a change in estimate at the product line level after accounting for the effect of the previously mentioned items net sales of deodorizing and cleaning products rose strongly laundry products rose slightly and personal care products declined at the brand level sales of arm  hammer and xtra liquid laundry detergent arm  hammer super scoop cat litter and arm  hammer toothpaste were all above last year while sales of laundry detergent powder fabric softeners and antiperspirants were lower the trend of higher liquid laundry detergent and lower powder detergent sales continued in 2004 as an increasing number of consumers switch to the liquid form of the product 

  

consumer domestic income before taxes and minority interests increased 230 million to 1127 million in 2004 as compared to 897 million in 2003 this is primarily a result of the armkel and oral care business acquisitions this increase was negatively impacted by the inventory related purchase accounting charge in 2004 of 82 million a 15 million plant impairment charge and a tradename impairment charge of 19 million the results of 2003 include the effect of a 59 million inventory related purchase accounting charge existing consumer domestic products earnings contributions were slightly higher in 2004 as a result of higher gross profit partially offset by higher marketing in support of deodorizing and cleaning products certain personal care products new product activity and sga expenses the segments earnings from affiliates was significantly lower than in 2003 as a result of the armkel acquisition whose results since may 28 2004 are included in the segment’s operating results interest expense was significantly higher due to the debt required to purchase armkel debt assumed as part of the armkel acquisition and the full year effect of interest associated with the debt to purchase the oral care business 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

consumer domestic net sales were essentially unchanged at 8321 million for the year which reflected the fourth quarter unilever acquisition partially offset by a change in revenue recognition policy major factors that impacted comparative product lines performance included a 13 million reversal of prior year promotion reserves due to a change in estimate net sales in 2002 reflected a similar change in promotion estimate of 53 million furthermore consumer domestic net sales were also lower due to discontinuation of some former usa detergents cleaners and former carterwallace pet care products which impacted the deodorizing and cleaning products line net sales of liquid laundry detergent were significantly higher and more than offset the continuing industry trend of declining powder laundry detergent sales as an increasing number of consumers switched to the liquid form of the product in the laundry products line personal care products exclusive of the impact of the oral care business acquisition were lower in part because of a reduction in gum sales and the discontinued arm  hammer breathcare line 

  

consumer domestic income before taxes and minority interest increased 152 million or 203 to 897 million mostly due to a 95 million increase in gross profit with more than half of this increase attributable to the acquired oral care brands the remainder of the gross profit improvement was the result of improved laundry product margins as well as lower manufacturing costs for arrid antiperspirant after the relocation of manufacturing to the lakewood plant from the former carterwallace cranbury plant higher marketing expenses of 41 million were incurred mainly to support the newly introduced cleaning product brillo scrub’n toss as well as by higher advertising costs for arrid antiperspirant and arm  hammer dentifrice partially offset by lower marketing costs for the gum line and the discontinued breathcare line selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 20 million due to the elimination of transition related expenses incurred in 2002 associated with carterwallace products acquired by the company in the fourth quarter of 2001 in addition selling general and administrative expenses in 2002 reflected tradename impairment charges of 23 million these factors were partially offset by higher personnel related costs equity in armkel’s earnings increased 27 million as a result of a higher gross margin which was negatively impacted in 2002 by armkel’s recognition of the remainder of its purchase accounting inventory step up charge and lower selling general and administrative expenses partially offset by higher marketing expenses 

  

consumer international 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

consumer international’s net sales rose 1397 million to 1767 million this increase includes 1380 million that was attributable to the former armkel foreign subsidiaries and 24 million associated with favorable foreign exchange rates existing product sales were virtually unchanged 

  

consumer international income before taxes and minority interest of 153 million was 37 million or 315 higher than in 2003 primarily due to contributions from the former armkel foreign subsidiaries higher operating profit of 96 million was partially offset by lower equity in earnings of affiliates of 38 million and an allocation of interest expense the 2004 results include a 23 million inventory related purchase accounting charge relating to the armkel acquisition and a charge included in sga for the termination of a pension plan 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

consumer international’s net sales of 370 million were 53 million or 169 higher than 2002 favorable foreign exchange of 29 million and increased export sales of 11 million were the main contributors to the higher sales 

  

consumer international income before taxes and minority interest increased 50 million to 116 million the major reason for the increase was higher equity income from armkel’s foreign subsidiaries of 44 million which reflected higher sales and gross profit and lower selling general and administrative expenses partially offset by higher marketing expenses favorable exchange rates also contributed to higher earnings 

  

specialty products 

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

specialty products net sales increased 204 million or 109 to 2083 million in 2004 due to higher sales of animal nutrition and specialty chemical products also impacting the sales increase was favorable foreign exchange rates of approximately 22 million 

  

specialty products income before taxes and minority interest of 180 million was 18 million or 111 above last year this increase is due to higher gross profit contributions by both animal nutrition and specialty chemical products partially offset by higher marketing expenses in support of animal nutrition products and a higher amount of allocated interest expense 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

specialty products net sales grew 48 million or 26 due to higher specialty chemicals sales which included the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates at the company’s subsidiaries in the united kingdom and brazil partially offset by lower sales of animal nutrition products and the impact from the change in revenue recognition policy 

  

specialty products income before taxes and minority interest decreased by 04 million to 162 million for the year the decrease was mainly a result of a 37 million decrease in gross profit due to higher manufacturing costs in certain animal nutrition and specialty chemical products particularly a palm oil derivative used in animal nutrition offsetting factors were lower marketing expenses of 15 million mostly with respect to the animal nutrition products combined with flat year over year selling general and administrative expenses and a 07 million reduction in interest expense 

  

competitive environment 

  

many of our competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company unilever inc the clorox company colgatepalmolive company the gillette company sc johnson  son inc pfizer inverness and ssl international which have greater financial resources than the company these companies have the capacity to outspend the company in an attempt to gain market share 

  

because of the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from these customers particularly the highvolume retail store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms these concessions or terms could reduce the company’s margins furthermore if the company is unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to its trade customers the customers could increase product purchases from our competitors which would harm the company’s sales and profitability 

  

consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced such as laundry and household cleaning products are subject to significant price competition from time to time the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share 

  

the company has entered the oral care and personal care and deodorizing businesses using the unique strengths of its arm  hammer trademark and baking soda technology these are highly innovative markets characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and requiring heavy advertising and promotion

during the first quarter of 2003 the company entered into a receivables purchase agreement with an issuer of receivablesbacked commercial paper in order to refinance a portion 600 million of its primary credit facility under this arrangement the company sold and will sell from time to time throughout the threeyear term of the agreement its trade accounts receivable to a whollyowned consolidated special purpose finance subsidiary harrison street funding llc a delaware limited liability company “harrison” harrison in turn sold and will sell on an ongoing basis to the commercial paper issuer an undivided interest in the pool of accounts receivable the receivables assets and the shortterm borrowings of harrison are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company the transactions were entered into to reduce certain expenses associated with the credit facility in addition to lowering the company’s financing costs by accessing the commercial paper market during july 2004 as a result of purchasing kelso’s interest in armkel the company amended its accounts receivable securitization agreement to increase the capacity that can be borrowed from 60 million to the current 100 million the balance outstanding under the agreement on december 31 2004 was 937 million the proceeds of the increased borrowing were used to make a voluntary term a loan payment on august 4 2004 

  

in august of 2003 the company issued 100 million principal amount of 525 convertible senior debentures due august 15 2033 through a private placement to qualified institutional buyers the debentures rank equal in right of payment with all of the company’s existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness the debentures are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of the company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness and to all of the existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the company’s subsidiaries the company has the right to redeem all or part of the debentures on or after august 15 2008 interest is paid semiannually on august 15th and february 15th of each year 

  

on each of august 15 2010 august 15 2013 august 15 2018 august 15 2023 and august 15 2028 or in the event of a change in control holders may require the company to repurchase all or any portion of the debentures at a purchase price equal to 1000 of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase the company must pay cash for any debentures repurchased on august 15 2010 however the company may choose to pay cash shares of its common stock or a combination of cash or shares of its common stock for any debentures repurchased on august 15 2013 august 15 2018 august 15 2023 or august 15 2028 or following a change in control

because of the inclusion of the restricted convertibility feature of the debentures the company’s diluted net income per common share calculation effective for periods ending before december 15 2004 did not account for the effect to the dilution from the conversion of the debentures until the company’s share price exceeded the 20 conversion price premium or one of the other events described above occurs however the emerging issues task force eitf concluded in eitf issue 048 “the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share” that contingently convertible debt “cocos” be treated for diluted earnings per share purposes as if converted from debt to equity beginning with the date the contingently convertible debt instrument is initially issued even if the triggering events such as stock price have not yet occurred and prior period eps amounts presented for comparative purposes would have to be restated the company has implemented this consensus in its 2004 financial statements which had the effect of lowering 2004 diluted earnings per share by 001 and did not have an effect on 2003 and 2002 earnings per share

prime rate the secondary market rate for threemonth certificates of deposit adjusted for any reserve requirements plus the applicable fdic assessment rate plus 10 or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 “alternate base rate” plus b an applicable margin the applicable margin is determined by the company’s current leverage ratio at the closing date of the credit agreement the applicable margin was a 175 for the eurocurrency rate and b 075 for the alternate base rate

as noted above on december 22 2004 the company issued 250 million of 60 senior subordinated notes due december 15 2012 “notes” with interest paid semiannually the notes were issued at par and the company received 225 million of proceeds that were used to redeem 2186 million of the armkel notes and the balance was used to make voluntary bank debt repayments the notes will be guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by substantially all of the company’s existing and future domestic subsidiaries whose annual revenues other than intercompany revenues or total assets other than intercompany receivables are 100000 or more the notes will be redeemable at the company’s option in whole or in part at any time on or after december 15 2008 at pre determined redemption prices together with accrued and unpaid interest if any to the date of redemption the notes will be redeemable at the company’s option in whole or in part at any time prior to december 15 2008 at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the date of redemption plus a “makewhole” premium at any time prior to december 15 2007 the company may redeem up to 35 of the original principal amount of the notes calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional notes issued under the same indenture with the proceeds of one or more equity offerings of the company’s capital stock at a redemption price of 1060 of the principal amount of the notes together with accrued and unpaid interest if any to the date of redemption 

  

the terms of the subordinated note and credit agreement place a limit on the amount of certain cash payments the company can make this limitation includes the amount the company can pay in dividends on its common stock as long as the company is not in default under either agreement the limitation  which is a percentage of net income relative to the company’s consolidated leverage ratio is such that the company does not currently anticipate having an effect on its ability to pay dividends at its current rate 

  

in addition qgn has lines of credit which allow it to borrow in its local currency this amounts to 7 million of which approximately 3 million was utilized as of december 31 2004 and 2003 the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings at december 31 2004 and 2003 was approximately 18 and 153 respectively qgn’s longterm debt is at various interest rates that are determined by several local inflation indexes 

  

adjusted ebitda is a required component of the financial covenants contained in the company’s primary credit facility and senior subordinated notes management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda is useful to investors as a financial indicator of the company’s ability to service its indebtedness adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states financial covenants include a total debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio which if not met could result in an event of default and trigger the early termination of the credit facility and notes if not remedied within a certain period of time the definition of adjusted ebitda in the notes are not materially different than that of the credit agreement 

  

adjusted ebitda was approximately 2870 million for 2004 the leverage ratio total debt to adjusted ebitda for the twelve months december 31 2004 which under the credit agreement permitted the inclusion of armkel’s ebitda prior to its acquisition by the company for pro forma purposes was 296 versus the agreement’s maximum 425 and the interest coverage ratio adjusted ebitda to total interest expense was 53 versus the agreement’s minimum of 30 this credit agreement is secured by the assets of the company and certain domestic subsidiaries the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted ebitda is as follows in millions

during 2003 cash flow from operating activities was 1179 million major factors contributing to the cash flow from operating activities included operating earnings before noncash charges for depreciation and amortization a decrease in working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents partially offset by the net noncash impact from the equity in earnings of affiliates operating cash flow together with new bank borrowing activity the issuance of convertible debt and proceeds obtained through a receivables purchase agreement described above were used to fund the investing activities to acquire certain assets of unilever’s oral care business in the united states and canada and to pay for additions to property plant and equipment remaining cash was used to make both voluntary and mandatory debt repayments and the proceeds from stock options exercised helped to pay cash dividends

financial condition

certain risks and uncertainties related to the company’s business 

  

the following risks and uncertainties as well as others described in this annual report on form 10k could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

  

   

the company has recently introduced a number of new consumer products such as brillo scrub ‘n toss disposable cleaning pads and arm  hammer easy flush clumping cat litter the development and introduction of new products involves substantial research development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in addition if the new products merely cause sales of the company’s existing products to decline the financial performance of the company could be harmed 

  

   

in the past the company has discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shut down costs the company may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent it discontinues products that do not meet expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand product returns writeoffs or shut down costs would reduce cash flow and earnings product efficacy or safety concerns could result in product recalls or declining sales which would reduce cash flow and earnings 

  

   

during 2003 91 of the company’s sales were generated in us markets us markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to the company’s most significant product categories such as laundry detergents deodorizers and household cleaning products toothpastes and antipersipirants and deodorants the company’s unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of its products by consumers product innovation and its ability to capture market share from competitors the company may not succeed in implementing its strategies to increase domestic revenues 

  

the consumer products industry particularly the laundry detergent personal care and air deodorizer categories is intensely competitive to protect its existing market share or to capture increased market share the company may need to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and introduce and establish new products increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing market share and could result in lower sales and profits many of the company’s competitors including the procter  gamble company unilever inc the clorox company colgatepalmolive company gillette co dial corp and sc johnson  son inc are substantially larger companies that have greater financial resources than the company has these competitors have the capacity to outspend the company should they attempt to gain market share in addition if the company loses market share and the markets in which it competes do not grow the company’s sales levels and operating results would decline 

  

   

consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced like many of the company’s products are subject to significant price competition and in recent years have been characterized by price deflation from time to time the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction in prices to respond to these pressures would harm profit margins in addition if the company’s sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins its results of operations would suffer 

  

because of the competitive environment facing retailers many of the company’s trade customers particularly its highvolume retail store customers have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to the extent the company provides concessions or better trade terms its margins are reduced further if the company is unable to maintain terms that are acceptable to its trade customers these trade customers could reduce purchases of the company’s products and increase purchases of products from its competitors which would harm the company’s sales and profitability 

  

   

from time to time the company’s retail customers have reduced inventory levels in managing their working capital requirements any reduction in inventory levels by the company’s retail customers would harm its operating results for the financial periods affected by the reductions in particular continued consolidation within the retail industry could potentially reduce inventory levels maintained by the company’s retail customers which could adversely affect its results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions 

  

   

the company’s performance also depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and by the financial difficulties of retailers industry wide consumer products such as those marketed by the company are increasingly being sold in club stores and mass merchandisers while sales of consumer products by food and drug stores are comprising a smaller proportion of the total volume of consumer products sold sales of the company’s products are stronger in the food and drug channels of trade and not as strong with the club stores and mass merchandisers although the company has taken steps to improve sales in club stores and mass merchandisers if it is not successful in improving sales to these channels and the current trend continues the company’s financial condition and operating results could suffer 

  

   

walmart including its affiliate sam’s club is the company’s largest customer accounting for 17 of net sales in 2003 16 of net sales in 2002 and 14 of net sales in 2001 the company’s top three customers accounted for 26 of net sales in 2003 and 23 of net sales in each of 2002 and 2001 the loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by walmart or any of the company’s other top customers would harm the company’s sales and profitability 

  

   

the company has made several acquisitions in the past few years including the acquisition of usa detergents inc biovance technologies inc unilever’s oral care brands in the united states and canada and some of the consumer products businesses of carterwallace inc and may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future any future acquisitions or investments would entail various risks including the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential disruption of the company’s ongoing business and generally the company’s potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment these factors could harm the company’s financial condition and operating results any future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures the issuance of new equity in the company and the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities in addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not they are ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and divert other resources from other matters that are critical to the company’s operations 

  

   

armkel’s distribution of condoms under the trojan and other trademarks is regulated by the us food and drug administration fda certain of armkel’s condoms contain the spermicide nonoxynol9 n9 the world health organization and other interested groups have issued reports suggesting that n9 should not be used rectally or 

  

for multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse given the ingredient’s potential to cause irritation to human membranes the company expects the fda to issue nonbinding draft guidance concerning the labeling of condoms with n9 although the timing of such draft guidance is uncertain the company believes that condoms with n9 provide an acceptable added means of contraceptive protection and it is cooperating with the fda concerning the appropriate labeling revisions if any however the company cannot predict the outcome of the fda review while labeling guidance from the fda is pending the company has implemented an interim label statement change cautioning against rectal use and multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse the company also disseminates this cautionary statement on its product web site and in other consumer product vehicles 

  

in addition in march 2003 a nonbinding resolution was introduced in the california state assembly which if passed would urge the fda to ban condoms containing n9 and encourage california manufacturers and retailers to cease the production and sale of condoms containing n9 as amended in august 2003 the resolution cites the reports noted in the preceding paragraph as well as more recent information suggesting that n9 may lead to an increase in urinary tract infections among females the passage of this resolution could result in publicity that may add to activist pressure on retailers to cease carrying condoms with n9 while the company does not consider the level of retailer concern on this issue to be significant it cannot predict the impact of the introduction of this resolution 

  

if the fda or state governments take action that prohibit or restrict the use of n9 in condoms such as new labeling requirements armkel could incur further costs from obsolete products packaging or raw materials and sales of condoms could decline which in turn could decrease the value of the company’s interest in armkel 

  

   

increases in the prices of raw materials such as surfactants which are cleaning agents paper products and bottles or increases in energy costs could significantly affect the company’s profit margins the company uses surfactants and bottles in the manufacture and marketing of laundry and household cleaning products such as arm  hammer and xtra laundry detergents and scrub free and clean shower bathroom cleaners the company uses paper products for packaging in many of its consumer and specialty chemical products if price increases were to occur the company may not be able to increase the prices of its products to offset these increases this could harm the company’s financial condition and operating results

overview 

  

the company develops manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer and specialty products it recognizes revenues and profits from selling its products primarily under the arm hammer trademark to consumers through supermarkets drug stores and mass merchandisers and to industrial customers and distributors in 2003 consumer products represented approximately 82 and specialty products 18 of the company’s net sales the company does approximately 91 of its business in the united states 

  

armkel llc an equally owned joint venture between the company and the private equity group kelso  company manufactures and markets wellrecognized branded personal care consumer products armkel’s trojan brand occupies the number one position in the domestic condom market and its nair brand occupies the number two position in the domestic depilatory and waxes market furthermore armkel is the number two provider of home pregnancy and ovulation test kits to consumers in the united states these kits are marketed under the first response and answer brand names under the terms of its joint venture agreement with kelso the company has a call option to acquire kelso’s interest in armkel beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004 at fair market value as defined in the joint venture agreement subject to a floor and a cap the call option remains in effect through the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2006 at which time kelso may request the company to purchase its interest for further discussion surrounding the joint venture agreement see the armkel section of liquidity and capital resources contained herein 

  

the company’s primary financial objective and key performance indicator is to achieve average annual earnings per share growth of 125 to 15 for the period 2003 to 2005 the company expects to achieve this objective through a combination of sales from newly created and existing products referred to as organic growth margin improvement acquisition benefits from the recently acquired oral care brands lower financing costs and potentially the acquisition of the remaining 50 interest in armkel 

  

with regard to sales objectives the company plans to concentrate on a few highvalue initiatives plus the stabilization of the declining sales trend in the former unilever brands in 2004 the company will also be reviewing and modifying its promotion strategy using new systems tools which became operational late in 2003 while difficult to predict the company currently expects high single digit sales growth for the year including the acquired brands as to margins the company’s objective is to improve its combined gross margin by an average of at least 1 a year assuming no significant change in commodity prices 

  

the company operates in highly competitive consumerproduct markets in which cost efficiency new product offerings and innovation are critical to success the consumer products markets are particularly mature in north america and characterized by high household penetration particularly with respect to our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents the consumer products industry particularly the laundry detergent personal care and deodorizing categories is intensely competitive and is not expected to improve any time soon furthermore because of ongoing retail sector consolidation and the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from these customers particularly the highvolume retail store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms to protect our existing market share or to capture increased market share the company has had to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and to introduce and establish new products consequently the need for ongoing cost cutting initiatives needs to be sustained as new product introductions or productline extensions remain the most viable path to generating organic topline growth given the mature nature of most product categories in north american markets through the recent acquisitions of usa detergents and carterwallace’s consumer business in 2001 and the fourth quarter 2003 acquisition of unilever’s oral care business as well as additional purchasing manufacturing and distribution efficiencies obtained through economies of scale achieved in 2003 the company has been able to lower its overall unit costs and increase the productivity of its various manufacturing facilities this has resulted in generating higher levels of free cash flow 

  

with regard to the acquisition of unilever’s oral care business which had experienced sales declines over the past few years management believes the acquisition provides attractive opportunities for the following reasons 

  

   

   

   

   

in the specialty products business competition within the specialty chemicals and animal nutrition product lines remained intense in 2003 specialty chemicals particularly sodium bicarbonate have been negatively impacted for several years through new technology developed by a number of nahcolitebased sodium bicarbonate manufacturers who have been operating at the lower end of the business and have been making an effort to enter the higher end to strengthen its competitive position the company over the last couple of years completed the modernization of its green river facility to provide better availability of specialized grades and increased production capacity at the old fort facility the company also has been increasing its rd spending on health care food processing and other highend applications for sodium bicarbonate as well as alternative products to compete with the lower end of the market as a result merchant performance sodium bicarbonate sales volume grew 1 from 2002 with respect to the animal nutrition product line the company faced significantly higher ingredient costs for its line of nutritional supplements under the megalac brand name and weathered a poor us dairy economy which had a severe impact on the purchasing ability and financial viability of dairymen consequently animal nutrition sales were virtually flat and operating profit declined by 16 million to meet these challenges the specialty products business pursued an important business improvement initiative which was aimed at improving its longer term operational effectiveness and cost structure this 36 week project completed in the later part of 2003 is expected to deliver annualized benefits in excess of 17 million a rigorous stagegate process for new product development a redesigned organization and a business management system based on key performance indicators 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience our observance of trends in industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate our critical accounting policies include 

  

promotional and sales returns reserves 

  

the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers such as coupons and sales incentives made to vendors such as slotting cooperative advertising incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements all such costs are netted against sales slotting costs are expensed when the related sale is recognized coop advertising costs are expensed when the customer places the advertisement for the company’s products discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place costs associated with endaisle or other instore displays are recorded at the completion of the related sale the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves for example the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements based on the total face value of coupons dropped over the past couple of years a 1 deviation in the actual rate of redemptions versus the rate accrued for in the financial statements could result in approximately a 3 million difference in the reserve required with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns we use experiencebased appropriations customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required if the company’s estimates for vendor promotional activities and sales returns were to differ by 10 the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately 39 million while we believe that our promotional and sales returns reserves are adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future during 2003 the company reversed prior year promotion liabilities of approximately 13 million based on adjustments to previous estimates and in 2002 the company reversed prior year promotion liabilities of approximately 53 million 

  

impairment of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets and property plant and equipment 

  

carrying values of goodwill trademarks and other intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the company’s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions with respect to goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit for trademarks and other intangible assets an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated cash flows which represents the estimated fair value of the asset the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

  

property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the company’s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology the continued success of product lines and future volume revenue and expense growth rates the company conducts annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows when an impairment is indicated the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows 

  

the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated value of future cash flows and would have increased or decreased any impairment charge taken future outcomes may also differ if the company’s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized then the company’s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in 2003 the company recognized an impairment charge of 27 million on manufacturing equipment in 2002 the company recognized trademark equipment obsolescence and plant impairment charges of approximately 62 million 

  

inventory valuation 

  

when appropriate the company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value including any costs to sell or dispose the company identifies any slow moving obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether a valuation allowance is indicated the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company’s products technological changes and new product introductions the estimates as to the future demand used in the valuation of inventory are dependent on the ongoing success of its products in addition the company’s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the rationalization of the number of stock keeping units to minimize this risk the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required adjustments to the inventory’s net realizable value were 32 million at december 31 2003 and 53 million at december 31 2002 

  

valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs 

  

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to our actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 

  

the discount rate is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans and postretirement plans we refer to applicable indices such as the moody’s aa corporate bond index to select a rate at which we believe the pension benefits could be effectively settled based on the published rates as of december 31 2003 the company used a discount rate of 60 for both plans a decline of 75 basis points from the 675 rate used in 2002 this had the effect of increasing the projected benefit obligation for pensions and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately 19 million and 11 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend based on a 15 year average the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans the asset mix of the plans and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation based on these factors the company’s expected longterm rate of return as of december 31 2003 is 825 a decline of 50 basis points from the 875 rate used at december 31 2002 a 50 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return would result in less than a 1 million change in pension expense for 2004 

  

on december 31 2003 the accumulated benefit obligation related to our pension plans exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets such excess is referred to as an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation this difference is attributed to 1 an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation that resulted from the decrease in the interest rate used to discount the projected benefit obligation to its present settlement amount from 675 to 600 partially offset by 2 the increase in the market value of the plan assets at december 31 2003 as a result in accordance with sfas no 87 the company recognized an additional minimum pension liability of 24 million included in benefit obligations and recorded a charge net of tax to accumulated other comprehensive loss of 15 million which decreased stockholders’ equity the charge to stockholders’ equity for the excess of additional pension liability represents a net loss not yet recognized as pension expense based on the aforementioned assumptions the income statement impact for 2004 is estimated to be approximately 08 million charged to earnings on a cash basis an estimated contribution of approximately 07 million will be required in 2004 

  

tax contingencies 

  

tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities these potential exposures result from the varying applications of statutes rules regulations and interpretations the company’s estimated value of tax contingencies contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions the company believes these tax contingencies are reasonable 

  

results of operations 

  

the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment the discussion of our segment operating results is presented on a historical basis for the years ending december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 including the results of unconsolidated affiliates the segment discussion also presents certain product line fluctuations 

  

consolidated results 

2003 compared to 2002 

  

net sales 

  

net sales increased by 98 million or 9 to 10569 million compared to 10471 million in the previous year the majority of this increase was due to the additional sales stemming from the fourth quarter acquisition of the former unilever oral care business other increases included the effects of foreign exchange of approximately 30 million and the reversal of prior period promotion reserves of approximately 13 million due to a change in estimate these increases were partially offset by the company’s change in revenue recognition policy from fob shipping point to fob destination point which reduced sales by approximately 63 million in 2003 last year’s sales included a similar change in promotion estimate of 53 million as well as the discontinuation of certain former usa detergents cleaners and former carterwallace pet care products of approximately 86 million the impact of such discontinued products was approximately 12 million in 2003 adjusting for acquisitions and discontinued product lines as well as foreign exchange the change in revenue recognition policy and reversal of prior period promotion liabilities sales of existing products were 10325 million in 2003 as compared to 10332 million in 2002

the company’s gross margin increased to 301 from 297 in the prior year this increase in gross margin represents a substantial improvement in the consumer product margin partially offset by a substantial reduction in specialty products the higher consumer products margin was due to the fullyear benefits of the carterwallace integration completed in 2002 as well as additional purchasing manufacturing and distribution efficiencies associated with economies of scale achieved in 2003 partially offset by higher startup costs and promotion expenses associated with new product introductions the lower specialty products margin was primarily due to higher ingredient costs for the animal nutrition business 

  

marketing expenses increased 26 million to 888 million the increase was primarily associated with advertising expenses for personal care products namely higher arm  hammer dentifrice and arrid brands as well as the marketing costs associated with the newly introduced cleaning product brillo scrub n toss partially offset by a reduction in advertising expenses for other personal care products 

  

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 32 million this decreases was primarily a result of the elimination of transition related expenses incurred in 2002 associated with the acquired carterwallace products and tradename impairment charges recorded in 2002 partially offset by higher personnel related expenses 

  

other income and expenses 

  

the increase in equity in earnings of affiliates of 71 million was almost entirely due to the company’s prorata share in the year over year increase in earnings from armkel llc armkel’s earnings increase for the year was primarily a result of a litigation settlement in the second quarter partially offset by an impairment of an asset held for sale for a net contribution to the company of approximately 5 million this increase over the prior year also reflected a strong performance by international operations partially offset by significantly weaker domestic results earnings in 2002 reflected the disproportionate recapture of 5 million of allocated losses sustained in the fourth quarter of 2001 in accordance with the terms of the armkel joint venture agreement see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the prior period increase was also impacted by the inventory stepup charge in the first quarter of 2002 relating to armkel’s opening inventory values the combined results of company’s other equity investments armand products and armakleen were virtually unchanged 

  

investment earnings were lower as a result of lower interest rates on funds invested 

  

interest expense increased 5 million for the year even though there was a significant reduction in average debt outstanding at lower interest rates this is because the company recorded a 49 million charge to write off deferred financing costs related to previous financing transactions and settlement of interest rate swaps 

  

other income and expense includes foreign exchange gains realized by the company’s brazilian subsidiary while 2002 was unfavorably affected by foreign exchange losses incurred by the same subsidiary 

  

taxation 

  

the tax rate for the year was 308 compared to 340 in the previous year this decrease is primarily a result of a settlement of a state tax matter as well as the resolution of other tax contingencies 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

net sales 

  

net sales increased by 874 million or 91 to 10471 million compared to 9597 million in the previous year the majority of this increase was due to the additional sales in consumer products stemming from businesses acquired from carterwallace in the fourth quarter of 2001 amounting to approximately 738 million and additional sales in the specialty products acquisition of biovance products inc of approximately 71 million at the beginning of 2002 adjusting for acquisitions and discontinued product lines as well as the reversal of prior year promotion liabilities of approximately 53 million based on latest estimates sales of existing products increased to 9252 million for 2002 from 9077 million in 2001 

  

operating costs 

  

the company’s gross margin increased to 297 from 291 in the prior year this improvement reflected a significant improvement in laundry products gross margins of 27 points due to the virtually full year benefits of the usa detergents acquisition and the prior year promotion liability adjustment of 53 million partially offset by a reduced gross margin of 39 points on personal care resulting from higher promotional spending related to 2002 sales and higher manufacturing costs associated with the cranbury production of arrid antiperspirant earlier in the year to a lesser extent gross margin was further hampered by approximately 4 million of equipment obsolescence charges related to process improvements at two plants and downsizing and impairment charges at two other plants the startup costs of the madera california animal nutrition facility also negatively impacted gross margin 

  

marketing expenses increased 114 million to 862 million this increase was mainly due to the acquired brands and higher spending in support of deodorizing products partially offset by lower spending on existing personal care products 

  

selling general and administrative expenses increased 87 million higher personnel related expenses and transition expenses associated with acquired products and a 23 million impairment charge related to the tradename valuation of a recently acquired brand name were partially offset by the elimination of goodwill and certain tradename amortization expense associated with the company’s adoption of sfas no 142 

  

other income and expenses 

  

the increase in equity in earnings of affiliates was due to the inclusion of 181 million of allocated full year profits from armkel llc which reflected a disproportionate recapture of 5 million of allocated losses sustained in the fourth quarter of 2001 see footnote 6 for further explanation of armkel’s results the company’s other equity investments armand products and armakleen were virtually unchanged 

  

investment income was slightly lower due to lower interest rates on funds invested 

  

interest expense increased significantly from the prior year as a result of the company carrying the debt used to finance the two significant acquisitions in 2001 

  

other expenses consisted mostly of foreign exchange losses of approximately 2 million associated with the company’s brazilian subsidiary qgn 

  

taxation 

  

the effective tax rate for 2002 was 340 compared to 364 in the previous year the lower rate in 2002 reflected the impact of armkel’s foreign subsidiaries whose posttax results were included in equity in earnings of affiliates partially offset by a higher state tax rate 

  

segment results 

  

current and prior year results by segment are presented based upon segments as described in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

the company has identified its operating segments based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures specifically the company has identified the following segments church  dwight “cd” consumer armkel llc “armkel” cd specialty products division “spd” other equity affiliates includes armand products company “armand” and the armakleen company “armakleen” and corporate 

  

segment revenues are derived from the sale of the following products 

  

   

the company has 50 percent ownership interests in armkel armand and armakleen since the company does not control these entities they are accounted for under the equity method in the consolidated financial statements of the company however they are included in the segment disclosures presented below because the chief operating decision maker regularly reviews their operating results and performance

cd consumer products 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

cd consumer net sales of the company grew 6 to 8690 million for the year including the fourth quarter acquisition of the oral care brands from unilever partially offset by the aforementioned change in revenue recognition policy major factors that impacted comparative product lines performance included a 13 million reversal of prior year promotion reserves due to a change in estimate last year’s sales included a similar change in promotion estimate of 53 million furthermore cd consumer net sales were also lower due to discontinuation of some former usa detergents cleaners and former carterwallace pet care products which impacted the deodorizing and cleaning products line net sales of liquid laundry detergent were significantly higher and more than offset the continuing industry trend of declining powder laundry detergent sales as more and more consumers switch to the liquid form of the product in the laundry products line personal care products aside from the unilever impact were lower in part because of a reduction in gum sales and the discontinued breathcare line 

  

cd consumer income before taxes and minority interest increased 97 million or 155 to 728 million mostly due to an 116 million increase in gross profit with almost half of this increase coming from the acquired unilever brands the remainder of this gross profit improvement was the result of improved laundry product margins as well as lower manufacturing costs for arrid antiperspirant since its relocation to the lakewood plant from the former carterwallace cranbury plant higher marketing expenses of 41 million were mainly in support of the newly introduced cleaning product brillo scrub n toss followed by higher advertising for arrid antiperspirant and arm  hammer dentifrice and partially offset by lower marketing costs for the gum line and the discontinued breathcare line selling general and administrative expenses were 20 million lower because of the elimination of transition related expenses incurred in 2002 associated with the acquired carterwallace products and tradename impairment charges recorded in 2002 partially offset by higher personnel related costs 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

cd consumer net sales of the company grew almost 10 in 2002 to 8641 million as compared to 7869 million in 2001 virtually all of this increase was due to the additional sales stemming from businesses acquired from carterwallace in the fourth quarter of 2001 amounting to approximately 738 million and to a lesser extent the reversal of prior year promotion liabilities of approximately 53 million based on latest estimates 

  

cd consumer income before taxes and minority interest of 631 million in 2002 were flat with 2001 higher gross profit of 320 million resulted from the acquired businesses improved laundry product profit margins of 27 points due to the virtually full year benefits of the usa acquisition the promotion adjustment of prior year reserves of 53 million partially offset by a reduced gross margin of 39 points on existing personal care products from higher promotional spending related to 2002 sales and higher manufacturing costs associated with the cranbury production of arrid antiperspirant earlier in the year to a lesser extent gross profit absorbed approximately 4 million of equipment obsolescence charges related to process improvements at two plants and downsizing and impairment charges at two other plants the marketing expense increase of 107 million over 2001 was mainly due to the acquired brands and higher spending in support of deodorizing products partially offset by lower spending on existing personal care brands selling general and administrative expenses increased 91 million over the prior year as higher personnel related expenses and transition expenses associated with acquired products and a 23 million impairment charge related to a tradename valuation of a recently acquired brand name were partially offset by the elimination of goodwill and certain tradename amortization expense associated with the company’s adoption of sfas 142 furthermore interest expense increased 102 million from the prior year as a result of the company carrying the debt used to finance the two significant acquisitions in 2001 

  

armkel llc 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

armkel’s net sales increased by 269 million or 70 to 4107 million as compared to 3838 million in 2002 this year’s increase was impacted by favorable foreign exchange rates of approximately 191 million offset by the change in revenue recognition of approximately 34 million at the brand level international sales on a constant dollar basis increased 133 million or 76 reflecting higher sales of arm  hammer dentifrice in the united kingdom and mexico higher export sales from the united kingdom the addition of the selsun brand in australia and stronger sales of lineance and nair in france these higher international sales were partially offset by a 26 reduction in domestic sales primarily of first response pregnancy test kits and nair depilatories the latter of which was impacted by weather and competitive factors 

  

armkel’s income before taxes and minority interest of 572 million in 2003 was 217 million higher than the 354 million in 2002 gross profit increased 176 million on the higher sales and a 7 margin improvement reflecting the full year benefits of its operations integration with church  dwight partially offset by startup costs and promotion expenses associated with new product introduction last year’s gross profit included an 81 million acquisitionrelated inventory stepup charge marketing expenses increased 65 million above the prior year and were driven by the lineance launch in the us as well as increased advertising behind arm  hammer dentifrice products and trojan condoms in the uk lineance and nair in france and other initiatives selling general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 80 million mainly due to a 127 million settlement of litigation on pregnancy test kits partially offset by a 31 million impairment charge for an asset held for sale at cranbury nj interest expense was reduced by 21 million on a lower level of average debt outstanding at lower interest rates the combination of higher gross profit higher marketing expenses lower selling general and administrative expenses and lower interest expense resulted in the increase in income before taxes and minority interest in 2003 as compared to 2002 

  

2002 compared to the three months ended december 31 2001 

  

armkel’s net sales increased 3062 million in 2002 to 3838 million from 776 million in 2001 this net sales increase is primarily due to the businesses acquired from carterwallace at the end of september 2001 

  

armkel’s income before taxes of 354 million in 2002 increased from the 154 million loss incurred during the startup in 2001 when among full year activities armkel recognized transition related costs and incurred a 151 million charge for the stepup of opening inventory values established as part of purchase accounting the remaining stepup of opening inventory values of 81 million was charged off in 2002 

  

specialty products 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

specialty products net sales grew 48 million or 26 due to higher specialty chemicals sales which included the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates at its subsidiaries in the united kingdom and brazil partially offset by lower sales of animal nutrition products and the impact from the change in revenue recognition policy 

  

specialty products income before taxes and minority interest decreased by 11 million to 155 million for the year this is mainly a result of a 37 million decrease in gross profit due to higher manufacturing costs in certain animal nutrition and specialty chemical products particularly a palm oil derivative used in animal nutrition lower gross profit along with lower marketing expenses of 15 million mostly in the animal nutrition products combined with flat year over year selling general and administrative expenses and a 7 million reduction in interest expense 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

specialty products net sales grew 102 million or 59 to 1830 million in 2002 from 1728 million in 2001 largely as a result of the acquisition of biovance technologies inc of approximately 71 million at the beginning of 2002 

  

specialty products income before taxes and minority interest declined by 34 million reflecting a negative impact to gross profit stemming from the startup costs of the new madera california animal nutrition facility for the production of megalac rumen bypass fats and related highervalue megalac products for the west coast dairy feed additives market gross profit was also negatively impacted by higher raw material costs for megalac related products these gross profit decreases were mainly offset by a higher gross profit contribution from the addition of the biovance acquisition a higher gross profit of approximately 14 million together with the biovance acquisition helped to drive higher marketing expenses of approximately 7 million higher selling general and administrative expenses of approximately 12 million and higher interest costs of 22 million 

  

other equity affiliates 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

other equity affiliates net sales of armand products company and armakleen company increased by 31 million to 489 million with the increase being almost equally split between the two companies 

  

other equity affiliates income before taxes and minority interest were slightly ahead of the prior year reflecting better gross profit margins on the armakleen cleaning businesses higher net sales offset by lower gross margins on the armand products net sales because of a mix change toward more export business as the video glass industry in the us continues to experience rapid dislocation 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

other equity affiliates net sales of armand products company and armakleen company decreased by 7 million to 457 million in 2002 from 2001 largely because of lower armakleen sales 

  

other equity affiliates income before taxes and minority interest decreased 3 million on the lower net sales resulting in a reduction in gross profit of 9 million which was partially offset by a 5 million reduction in selling general and administrative expenses principally resulting from an armakleen reorganization in 2001 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the company had outstanding total debt of 3970 million and cash of 756 million for a net debt position of 3214 million at december 31 2003 this compares to 2921 million at december 31 2002 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2001 the company financed its investment in armkel the acquisition of usa detergents and the antiperspirant and pet care businesses from carterwallace with a 510 million credit facility consisting of a 125 million five year term loan term loan a a 285 million six year term loan term loan b and a 100 million revolving credit facility the entire amount of the term loans was drawn at closing and the revolving credit facility remains fully undrawn term loan a paid interest at 200 basis points over libor and term loan b pays interest at 250 basis points over libor with interest rates determined based on the ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the company’s loan agreement “adjusted ebitda” the term loan a was paid off in full during the first half of 2003 primarily from the proceeds of the receivables purchase agreement and operating cash flows 

  

on october 20 2003 the company completed its purchase of four oral care brands from unilever in the united states and canada the acquisition was funded by obtaining new tranche b term loans through an amendment to the company’s credit agreement dated september 28 2001 as well as available cash in connection with the amendment the company was provided with new tranche b term loans in the amount of 250 million which were used to replace the existing tranche b term loans of approximately 150 million and used the remaining 100 million to fund the unilever transaction the new tranche b loans which have essentially the same terms as the replaced loans but with more favorable interest rate provisions at 225 basis points over libor repayable in approximately 06 million quarterly installments through september 2006 and thereafter in substantial quarterly installments until september 2007 when the loan is fully paid as a result of the refinancing the company wroteoff the balance of the deferred financing costs associated with the previous financing in the fourth quarter of 2003 

  

during the first quarter of 2003 the company entered into a receivables purchase agreement with an issuer of receivablesbacked commercial paper in order to refinance a portion 60 million of its primary credit facility the transaction resulted in a reclassification of longterm debt to shortterm debt in the company’s consolidated balance sheet under this arrangement the company sold and will sell from time to time throughout the 3 year term of the agreement its trade accounts receivable to a whollyowned consolidated special purpose finance subsidiary harrison street funding llc a delaware limited liability company “harrison” harrison in turn sold and will sell on an ongoing basis to the commercial paper issuer an undivided interest in the pool of accounts receivable the receivables assets and the shortterm borrowings of harrison are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company the transactions were entered into to reduce certain expenses associated with the credit facility in addition to lowering the company’s financing costs by accessing the commercial paper market the balance outstanding under the agreement was 563 million at december 31 2003 

  

in early august of 2003 the company refinanced 100 million of its term loan bank debt principally through the sale of 100 million principal amount of 525 convertible senior debentures due on august 15 2033 through a private placement to qualified institutional buyers the debentures rank equal in right of payment with all of the company’s existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness the debentures are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of the company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness and to all of the existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the company’s subsidiaries the company has the right to repurchase all or part of the debentures on or after august 15 2008 interest is paid semiannually on august 15 th and february 15 th of each year 

  

on each of august 15 2010 august 15 2013 august 15 2018 august 15 2023 and august 15 2028 or in the event of a change in control holders may require the company to repurchase all or any portion of the debentures at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase the company must pay cash for any debentures repurchased on august 15 2010 however the company may choose to pay cash shares of its common stock or a combination of cash of shares of its common stock for any debentures repurchased on august 15 2013 august 15 2018 august 15 2023 or august 15 2028 or following a change in control 

  

holders may convert their debentures into shares of the company’s common stock prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 215054 shares of common stock per each 1000 principal amount of debentures which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 4650 per share subject to adjustment in certain circumstances the initial conversion price represents a 4216 premium over the closing price of the company’s common stock on august 5 2003 which was 3271 per share a holder may convert the debentures into the company’s common stock under the following circumstances the sale price of the company’s common stock is more that 120 of the conversion price the “20 conversion price premium” the trading price of a debenture falls below a specified threshold specified credit rating events with respect to the debentures occur the company calls the debentures for redemption or specified corporate transactions occur 

  

because of the inclusion of the restricted convertibility feature of the debentures the company’s diluted net income per common share calculation does not give effect to the dilution from the conversion of the debentures until the company’s share price exceeds the 20 conversion price premium or one of the other events described above occurs 

  

the issuance of debentures is reflected on the company’s statement of cash flow opposite the captions of proceeds from longterm borrowings and deferred financing costs 

  

adjusted ebitda is a required component of the financial covenants contained in the company’s primary credit facility and management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda is useful to investors as a financial indicator of the company’s ability to service its indebtedness adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states financial covenants include a total debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio which if not met could result in an event of default and trigger the early termination of the credit facility if not remedied within a certain period of time adjusted ebitda was approximately 151 million for the full year 2003 the leverage ratio total debt to adjusted ebitda at december 31 2003 per the loan agreement was approximately 258 versus the agreement’s maximum 300 and the interest coverage ratio was approximately 613 versus the agreement’s minimum of 475 this credit facility is secured by a blanket lien on all of the company’s assets the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to the company’s key liquidity measure adjusted ebitda is as follows in millions 

  

   

during 2003 cash flow from operating activities was 1179 million major factors contributing to the cash flow from operating activities included operating earnings before noncash charges for depreciation and amortization a decrease in working capital in particular inventory partially offset by the net noncash impact from the equity in earnings of affiliates operating cash flow together with the aforementioned new bank borrowing activity the issuance of convertible debt and proceeds obtained through a receivables purchase agreement described herein were used to fund the investing activities to acquire the oral care brands from unilever and to pay for additions to property plant and equipment remaining cash was used to make both voluntary and mandatory debt repayments and the proceeds from stock options exercised helped to pay cash dividends 

  

in 2002 operating cash flow was 1138 million major factors contributing to the cash flow from operating activities included operating earnings before noncash charges for depreciation and amortization and a significant reduction in working capital particularly inventories offset by the net noncash impact from the equity in earnings of affiliates operating cash flow was used for additions to property plant and equipment and to consummate the acquisition of biovance operating cash together with proceeds from stock options exercised and a collected note receivable were used to make both voluntary and mandatory debt repayments and to pay cash dividends 

  

commitments as of december 31 2003 

  

the table below summarizes the company’s material contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2003 

  

       

the company generally relies on operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings to meet its financing requirements our diverse product offerings strong brand names and market positions have provided a stable base of cash flow our diverse product line is marketed through multiple distribution channels reducing our dependence on any one category or type of customer similar to other basic consumer products we believe that consumers purchase our products largely independent of economic cycles however the company’s ability to meet its financial obligations depends on successful financial and operating performance the company cannot guarantee that its business strategy will succeed or that it will achieve the anticipated financial results the company’s financial and operational performance depends upon a number of factors many of which are beyond its control these factors include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the company cannot give assurance that it will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that it will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all its obligations including those noted above if the company is unable to pay its obligations it will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies such as selling assets refinancing or restructuring indebtedness or raising additional equity capital however the company cannot give assurance that any alternative strategies will be feasible or prove adequate to satisfy its obligation 

  

the company has a total debttocapital ratio of approximately 48 at december 31 2003 the company had 100 million of additional domestic borrowing capacity available through its revolving credit agreement capital expenditures in 2004 are expected to be moderately lower than the level of the prior year management believes that operating cash flow coupled with the company’s access to credit markets will be sufficient to meet the anticipated cash requirements for the coming year 

  

armkel 

  

the armkel venture was initially financed with 229 million in equity contributions of which approximately 112 million was contributed by the company and an additional 445 million of debt 

  

armkel llc had outstanding longterm debt of 367 million and cash less shortterm debt of 69 million for a net debt position of 298 million at yearend in addition armkel had unused revolving credit bank lines of 85 million any debt on armkel’s balance sheet is without recourse to the company 

  

under the terms of its joint venture agreement with kelso the company has a call option to acquire kelso’s interest in armkel in three to five years after the closing at fair market value as defined in the agreement subject to a floor and a cap if the company does not exercise its call option then kelso may request the company to purchase its interest if the company elects not to purchase kelso’s interest then kelso’s and the company’s equity in the joint venture may be offered to a third party if such a sale should occur depending on the proceeds received the company may be required to make a payment to kelso up to an amount of approximately 112 million kelso also may elect to have the company purchase its interest for 112 million this amount is not payable until the eighth year from the formation of the venture finally kelso may require the company to purchase its interest upon a change in control as defined in the joint venture agreement the venture’s board has equal representation from both the company and kelso 

  

if the company were to exercise its call option it would likely incur additional debt however that decision would be made only after a number of financing alternatives were considered 

  

other items 

  

market risk 

  

concentration of risk 

  

a group of three cd consumer customers accounted for approximately 26 of consolidated net sales in 2003 including a single customer walmart which accounted for approximately 17 a group of three cd consumer customers accounted for approximately 23 of consolidated net sales in 2002 including walmart which accounted for approximately 16 this group accounted for 23 in 2001 

  

as part of the usa detergents merger agreement the company divested usa detergents nonlaundry business and other noncore assets to former usa detergents executives under the new company name of usa metro inc “usam” subsequently renamed usa detergents “usad” 

  

the company has a concentration of risk with usad at december 31 2003 in the form of trade accounts receivable and an amount due for leased space of approximately 32 million a 16 equity interest in usad of 04 million and a note receivable for other assets of 20 millionpayments start with the beginning of 2006 this note has a carrying value of approximately 14 million using an effective interest rate of 17 

  

should usad be unable to meet these obligations the impact would have an adverse effect on the company’s consolidated statement of income 

  

interest rate risk 

  

the company’s primary domestic borrowing facility is made up of a  510 million amended credit agreement of which 2300 million remained outstanding as of december 31 2003 and 100 million of a revolving credit agreement all of which was undrawn at december 31 2003 the company entered into a receivables purchase agreement with the issuer of receivablesbacked commercial paper in order to refinance a portion of its primary borrowing facility the balance outstanding under this agreement was 563 million at december 31 2003 during the third quarter of 2003 the company also refinanced 100 million of its primary borrowing facility through the sale of 100 million principal amount of 525 fixed rate convertible senior debentures due on august 15 2033 the weighted average interest rate on all these borrowings at december 31 2003 excluding deferred financing costs and commitment fees was approximately 37 including the effect of hedges the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on this debt as required by the credit agreement the swap agreements are contracts to exchange floating rate for fixed interest rate payments periodically over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts as of december 31 2003 the company entered into agreements for a notional amount of 56 million swapping debt with a one month libor rate for a fixed rate that averages 40 as a result the swap agreements eliminate the variability of interest expense for that portion of the company’s debt on an annualized basis a drop of 10 in interest rates would result in a 4 million payment under the swap agreement in excess of what would have been paid based on the variable rate however a 10 increase in interest rates would result in a 3 million increase in interest expense on the debt not hedged 

  

the company’s domestic operations and its brazilian subsidiary have other short and long term debts that are floating rate obligations if the floating rate were to change by 10 from the december 31 2003 level annual interest expense associated with the floating rate debt would be immaterial 

  

foreign currency 

  

the company is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily us dollarbritish pound us dollarcanadian dollar and us dollarbrazilian real 

  

the company from time to time enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated but not yet committed sales denominated in the canadian dollar the british pound and the japanese yen the terms of these contracts are for periods of under 12 months the purpose of the company’s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the company from the risk that the eventual dollar net cash inflows from the sale of products to foreign customers will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates the company did not have any forward exchange contracts outstanding at december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 

  

the company is also subject to translation exposure of the company’s foreign subsidiary’s financial statements a hypothetical 10 change in the exchange rates for the us dollar to the canadian dollar the british pound and the brazilian real from those at december 31 2003 and 2002 would result in an annual currency translation gain or loss of approximately 5 million in 2003 and 3 million in 2002 

  

equity derivatives 

  

the company has entered into equity derivative contracts of its own stock in order to minimize the impact on earnings resulting from fluctuations in market price of shares in the company’s deferred compensation plan these contracts which consist of cash settled call options in the amount of 185000 shares hedge approximately 50 of the shares related to the plan and are marked to market through earnings as a result the company recognized income of approximately 15 million in 2003 and 4 million in 2002 which reduced the charge for deferred compensation 

  

related party transactions 

  

the company has achieved substantial synergies by combining certain of its operations with those of armkel particularly in the areas of sales manufacturing and distribution and most service functions armkel has retained its core marketing research  development and financial planning capabilities and continues to manufacture condoms but purchases virtually all the support services it requires for its us domestic business from the company under a management services agreement which has a term of five years with possible renewal 

  

during 2003 the company invoiced armkel 244 million for administrative services purchased 19 million of deodorant antiperspirant inventory produced by armkel at its cost and sold 29 million of arm  hammer products that were sold in international markets the company has an open receivable from armkel at december 31 2003 of approximately 67 million that primarily related to administrative services 

  

as noted in the concentration of risk section of this exhibit the company divested usa detergents nonlaundry business and other noncore assets to former usa detergents executives concurrent with the merger agreement the company has a 16 ownership interest in the newly formed company usad the company supplies usad with certain laundry and cleaning products it produces to meet the needs of the markets usad is in at cost plus a markup in addition the company leases manufacturing and office space to usad under a separate agreement 

  

during 2003 the company sold 218 million of laundry and cleaning products to usad furthermore the company billed usad 5 million and usad billed the company 2 million for leased space for open amounts receivable at december 31 2003 see concentration of risk section on page 28 

  

the company’s only financial interest in armkel and usad is the company’s direct equity investments in armkel and usad the company has no relationship with the other equity holders of armkel and usad respectively for this reason the company believes it has no incentive to negotiate with either armkel or usad in a manner that is not in the best interests of its stockholders generally

competitive environment 

  

many of our competitors are large companies including the procter  gamble company unilever inc the clorox company colgatepalmolive company and sc johnson  son inc which have greater financial resources than the company these companies have the capacity to outspend the company in an attempt to gain market share 

  

because of the competitive environment facing retailers the company faces pricing pressure from these customers particularly the highvolume retail store customers who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms these concessions or terms could reduce the company’s margins furthermore if the company is unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to its trade customers the customers could increase product purchases from our competitors which would harm the company’s sales and profitability 

  

consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced such as laundry and household cleaning products are subject to significant price competition from time to time the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share 

  

the company has entered the oral care and personal care and deodorizing businesses using the unique strengths of its arm  hammer trademark and baking soda technology these are highly innovative markets characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and requiring heavy advertising and promotion 

  

in the toothpaste category after leading its category in growth several years ago driven by the success of arm  hammer advance white toothpaste the company’s share dropped in both 2002 and 2003 mainly as a result of competitive new products and aggressive spending by other manufacturers in the category 

  

in the personal care category several new products and line extensions in oral care were expanded during the final quarter of 2001 in particular arm  hammer advance breath care a line of oral deodorization products including mouthwash mints and toothpaste this oral care line of products did not live up to our expectations in 2002 and 2003 particularly since key retailers started moving away from mints and therapeutic gums in the oral care aisle of the store because this trend cannot be halted or reversed this particular line of products is being discontinued 

  

in 2003 the company announced several new consumer product initiatives early in 2003 the company launched arrid total soft solid antiperspirants targeted primarily to women and broadened its arm  hammer ultramax antiperspirant line by adding a gel primarily targeted at men to strengthen its toothpaste franchise the company introduced arm  hammer complete care the first arm  hammer allinone toothpaste in the laundry area the company launched arm  hammer fresh ‘n soft liquid fabric softener as a companion product to the existing fabric softener dryer sheets these products all reached broad national distribution during the second quarter in addition beginning in the second quarter the company launched brillo scrub ‘n toss a disposable cleaning pad and the company’s first major extension to the brillo line these introductions usually involve heavy marketing costs in the year of launch and the eventual success of these new product and line extensions will not be known for some time 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2003 the company completed the national distribution of arm  hammer ® easy flush clumping cat litter a major new addition to its cat litter line the company also repackaged its xtra liquid laundry detergent line in vibrant new bottle colors cued to the product’s fragrance variants and expanded distribution of this product line in the mass channel 

  

early in 2004 the company launched arm  hammer enamel care toothpaste its most important oral care innovation in several years enamel care is based on proprietary formulation and packaging technology which combines the cleaning and whitening properties of baking soda with fluoride and patented liquid calcium in a dual chamber tube to fill tooth surfaces and restore enamel luster the product is available in two variants advanced cleaning and natural whitening in addition the entire arm  hammer toothpaste line has been restaged with new packaging graphics designed to return the brand to its original emphasis on therapeutic benefits other important personal care initiatives early in 2004 include additions to the arrid total and arm  hammer ultramax antiperspirant lines 

  

in the specialty products business competition within the two major product categories sodium bicarbonate and potassium carbonate remained intense in 2003 sodium bicarbonate sales have been negatively impacted for several years by nahcolitebased sodium bicarbonate manufacturers as for potassium carbonate the company expects imports of video glass and production from foreign suppliers to affect us demand in 2004 as it did in 2003 

  

during the year the company continued to pursue opportunities to build a specialized industrial cleaning business using our aqueousbased technology in early 1999 the company extended its alliance with safetykleen corp to build a specialty cleaning products business based on our technology and their sales and distribution organization the second year of this alliance was impacted by safetykleen’s financial difficulties leading to a chapter 11 filing in june of 2000 and a major reorganization implemented during the second half of that year since then safetykleen corp has emerged from its bankruptcy in 2003 while this opportunity has demonstrated more stability in 2003 and continues to hold great promise the outcome will not be known for some time

certain risks and uncertainties related to the companys business

      the companys future results and financial condition are dependent upon
its ability to develop manufacture and market consumer and specialty products
successfully inherent in this process are a number of factors that the company
must successfully manage to achieve favorable future operating results and
financial condition in addition to the other information contained in this
annual report on form 10k the following risks and uncertainties could affect
the companys future operating results and financial condition

     the company has recently developed and commenced sales of a number of new
      products which if they do not gain widespread customer acceptance or if
      they cannibalize sales of existing products could harm the companys
      efforts to improve its financial performance

      the company has introduced a number of new consumer products the
development and introduction of new products involves substantial research
development and marketing expenditures which the company may be unable to
recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance in
addition if the new products merely cannibalize sales of existing products the
companys financial performance could be harmed

     the company may discontinue products or product lines which could result
      in returns asset writeoffs and shut down costs

      in the past the company has discontinued certain products and product
lines which resulted in returns from customers asset writeoffs and shut down
costs the company may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the
extent it discontinues products that do not meet expectations or no longer
satisfy consumer demand product returns writeoffs or shut down costs would
reduce cash flow and earnings product efficacy or safety concerns could result
in product recalls or declining sales which would reduce cash flow and earnings

     the company faces intense competition in a mature industry that may
      require it to increase expenditures and accept lower profit margins to
      preserve or maintain its market share unless the markets in which the
      company competes grow substantially a loss of market share will result in
      reduced sales levels and declining operating results

      currently 92 of our sales are generated in us markets us markets
for consumer products are mature and characterized by high household
penetration particularly with respect to the companys most significant product



                                                                               9

categories including laundry detergents and deodorizers and household cleaning
products the companys unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on
increasing usage by consumers product innovation and capturing market share
from competitors the company may not be able to succeed in implementing its
strategies to increase domestic revenues

      the consumer products industry particularly the laundry detergent
personal care and air deodorizer categories is intensely competitive to
protect the companys existing market share or to capture increased market
share the company may need to increase expenditures for promotions and
advertising and introduce and establish new products increased expenditures may
not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing the companys market share and
could result in lower sales and profits

      many of the companys competitors are substantially larger companies
including the procter  gamble company unilever inc the clorox company
colgatepalmolive company and sc johnson  son inc which have greater
financial resources than the company they have the capacity to outspend the
company in an attempt to take market share from the company

     providing price concessions or trade terms that are acceptable to the
      companys trade customers or the failure to do so could adversely affect
      the companys sales and profitability in addition reductions in
      inventory by the companys trade customers including as a result of
      consolidations in the retail industry or a shift in the importance of
      certain channels of trade could adversely affect its sales

      consumer products particularly those that are valuepriced like many of
the companys products are subject to significant price competition and in
recent years have been characterized by price deflation from time to time the
company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to
competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share any reduction
in prices to respond to these pressures would harm profit margins in addition
if the companys sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction
in margins its results of operations would suffer

      because of the competitive environment facing retailers many of the
companys trade customers particularly its highvolume retail store customers
have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms
these concessions or terms could reduce the companys margins further if the
company is unable to maintain price or trade terms that are acceptable to its
trade customers they could reduce product purchases from the company and
increase product purchases from the companys competitors which would harm the
companys sales and profitability in addition from time to time the companys
retail customers have reduced inventory levels in managing their working capital
requirements any reduction in inventory levels by the companys retail
customers would harm its operating results in particular continued
consolidation within the retail industry could potentially reduce inventory
levels maintained by the companys retail customers which could adversely
impact its results of operations the companys performance is also dependent
upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in
particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and
by the financial difficulties of retailers including the ongoing bankruptcy
proceedings involving kmart

      industry wide consumer products such as those marketed by the company are
increasingly being sold in club stores and mass merchandisers while sales of
consumer products by food and drug stores are comprising a smaller proportion of
the total volume of consumer products sold sales of the companys products are
stronger in the food and drug channels of trade and not as strong with the club
stores and mass merchandisers although the company has taken steps to improve
its representation in club stores and mass merchandisers if the company is not
successful in doing so and the current trend continues the financial condition
and operating results of the company could suffer

     loss of any of the companys principal customers could significantly
      decrease its sales and profitability

      walmart including its affiliate sams club was the companys largest
customer accounting for 16 of net sales in 2002 14 of net sales in 2001 and
13 of net sales in 2000 the loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of
purchases by walmart or any of the companys other top customers would harm the
companys sales and profitability

     the company may make acquisitions that if not properly integrated or if
      otherwise unsuccessful could strain or divert its resources


                                                                              10
page
      the company has made several acquisitions in the past few years and may
make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary
businesses or products in the future any future acquisitions or investments
would entail various risks including the difficulty of assimilating the
operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products the potential
disruption of the companys ongoing business and generally the companys
potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from
the acquisition or investment these factors could harm the companys financial
condition and operating results any future acquisitions or investments could
result in substantial cash expenditures the issuance of new equity in the
company and the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities in
addition any potential acquisitions or investments whether or not they are
ultimately completed could divert the attention of management and other
resources from other issues that are more critical to the companys operations

     the condom product line of the companys armkel joint venture could suffer
      if the spermicide n9 is proved or perceived to be harmful

      armkels distribution of condoms under the trojan and other trademarks is
regulated by the us food and drug administration fda certain of armkels
condoms contain the spermicide nonoxynol9 n9 the world health organization
and other interested groups have issued reports suggesting that n9 should not
be used rectally or for multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse given the
ingredients potential to cause irritation to human membranes the company
expects the fda to issue nonbinding draft guidance concerning the labeling of
condoms with n9 although the timing of such draft guidance is uncertain the
company believes that condoms with n9 provide an acceptable added means of
contraceptive protection and is cooperating with the fda concerning the
appropriate labeling revisions if any however the company cannot predict the
outcome of the fda review if the fda or state governments promulgate rules
which prohibit or restrict the use of n9 in condoms such as new labeling
requirements armkel could incur costs from obsolete products packaging or raw
materials and sales of condoms could decline which in turn could decrease the
value of the companys interest in armkel

      related to this issue on february 28 2003 a purported class action suit
lissette velez v church  dwight co inc et al was filed against the
company and armkel and two other condom manufacturers in the superior court of
new jersey the lawsuit alleges that condoms lubricated with n9 are being
marketed in a misleading manner because the makers of such condoms claim they
aid in the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases whereas according to the
plaintiffs public health organizations have found that n9 usage can under some
circumstances increase the risk of transmission of disease condoms with n9
have been marketed for many years as a cleared medical device under applicable
fda regulations however the company cannot predict the outcome of this
litigation

      raw materials and sources of supply

      the company manufactures sodium bicarbonate for both of its consumer and
industrial businesses at two of its plants located at green river wyoming and
old fort ohio

      the production of sodium bicarbonate requires two basic raw materials
soda ash and carbon dioxide the primary source of soda ash used by the company
is the mineral trona which is found in abundance in southwestern wyoming near
the companys green river plant the company had acquired a number of leases
allowing it to extract these trona deposits in january 1999 the company sold
most of these leases to solvay minerals inc the company retains adequate trona
reserves to support the requirements of the sodium bicarbonate business and may
acquire other leases in the future as the need arises

      the company is party to a partnership agreement with general chemical
corporation which mines and processes certain trona reserves owned by each of
the two companies in wyoming through the partnership and related supply and
services agreements the company obtains a substantial amount of its soda ash
requirements enabling the company to achieve some of the economies of an
integrated business capable of producing sodium bicarbonate and related products
from the basic raw material the company also has an agreement for the supply of
soda ash from another company

detergent powder employing a process utilizing raw materials readily available

in the companys syracuse new york plant this line was capable of producing
virtually all of the companys liquid laundry detergent requirements the
company when necessary would utilize a contract manufacturer to meet higher

acquisition all of the companys liquid laundry detergent production was
shifted to former usa detergents plants the syracuse plant was shut down at
the end of the first quarter 2001 these plants have enough capacity to produce

significant supply problems armkel generally has two or more suppliers for
production materials although there are multiple providers of their raw
materials in certain instances armkel chose to sole source certain raw
materials in order to gain favorable pricing

largest single  business  arm  hammer baking soda remains the leading brand of
baking  soda  in  terms  of  consumer  recognition  of the  brand  name  and its
reputation for quality and value

     the deodorizing properties of baking soda have since led to the development
