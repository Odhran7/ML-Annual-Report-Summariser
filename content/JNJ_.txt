johnson  johnson and its subsidiaries the company have approximately 141700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field the company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and wellbeing 

the products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– segments of business – consumer health” “– pharmaceutical” and “– medical devices” however the principal markets products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture the products sold in international business include those developed in the us and by subsidiaries abroad 

investments and activities in some countries outside the us are subject to higher risks than comparable us activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to the companys business are generally readily available from multiple sources where there are exceptions the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company 

patents 

the companys subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible they own or are licensed under a significant number of patents in the us and other countries relating to their products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the company in the operation of its businesses the company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products significant legal proceedings and 



claims involving the companys patent and other intellectual property are described in note 19 “legal proceedings— intellectual property” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

  

sales of the company’s largest product stelara ® ustekinumab accounted for approximately 97 of the companys total revenues for fiscal 2021 accordingly the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the company janssen biotech inc a whollyowned subsidiary of johnson  johnson owns patents specifically related to stelara ®  the latest expiring united states composition of matter patent expires in 2023 the latest expiring european composition of matter patent expires in 2024 

sales of the company’s second largest product collectively darzalex ® daratumumab and darzalex faspro ® daratumumab and hyaluronidasefihj accounted for approximately 64 of the companys total revenues for fiscal 2021 accordingly the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the company genmab as owns two patent families related to darzalex ®  and janssen biotech inc has an exclusive license to those patent families the two patent families both expire in the united states in 2029 the latest expiring licensed european patent expires in 2032 janssen biotech inc owns a separate patent portfolio related to darzalex faspro ®  

trademarks 

the company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means these trademarks are protected by registration in the us and other countries where such products are marketed the company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses 

seasonality 

worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for advertising and research and development activity 

competition 

in all of their product lines the companys subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved competition in research both internally and externally sourced involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the development of new and innovative products as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the company’s product portfolio is important to the companys success in all areas of its business the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research in addition the development and maintenance of customer demand for the company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion 

environment 

the company is subject to a variety of us and international environmental protection measures the company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations the company’s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures cash flows earnings or competitive position 

regulation 

the company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement the company is subject to costly and complex us and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and business operations in the us the drug device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies primarily as to product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the us food and drug administration the us fda continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for us fda approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the us the new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation 

the regulatory agencies under whose purview the company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases the company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 

the us fda and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities if the us fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our drugs or medical 



devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the us fda could ban such products detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products order a recall repair replacement or refund of such products refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports andor require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the us fda may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis or enjoin andor restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law the us fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business 

  

the costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world in the us attention has been focused by states regulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or to recommend use or purchase particular medical devices laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry there is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and healthcare providers various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and beginning with disclosures in 2022 to certain nonphysician practitioners federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require strict compliance with antibribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of healthcare generally 

  

us government actors continue efforts to repeal modify or invalidate provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act the aca which passed in 2010 for example federal legislation repealed the aca’s individual mandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employersponsored healthcare plans the center for medicare  medicaid services cms began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered by medicaid expansion plans certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended and certain shortterm insurance plans not offering the full array of aca benefits have been allowed to extend in duration some of these changes are being challenged in us courts and so their longterm impact remains uncertain the aca has also been subject to judicial challenge in november 2020 the us supreme court heard argument in texas v azar  which challenges the constitutionality of the aca pending resolution of the litigation all of the aca but the individual mandate to buy health insurance remains in effect the us government also continues to propose and implement changes to the medicare part d benefit including the size of manufacturer discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of the benefit there are a number of additional bills pending in congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would affect drug pricing in the medicare and medicaid programs this changing federal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the us healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal law and potential modification or repeal of these laws will ultimately affect the industry 

in addition business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the us by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

further the company relies on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from the covid19 pandemic and brexit that may affect sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in the companys products these processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals 

the global regulatory landscape is also subject to change as the covid19 pandemic continues to affect the us and global economies the us fda and other health authorities have shifted resources and priorities to meet the many challenges presented by the pandemic pandemicrelated disruptions could negatively impact the processing of regulatory submissions and slow agency review times necessary for the approval or clearance of new drugs and devices the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in the company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties the company seeks to identify manage and mitigate risks to our business but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and many are outside of the company’s control and cannot therefore be eliminated in addition to the other information in this report and the company’s other filings with the sec investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties if known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize the company’s business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected potentially in a material way 

risks related to our business industry and operations 

the company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the company’s earnings 

the company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets the company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of costeffectiveness technological innovations intellectual property rights product performance real or perceived product advantages pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement the company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the company competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products andor their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the company could negatively impact sales of the company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development 

for the company’s pharmaceutical businesses loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product for the company’s medical devices businesses technological innovation product quality reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness development by other companies of new or improved products processes and technologies could threaten to make the company’s products or technologies less desirable less economical or obsolete the company’s consumer health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers’ privatelabel brands if the company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products 

interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the company’s business sales and reputation 

the company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex highquality components and materials the company’s subsidiaries operate 85 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from thousands of suppliers around the world the company has in the past and may in the future face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action production quality deviations or safety issues labor disputes labor shortages sitespecific incidents such as fires natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events raw material shortages political unrest terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage 

the company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products any failure by or loss of a thirdparty manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs which may adversely affect our business 

the company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products we depend on these thirdparty manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices however we cannot guarantee that these thirdparty manufacturers will be able to meet our nearterm or longterm manufacturing requirements which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business 

other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance misappropriation of the company’s intellectual property limited ability to manage our inventory possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us moreover if any of our thirdparty manufacturers suffers any damage to facilities loses benefits under material agreements experiences power outages encounters financial difficulties is unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency the company may experience significant business disruption in the event of any such disruption the 



company would need to seek and source other qualified thirdparty manufacturers likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely 

counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues earnings reputation and business 

our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the internet third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards to distributors and patients counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured – often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as the lack of regulation of their contents 

the industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products potentially resulting in lost sales product recalls and an increased threat of litigation in addition diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the company’s business and could cause disruptions or future impact to the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to risks associated with global health crises epidemics and pandemics including the global outbreak of coronavirus and its variants covid19 the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is expected to continue to adversely impact certain aspects of the company’s business results of operations and financial condition including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products the spread of covid19 has caused the company to modify its business practices including instituting remote work for many of the company’s employees and the company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the company determines are in the best interests of our patients customers employees and business partners the company continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of covid19 these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain 

while the us and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies the extent to which covid19 will impact the company’s future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence including the duration of the outbreak and impact of variants any resurgence in covid19 could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease the continued global spread of covid19 could adversely impact the company’s operations including among other things our manufacturing operations supply chain including thirdparty suppliers sales and marketing and clinical trial operations any of these factors could adversely affect the company’s business financial results and global economic conditions generally 

we also face uncertainties related to our covid19 vaccine including uncertainties related to the risk that our continued development programs may not be successful commercially viable or receive approval from regulatory authorities risks associated with clinical trial and realworld data including further analyses of its efficacy safety and durability the risk that data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments including during the peer reviewpublication process in the scientific community generally and by national immunization technical advisory groups nitags and regulatory authorities disruptions in the relationships between us our thirdparty suppliers and external manufacturers the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any such products the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our rd and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide additional research funding for potential drug development related to covid19 the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis that we may continue to experience manufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods indicated and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program and pricing and access challenges for such products including in the us 

in addition to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section and those incorporated by reference herein i ncluding risks relating to the company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in consumption as well as changes in laws relating to supply of the company’s products  given that developments concerning the covid19 pandemic have been constantly evolving additional impacts and risks may arise including litigation that are not presently known to the company 



risks related to government regulation and legal proceedings 

global sales in the company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures 

sales of the company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices products are significantly affected by reimbursements by thirdparty payers such as government healthcare programs private insurance plans and managed care organizations as part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed in the us increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers could result in further pricing pressures in addition increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures outside the us numerous major markets including the eu united kingdom japan and china have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and in that regard directly or indirectly impose price controls limit access to or reimbursement for the company’s products or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection 

the company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses fines and reputational damage 

in the ordinary course of business johnson  johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as product liability patent disputes and claims that their product sales marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust unfair trade practices andor consumer protection laws the company’s more significant legal proceedings are described in note 19 “legal proceedings” under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report litigation in general and securities derivative action class action and multidistrict litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs may involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several years for example the company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc primarily johnson’s ® baby powder and the company’s sale manufacturing and marketing of opioids while the company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation the company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters potentially in excess of accruals including matters where the company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants the resolution of or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period the company does not purchase thirdparty product liability insurance however the company utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits 

product reliability safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations lead to litigation and cause reputational damage 

concerns about product safety whether raised internally or by litigants regulators or consumer advocates and whether or not based on scientific evidence can result in safety alerts product recalls governmental investigations regulatory action on the part of the us food and drug administration or its counterpart in other countries private claims and lawsuits payment of fines and settlements declining sales and reputational damage these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image brand equity and consumer trust in the company’s products product recalls have in the past and could in the future prompt government investigations and inspections the shutdown of manufacturing facilities continued product shortages and related sales declines significant remediation costs reputational damage possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution 

the company faces significant regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the company to government investigations legal actions and penalties 

like other companies in the healthcare industry the company is subject to extensive regulation investigations and legal action by national state and local government agencies in the us and other countries in which it operates regulatory issues regarding compliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries by manufacturers of drugs devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties product recalls product shortages interruptions in production delays in new product approvals and litigation in addition the marketing pricing and sale of the company’s products are subject to regulation investigations and legal actions including under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the medicaid rebate program federal and state false claims acts state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws scrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the us and any resulting investigations and prosecutions carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including but not limited to debarment from participation in government healthcare programs any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations the most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in note 19 “legal proceedings—government proceedings” under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 



changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the company’s operating results 

changes in tax laws or regulations around the world including in the us and as led by the organization for economic cooperation and development could negatively impact the company’s effective tax rate and results of operations a change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would result in the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted this change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted 

see note 8 “income taxes” under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information 

the company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities in connection with various government initiatives companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves however any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the company’s expectations which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves 

risks related to our intellectual property 

the company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business 

the company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products and manufacturing processes these rights are essential to the company’s businesses and materially important to the company’s results of operations public policy both within and outside the us has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights the company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the united states and other important markets or that such protections once granted will last as long as originally anticipated 

competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation interferences oppositions and other proceedings such as inter partes review ipr proceedings before the united states patent  trademark office uspto these proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable in addition challenges that the company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in an injunction andor the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question 

the company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products in the us manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity or claim noninfringement of innovator products through the abbreviated new drug application or anda process with the us fda and related anda litigation the biologics price competition and innovation act bpcia enacted in 2010 which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the us fda of biosimilar alternatives to innovatordeveloped biological products also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics the ipr process with the uspto is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation 

in the event the company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges or upon the “atrisk” launch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product the company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time current legal proceedings involving the company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in note 19 “legal proceedings—intellectual property” under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

risks related to product development regulatory approval and commercialization 

significant challenges or delays in the company’s innovation and development of new products technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the company’s longterm success 

the company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients providers and consumers development of successful 



products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity new products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25 of 2021 sales the company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire companies products and technologies whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval and if approved whether the products will be commercially successful 

the company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties in all of these contexts developing new products particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices requires significant investment of resources over many years only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products the process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and healthcare providers’ future needs develop promising new compounds strategies and technologies achieve successful clinical trial results secure effective intellectual property protection obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis and if and when they reach the market successfully differentiate the company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment new products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement even following initial regulatory approval the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger realworld patient populations as well as market entry of competitive products 

risks related to financial and economic market conditions 

the company faces a variety of financial economic legal social and political risks associated with conducting business internationally  

the company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial economic legal social and political risks including those listed below 

foreign currency exchange  in fiscal 2021 approximately 50 of the company’s sales occurred outside of the us with approximately 25 in europe 6 in the western hemisphere excluding the us and 19 in the asiapacific and africa region changes in nonus currencies relative to the us dollar impact the company’s revenues and expenses while the company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations in addition the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the company’s nonus business activity are translated into us dollars 

inflation and currency devaluation risks  the company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates the company has accounted for operations in argentina and venezuela as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100 while the company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs productivity improvements and periodic price increases it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation in addition the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the company’s operating results 

illegal importation of pharmaceutical products  the illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the company’s sales and profitability in the us and other countries in which the company operates with the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current us law however the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lowerpriced imports has grown significantly 

antibribery and other regulations the company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials those laws include the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which prohibits us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials also in many countries outside the us the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities 



therefore the company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa various jurisdictions in which the company operates have laws and regulations including the uk bribery act 2010 aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior enforcement activities under these laws could subject the company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from healthcare programs 

other financial economic legal social and political risks  other risks inherent in conducting business globally include 

• local and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve including interest rates monetary policy inflation economic growth recession commodity prices and currency controls or other limitations on the ability to expatriate cash 

• protective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and importexport licensing requirements 

• compliance with local regulations and laws including in some countries regulatory requirements restricting the company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market 

• diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions 

• potential nationalization or expropriation of the company’s foreign assets 

• political or social upheavals economic instability repression or human rights issues and 

• geopolitical events including natural disasters disruptions to markets due to war armed conflict terrorism epidemics or pandemics 

failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moody’s investors service and standard  poor’s ratings services rating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings of our longterm and shortterm debt are based on a number of factors any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

risks related to the planned separation of our consumer health business 

the planned separation of the company’s consumer health business may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated if at all and may not achieve the expected results 

in november 2021 the company announced its intention to separate the company’s consumer health business with the intention to create a new publicly traded company the planned separation is intended to qualify as a taxfree transaction for us federal income tax purposes the company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement completion of the planned separation will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including among others consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies as required final approval of the company’s board of directors receipt of a favorable opinion and internal revenue service “irs” ruling with respect to the taxfree nature of the transaction and the receipt of other regulatory approvals there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the planned separation or that such separation will be completed unanticipated developments could delay prevent or otherwise adversely affect the planned separation including but not limited to disruptions in general or financial market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or clearances 

the costs to complete the planned separation will be significant in addition the company may be unable to achieve some or all of the strategic and financial benefits that it expects to achieve from the planned separation of the company’s consumer health business 

the company will incur significant expenses in connection with the planned separation in addition the company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the planned separation the anticipated benefits of the planned separation are based on a number of assumptions some of which may prove incorrect 



following the planned separation the price of shares of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly 

the company cannot predict the effect of the planned separation on the trading price of shares of its common stock and the market value of shares of its common stock may be less than equal to or greater than the market value of shares of its common stock prior to the planned separation in addition the price of the company’s common stock may be more volatile around the time of the planned separation 

the planned separation could result in substantial tax liability 

the company intends to obtain an opinion from its us tax advisors and a ruling from the irs as to the taxfree nature of the planned separation under the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the opinion and ruling will be based on among other things various factual assumptions and representations that the company and the new consumer health company will make regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete reliance on the opinion and ruling may be jeopardized if subsequent to the planned separation it is determined that the transaction does not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes the resulting tax liability to the company and its shareholders could be substantial the planned separation may also not qualify for taxfree treatment in other countries around the world and as a result may trigger substantial tax liability to the company 

other risks 

our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented highly skilled employees and a diverse workforce 

our continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds experiences and skill sets the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire develop and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization maintaining our brand and reputation as well as a diverse equitable and inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected in addition effective succession planning is important to our longterm success any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and results of operations 

climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations including an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters natural disasters and extreme weather conditions such as a hurricane tornado earthquake wildfire or flooding may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain the impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water scarcity limiting our ability to access sufficient highquality water in certain locations which may increase operational costs 

concern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions andor mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment if such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations we may experience disruption in or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing manufacturing and distribution of our products which may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition further the impacts of climate change have an influence on customer preferences and failure to provide climatefriendly products could potentially result in loss of market share 

an information security incident including a cybersecurity breach could have a negative impact to the company’s business or reputation 

to meet business objectives the company relies on both internal information technology it systems and networks and those of third parties and their vendors to process and store sensitive data including confidential research business plans financial information intellectual property and personal data that may be subject to legal protection and ensure the continuity of the company’s supply chain the extensive information security and cybersecurity threats which affect companies globally pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks and the confidentiality integrity and availability of the company’s sensitive data the company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection detection and response capabilities as well as ensure the company’s thirdparty providers have required capabilities and controls to address this risk  to date the company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks however because of the frequently changing attack techniques along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks there is the potential for the company to be adversely 



impacted this impact could result in reputational competitive operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action the company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident however the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial legal business or reputational losses 

a breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact to the company’s business or reputation 

the company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance obligations on the collection use storage access transfer and protection of personal data breach of such requirements could result in substantial fines penalties private right of actions claims and damage to our reputation and business new privacy laws are expected in other territories together with greater privacy enforcement by governmental authorities globally particularly on data localization requirements and international data flows the company has established privacy compliance programs and controls that our businesses worldwide are required to comply with but with many technology and datadriven initiatives being prioritized across the company and involving multiple vendors and third parties there are potential risks of controls imposed on cross border data flows unauthorized access and loss of personal data through internal and external threats that could impact our business operations and research activities

the company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency by entering into currency swap contracts a 1 change in the spread between us and foreign interest rates on the company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the company’s swap contracts by approximately 22 billion in either scenario at maturity the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows

economic and market factors 

covid19 considerations and business continuity 

the company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of covid19 on its business and financial results based upon information available at this time as follows 

• operating model the company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility designed into its manufacturing research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities 

• supply chain the company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dualsource capabilities while closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from highrisk areas to help ensure adequate and effective distribution 

• business continuity the robust active business continuity plans across the companys network have been instrumental in preparing the company for events like covid19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and consumer needs remains uninterrupted 

• workforce the company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing distribution commercial and research operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been established for other employees 

• liquidity the companys highquality credit rating allows the company superior access to the financial capital markets for the foreseeable future 

• domestic and foreign legislation the company will continue to assess and evaluate the ongoing global legislative efforts to combat the covid19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates currently the recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s operations 

in fiscal 2020 and 2021 the company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production with third party contract manufacturing organizations these arrangements provide the company with future supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if capacity is not required amounts paid for services to be delivered and contractually obligated to be paid to these contract manufacturing organizations of approximately 11 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other other assets accrued liabilities and other liabilities accounts in the companys consolidated balance sheet upon execution of each agreement additionally the company has entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing arrangements with government related organizations 

the company continues to evaluate and monitor both its internal and external supply arrangements including its contract with emergent biosolutions and related production activities at its bayview maryland facility the company has established a global vaccine supply network where in addition to its internal manufacturing site in leiden the netherlands ten other manufacturing sites will be involved in the production of vaccine across different countries and continents the company does not believe that a disruption at a vaccine manufacturing site or the resulting delay would have a material financial impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements or results 

the company is aware that its products are used in an environment where for more than a decade policymakers consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare in response to these concerns the company has a longstanding policy of pricing products responsibly for the period 2011  2021 in the us the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the company’s net price increases for healthcare products prescription and overthecounter drugs hospital and professional products was below the us consumer price index cpi 

the company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges the company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and consequently on the way companies operate the company has accounted for operations in argentina and venezuela as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100 this did not have a material impact to the companys results in the period in the face of increasing costs the company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs productivity improvements and periodic price increases 

the company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates a 1 change in the value of the us dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the company had sales income or expense in 2021 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately 05 billion and net income by approximately 02 billion 

governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates in connection with various government initiatives companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries a change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted this change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted 

the company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales promotions and reimbursement of healthcare products 



changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services including delaying medical procedures rationing prescription medications reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage as a result of the current global economic downturn may continue to impact the company’s businesses 

the company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights firms have filed abbreviated new drug applications or biosimilar biological product applications with the us fda or otherwise challenged the coverage andor validity of the companys patents seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products in the event the company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products and which may result in a noncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset there is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place 

legal proceedings 

johnson  johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability intellectual property commercial employment indemnification and other matters governmental investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business 

the company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated as of january 2 2022 the company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated the company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with asc 4502025 for these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments the ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including among other things whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete proceedings are in early stages matters present legal uncertainties there are significant facts in dispute procedural or jurisdictional issues the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims ability to achieve comprehensive multiparty settlements complexity of related crossclaims and counterclaims andor there are numerous parties involved to the extent adverse awards judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the company the company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated 

in the companys opinion based on its examination of these matters its experience to date and discussions with counsel the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings net of liabilities accrued in the companys balance sheet is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position however the resolution of or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period

investments and activities in some countries outside the us are subject to higher risks than comparable us activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to the companys business are generally readily available from multiple sources where there are exceptions the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company 

patents 

the companys subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible they own or are licensed under a significant number of patents in the us and other countries relating to their products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the company in the operation of its businesses the company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products significant legal proceedings and claims involving the companys patent and other intellectual property are described in note 19 “legal proceedings— intellectual property” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report

trademarks 

the company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means these trademarks are protected by registration in the us and other countries where such products are marketed the company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses 

seasonality 

worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for advertising and research and development activity 

competition 

in all of their product lines the companys subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved competition in research both internally and externally sourced involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the development of new and innovative products as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the company’s product portfolio is important to the companys success in all areas of its business the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research in addition the development and maintenance of customer demand for the company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion 

environment 

the company is subject to a variety of us and international environmental protection measures the company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations the company’s compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures cash flows earnings or competitive position 

regulation 

the company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement the company is subject to costly and complex us and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and business operations in the us the drug device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies primarily as to product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the us food and drug administration the us fda continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for us fda approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the us the new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation 



the regulatory agencies under whose purview the company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases the company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 

the us fda and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities if the us fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our drugs or medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the us fda could ban such products detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products order a recall repair replacement or refund of such products refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports andor require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the us fda may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis or enjoin andor restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law the us fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business 

  

the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world in the us attention has been focused by states regulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or to recommend use or purchase particular medical devices laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry there is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and health care providers various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and beginning with disclosures in 2022 to certain nonphysician practitioners federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require strict compliance with antibribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally 

  

us government agencies continue efforts to repeal modify or invalidate provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act the aca which passed in 2010 for example federal legislation repealed the aca’s individual mandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employersponsored healthcare plans the center for medicare  medicaid services cms began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered by medicaid expansion plans certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended and certain shortterm insurance plans not offering the full array of aca benefits have been allowed to extend in duration some of these changes are being challenged in us courts and so their longterm impact remains uncertain the aca has also been subject to judicial challenge in november 2020 the us supreme court heard argument in texas v azar  which challenges the constitutionality of the aca pending resolution of the litigation all of the aca but the individual mandate to buy health insurance remains in effect the us government also continues to propose and implement changes to the medicare part d benefit including the size of manufacturer discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of the benefit there are a number of additional bills pending in congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would affect drug pricing in the medicare and medicaid programs this changing federal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the us healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal law and potential modification or repeal of these laws will ultimately affect the industry 

in addition business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the us by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

further the company relies on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from the covid19 pandemic and brexit that may affect sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in the companys products these processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals 

the global regulatory landscape is also subject to change as the covid19 pandemic continues to affect the us and global economies the us fda and other health authorities have shifted resources and priorities to meet the many challenges presented by the pandemic pandemicrelated disruptions could negatively impact the processing of regulatory submissions and slow agency review times necessary for the approval or clearance of new drugs and devices the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in the company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties the company seeks to identify manage and mitigate risks to our business but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and many are outside of the companys control and cannot therefore be eliminated in addition to the other information in this report and the company’s other filings with the sec investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties if known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize the company’s business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected potentially in a material way 

risks related to our business industry and operations 

the company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the company’s earnings 

the company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets the company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of costeffectiveness technological innovations intellectual property rights product performance real or perceived product advantages pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement the company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the company competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products andor their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the company could negatively impact sales of the company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development 

for the company’s pharmaceutical businesses loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product for the company’s medical device businesses technological innovation product quality reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness development by other companies of new or improved products processes and technologies could threaten to make the company’s products or technologies less desirable less economical or obsolete the company’s consumer health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers’ privatelabel brands if the company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products 

interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the company’s business sales and reputation 

the company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex highquality components and materials the companys subsidiaries operate 90 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world the company has in the past and may in the future face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action production quality deviations or safety issues labor disputes sitespecific incidents such as fires natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events raw material shortages political unrest terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage 

the company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products any failure by or loss of a thirdparty manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs which may adversely affect our business 

the company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products we depend on these third party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices however we cannot guarantee that these thirdparty manufacturers will be able to meet our nearterm or longterm manufacturing requirements which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business 

other risks associated with our reliance on third parties including the company’s strategic partnership with jabil in the medical devices segment to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance misappropriation of the company’s intellectual property limited ability to manage our inventory possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us moreover if any of our third party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities lose benefits under material agreements experience power outages encounter financial difficulties are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency the company may 



experience significant business disruption in the event of any such disruption the company would need to seek and source other qualified thirdparty manufacturers likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely 

counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues earnings reputation and business 

our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the internet third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards to distributors and patients counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured – often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as the lack of regulation of their contents 

the industrys failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products potentially resulting in lost sales product recalls and an increased threat of litigation in addition diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the company’s business and could cause disruptions or future impact to the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to risks associated with global health crises and pandemics including the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and its mutations covid19 the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is expected to continue to adversely impact certain aspects of the company’s business results of operations and financial condition including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products the spread of covid19 has caused the company to modify its business practices including instituting remote work for many of the companys employees and the company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the company determines are in the best interests of our patients customers employees and business partners the company continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of covid19 these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain 

while the us and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies the extent to which covid19 will impact the companys future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence including the duration of the outbreak  any resurgence in covid19 infections could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease the continued global spread of covid19 could adversely impact the companys operations including among other things our manufacturing operations supply chain including thirdparty suppliers sales and marketing and clinical trial operations any of these factors could adversely affect the companys business financial results and global economic conditions generally 

we also face uncertainties related to our efforts to develop a covid19 vaccine candidate including uncertainties related to the risk that our development programs may not be successful commercially viable or receive approval or emergency use authorization from regulatory authorities risks associated with clinical trial data including further analyses of existing preclinical or clinical trial data that may be inconsistent with the data used for selection of the jnj78436735 vaccine candidate and dose level for the phase 3 ensemble trial the risk that clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments including during the peer reviewpublication process in the scientific community generally and by regulatory authorities disruptions in the relationships between us our thirdparty suppliers and external manufacturers the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any such products the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our rd and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide additional research funding for potential drug development related to covid19 the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis that we may experience manufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine candidate within the projected time periods indicated and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program and pricing and access challenges for such products including in the us 

in addition to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this risk factors section and those incorporated by reference herein i ncluding risks relating to the company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in consumption as well as changes in 



laws relating to supply of the company’s products  given that developments concerning the covid19 pandemic have been constantly evolving additional impacts and risks may arise including litigation that are not presently known to the company 

risk related to the government regulation and legal proceedings 

global sales in the company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures 

sales of the company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by thirdparty payers such as government healthcare programs private insurance plans and managed care organizations as part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed in the us increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers could result in further pricing pressures in addition increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures outside the us numerous major markets including the eu united kingdom and japan have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and in that regard directly or indirectly impose price controls limit access to or reimbursement for the company’s products or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection 

the company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses fines and reputational damage 

in the ordinary course of business johnson  johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes product liability and claims that their product sales marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust unfair trade practices andor consumer protection laws the companys more significant legal proceedings are described in note 19 “legal proceedings” under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report litigation in general and securities derivative action class action and multidistrict litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs may involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several years for example the company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc primarily johnsons ® baby powder and the company’s sale manufacturing and marketing of opioids while the company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation the company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters potentially in excess of accruals including matters where the company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants the resolution of or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period the company does not purchase thirdparty product liability insurance however the company utilizes a whollyowned captive insurance company subject to certain limits 

product reliability safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations lead to litigation and cause reputational damage 

concerns about product safety whether raised internally or by litigants regulators or consumer advocates and whether or not based on scientific evidence can result in safety alerts product recalls governmental investigations regulatory action on the part of the us food and drug administration or its counterpart in other countries private claims and lawsuits payment of fines and settlements declining sales and reputational damage these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image brand equity and consumer trust in the company’s products product recalls have in the past and could in the future prompt government investigations and inspections the shutdown of manufacturing facilities continued product shortages and related sales declines significant remediation costs reputational damage possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution 

the company faces significant regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the company to government investigations legal actions and penalties 

like other companies in the healthcare industry the company is subject to extensive regulation investigations and legal action by national state and local government agencies in the us and other countries in which they operate regulatory issues regarding compliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries by manufacturers of drugs devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties product recalls product shortages interruptions in production delays in new product approvals and litigation in addition the marketing pricing and sale of the company’s products are subject to regulation investigations and legal actions including under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the medicaid rebate program federal and state false claims acts state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws scrutiny of health care industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the us and any resulting investigations and prosecutions carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including but not limited to debarment from participation in government healthcare programs any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations the most significant current investigations and 



litigation brought by government agencies are described in note 19 “legal proceedingsgovernment proceedings” under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the company’s operating results 

changes in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the company’s effective tax rate and results of operations a change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted this change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted 

see note 8 on income taxes for additional information 

the company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities in connection with the 2015 organization for economic cooperation and development base erosion and profit shifting beps project companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves however any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the company’s expectations which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves 

risks related to our intellectual property 

the company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the company’s businesses 

the company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products and manufacturing processes these rights are essential to the company’s businesses and materially important to the company’s results of operations public policy both within and outside the us has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights the company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the united states and other important markets or that such protections once granted will last as long as originally anticipated 

competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation interferences oppositions and other proceedings such as inter partes review ipr proceedings before the united states patent  trademark office uspto these proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable in addition challenges that the company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question 

the company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products in the us manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity or claim noninfringement of innovator products through the abbreviated new drug application or anda process with the fda and related anda litigation the biologics price competition and innovation act bpcia enacted in 2010 which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the fda of biosimilar alternatives to innovatordeveloped biological products also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics the ipr process with the uspto is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation 

in the event the company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product the company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time current legal proceedings involving the company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in note 19 “legal proceedings—intellectual property” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

risks related to product development regulatory approval and commercialization 

significant challenges or delays in the company’s innovation and development of new products technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the company’s longterm success 



the company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients providers and consumers development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity new products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25 of 2020 sales the company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire companies products and technologies whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval and if approved whether the products will be commercially successful 

the company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties in all of these contexts developing new products particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices requires significant investment of resources over many years only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products the process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and health care providers’ future needs develop promising new compounds strategies and technologies achieve successful clinical trial results secure effective intellectual property protection obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis and if and when they reach the market successfully differentiate the company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment new products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement even following initial regulatory approval the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger realworld patient populations as well as market entry of competitive products 

risk related to financial and economic market conditions 

the company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally  

the company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the us are accompanied by certain financial economic and political risks including those listed below 

foreign currency exchange  in fiscal 2020 approximately 48 of the company’s sales occurred outside of the us with approximately 23 in europe 7 in the western hemisphere excluding the us and 18 in the asiapacific and africa region changes in nonus currencies relative to the us dollar impact the company’s revenues and expenses while the company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations in addition the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the company’s nonus business activity are translated into us dollars 

inflation and currency devaluation risks  the company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates the company has accounted for operations in argentina beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018 and venezuela as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100 while the company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs productivity improvements and periodic price increases it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation in addition the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the company’s operating results 

illegal importation of pharmaceutical products  the illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the company’s sales and profitability in the us and other countries in which the company operates with the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current us law however the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lowerpriced imports has grown significantly 

antibribery and other regulations the company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials those laws include the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which prohibits us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials also in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities 



therefore the company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa various jurisdictions in which the company operates have laws and regulations including the uk bribery act 2010 aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior enforcement activities under these laws could subject the company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from health care programs 

other legal social and political risks  other risks inherent in conducting business globally include 

• protective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and importexport licensing requirements 

• compliance with local regulations and laws including in some countries regulatory requirements restricting the company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market 

• diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions 

• potential nationalization or expropriation of the company’s foreign assets 

• political or social upheavals economic instability repression or human rights issues and 

• geopolitical events including natural disasters disruptions to markets due to war armed conflict terrorism epidemics or pandemics 

failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

we currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with moodys investors service and standard  poors ratings services rating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings of our longterm and shortterm debt are based on a number of factors any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets 

other risks 

our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented highly skilled employees and a diverse workforce 

our continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds experiences and skill sets the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire develop and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization maintaining our brand and reputation as well as a diverse equitable and inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected in addition effective succession planning is important to our longterm success any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

an information security incident including a cybersecurity breach could have a negative impact to the company’s business or reputation 

to meet business objectives the company relies on both internal technology it systems and networks and those of third parties and their vendors to process and store sensitive data including confidential research business plans financial information intellectual property and personal data that may be subject to legal protection and ensure the continuity of the company’s supply chain the extensive information security and cybersecurity threats which affect companies globally pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks and the confidentiality integrity and availability of the company’s sensitive data the company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection detection and response capabilities as well as ensure the company’s thirdparty providers have required capabilities and controls to address this risk  to date the company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks however because of the frequently changing attack techniques along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks there is the potential for the company to be adversely impacted this impact could result in reputational competitive operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and 



regulatory action the company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident however the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial legal business or reputational losses 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and results of operations 

climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations including an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters natural disasters and extreme weather conditions such as a hurricane tornado earthquake wildfire or flooding may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain the impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water scarcity limiting our ability to access sufficient highquality water in certain locations which may increase operational costs 

concern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions andor mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment if such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations we may experience disruption in or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing manufacturing and distribution of our products which may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition

the company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows accordingly the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions a 10 appreciation of the us dollar from the january 3 2021 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the company’s forward contracts by 121 million conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar from the january 3 2021 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the company’s forward contracts by 148 million in either scenario the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows 

the company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency by entering into currency swap contracts a 1 change in the spread between us and foreign interest rates on the company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the company’s swap contracts by approximately 1667 million in either scenario at maturity the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows

• domestic and foreign legislation the company will continue to assess and evaluate the ongoing global legislative efforts to combat the covid19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates currently the recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s operations 

in fiscal 2020 the company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production with third party contract manufacturing organizations these arrangements provide the company with future supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if capacity is not required amounts paid and contractually obligated to be paid to these contract manufacturing organizations of approximately 09 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other other assets accrued liabilities and other liabilities accounts in the companys consolidated balance sheet upon execution of each agreement additionally the company has entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing arrangements with government related organizations

the company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges the company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and consequently on the way companies operate the company has accounted for operations in argentina beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018 and venezuela as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100 this did not have a material impact to the companys results in the period in the face of increasing costs the company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs productivity improvements and periodic price increases

the company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates a 1 change in the value of the us dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the company had sales income or expense in 2020 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately 384 million and net income by approximately 115 million 



governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates a change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted this change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted 

the company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales promotions and reimbursement of health care products 

changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services including delaying medical procedures rationing prescription medications reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage as a result of the current global economic downturn may continue to impact the company’s businesses 

the company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights firms have filed abbreviated new drug applications or biosimilar biological product applications with the fda or otherwise challenged the coverage andor validity of the companys patents seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products in the event the company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products and which may result in a noncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset there is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place 

legal proceedings 

johnson  johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability intellectual property commercial and other matters governmental investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business 

the company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated as of january 3 2021 the company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated the company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with asc 4502025 for these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments the ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including among other things whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete proceedings are in early stages matters present legal uncertainties there are significant facts in dispute procedural or jurisdictional issues the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims ability to achieve comprehensive multiparty settlements complexity of related crossclaims and counterclaims andor there are numerous parties involved to the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the company the company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated 

in the companys opinion based on its examination of these matters its experience to date and discussions with counsel the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings net of liabilities accrued in the companys balance sheet is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position however the resolution of or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period

johnson  johnson and its subsidiaries the company have approximately 132200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field the company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and wellbeing 

the products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– segments of business – consumer” “– pharmaceutical” and “– medical devices” however the principal markets products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture the products sold in international business include those developed in the us and by subsidiaries abroad 

investments and activities in some countries outside the us are subject to higher risks than comparable us activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to the companys business are generally readily available from multiple sources where there are exceptions the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company 

patents 

the companys subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible they own or are licensed under a significant number of patents in the us and other countries relating to their products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the company in the operation of its businesses the company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products significant legal proceedings and claims involving the companys patent and other intellectual property are described in note 21 “legal proceedings— intellectual property” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

sales of the company’s largest product stelara ® ustekinumab accounted for approximately 78 of the companys total revenues for fiscal 2019 accordingly the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the company 



  

there is one set of granted patents related specifically to stelara ®  this set of patents is owned by janssen biotech inc a whollyowned subsidiary of johnson  johnson these patents are in force in the us and many countries outside the us in the us the latest projected expiration date for patents in this set is 2023 due to patent term extension and adjustment in most of europe the latest projected expiration date for patents in this set is 2024 due to a supplementary protection certificate patent term extension in most other countries the latest projected expiration date is 2021 

in addition to competing in the immunology market with stelara ®  the company is currently marketing simponi ® golimumab and simponi aria ® golimumab next generation immunology products patents related to these products are in force and the latest projected us expiration date is 2024 due to patent term extension and adjustment the company also markets remicade ® infliximab in the immunology market which is the company’s 2nd largest product patents on this product have expired and the food and drug administration approved the first infliximab biosimilar for sale in the us in 2016 and a number of such products have been launched since then for a more extensive description of legal matters regarding the patents related to remicade ®  see note 21 “legal proceedings  intellectual property  pharmaceutical  remicade ® related cases” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

trademarks 

the company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means these trademarks are protected by registration in the us and other countries where such products are marketed the company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses 

seasonality 

worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for advertising and research and development activity 

competition 

in all of their product lines the companys subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved competition in research both internally and externally sourced involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the development of new and innovative products as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the company’s product portfolio is important to the companys success in all areas of its business the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research in addition the development and maintenance of customer demand for the company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion 

environment 

the company is subject to a variety of us and international environmental protection measures the company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations the company’s compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures cash flows earnings or competitive position 

regulation 

the company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement we are subject to costly and complex us and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations in the us the drug device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies primarily as to product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the us food and drug administration the fda continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for fda approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the us the new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation 

the regulatory agencies under whose purview the company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases the company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 



  

the fda and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities if the us fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our drugs or medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the us fda could ban such products detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products order a recall repair replacement or refund of such products refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports andor require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the us fda may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis or enjoin andor restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law the us fda may also recommend prosecution to the us department of justice any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business 

the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world in the us attention has been focused by states regulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or to recommend use or purchase particular medical devices there is increased focus on interactions between healthcare companies and health care providers and various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of financial relationships between companies and health care providers payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally 

us government agencies continue efforts to repeal and modify provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act the aca which passed in 2010 for example federal legislation repealed the aca’s individual mandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employersponsored healthcare plans cms began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered by medicaid expansion plans certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended and certain shortterm insurance plans not offering the full array of aca benefits have been allowed to extend in duration some of these changes are being challenged in us courts and so their longterm impact remains uncertain the us government also continues to propose and implement changes to the medicare part d benefit including the size of manufacturer discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of the benefit this changing federal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the us healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal law and potential modification or repeal of these laws will ultimately affect the industry 

in addition business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the us by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

further the company relies on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from brexit that may affect sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in the companys products these processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals

risk factors 

tableend the company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the companys control in addition to the other information in this report and the company’s other filings with the sec investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties if known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize the company’s business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected potentially in a material way 

global sales in the company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures 

sales of the company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by thirdparty payers such as government healthcare programs private insurance plans and managed care organizations as part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed in the us increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers could result in further pricing pressures in addition increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures outside the us numerous major markets including the eu and japan have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and in that regard directly or indirectly impose price controls limit access to or reimbursement for the company’s products or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection 

the company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses fines and reputational damage 

in the ordinary course of business johnson  johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes product liability and claims that their product sales marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust unfair trade practices andor consumer protection laws the most significant of these proceedings are described in note 21 “legal proceedings” under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report litigation in general and securities derivative action class action and multidistrict litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs or may be determined to be class actions and may involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several years for example the company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc primarily johnsons ® baby powder and the company’s sale manufacturing and marketing of opioids while the company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation the company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters potentially in excess of accruals including matters where the company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants the resolution of or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period furthermore as a result of cost and availability factors effective november 1 2005 the company ceased purchasing thirdparty product liability insurance 

product reliability safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations lead to litigation and cause reputational damage 

concerns about product safety whether raised internally or by litigants regulators or consumer advocates and whether or not based on scientific evidence can result in safety alerts product recalls governmental investigations regulatory action on the part of the fda or its counterpart in other countries private claims and lawsuits payment of fines and settlements declining sales and reputational damage these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image brand equity and consumer trust in the company’s products product recalls have in the past and could in the future prompt government investigations and inspections the shutdown of manufacturing facilities continued product shortages and related sales declines significant remediation costs reputational damage possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution 

changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the company’s operating results 

changes in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the company’s effective tax rate and results of operations a change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted this change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted 



  

in fiscal year 2019 switzerland enacted the federal act on tax reform and ahv financing traf which became effective on january 1 2020 as of december 29 2019 certain cantons where the company operates have not yet enacted portions of the tax reform as stipulated in the swiss federal law these enactments and future possible guidance from the applicable taxing authorities may have a material impact on the company’s operating results 

see note 8 on income taxes for additional information 

the company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities in connection with the organization for economic cooperation and development base erosion and profit shifting beps project companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves however any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the company’s expectations which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves 

the company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the company’s businesses 

the company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights determined by patent offices courts and lawmakers in various countries relating to its products and manufacturing processes these rights are essential to the company’s businesses and materially important to the company’s results of operations public policy both within and outside the us has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights the company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the us and other important markets or that such protections once granted will last as long as originally anticipated 

competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation interferences oppositions and other proceedings these proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable in addition challenges that the company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question 

the company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products in the us manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity or claim noninfringement of innovator products through the abbreviated new drug application or anda process with the fda the biologics price competition and innovation act bpcia enacted in 2010 which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the fda of biosimilar alternatives to innovatordeveloped biological products also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics the inter partes review ipr process with the uspto created under the 2011 america invents act is also being used by competitors to challenge patents held by the company’s subsidiaries 

in the event the company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product the company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time current legal proceedings involving the company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in note 21 “legal proceedings—intellectual property” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

the company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the company’s earnings 

the company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets the company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of costeffectiveness technological innovations intellectual property rights product performance real or perceived product advantages pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement the company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the company competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products andor their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the company could negatively impact sales of the company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development 



  

for the company’s pharmaceutical businesses loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product for the company’s medical device businesses technological innovation product quality reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness development by other companies of new or improved products processes and technologies could threaten to make the company’s products or technologies less desirable less economical or obsolete the company’s consumer businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers’ privatelabel brands if the company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products 

significant challenges or delays in the company’s innovation and development of new products technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the company’s longterm success 

the company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients providers and consumers development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity new products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25 of 2019 sales the company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire companies products and technologies whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval and if approved whether the products will be commercially successful 

the company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties in all of these contexts developing new products particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices requires significant investment of resources over many years only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products the process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and health care providers’ future needs develop promising new compounds strategies and technologies achieve successful clinical trial results secure effective intellectual property protection obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis and if and when they reach the market successfully differentiate the company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment new products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement even following initial regulatory approval the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real world patient populations as well as market entry of competitive products 

the company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the company to government investigations legal actions and penalties 

like other companies in the healthcare industry the company is subject to extensive regulation investigations and legal action by national state and local government agencies in the us and other countries in which they operate regulatory issues regarding compliance with good manufacturing practices cgmp and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries by manufacturers of drugs devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties product recalls product shortages interruptions in production delays in new product approvals and litigation in addition the marketing pricing and sale of the company’s products are subject to regulation investigations and legal actions including under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the medicaid rebate program federal and state false claims acts state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws increased scrutiny of health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the us and any resulting investigations and prosecutions carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including but not limited to debarment from participation in government healthcare programs any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations the most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in note 21 “legal proceedingsgovernment proceedings” under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

the company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally 

the company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the us are accompanied by certain financial economic and political risks including those listed below 

foreign currency exchange  in fiscal 2019 approximately 49 of the company’s sales occurred outside of the us with approximately 23 in europe 7 in the western hemisphere excluding the us and 19 in the asiapacific and africa region changes in nonus currencies relative to the us dollar impact the company’s revenues and expenses while the company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows 



  

unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations in addition the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the company’s nonus business activity are translated into us dollars 

inflation and currency devaluation risks  the company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates the company has accounted for operations in argentina beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018 and venezuela as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100 while the company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs productivity improvements and periodic price increases it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation in addition the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the company’s operating results 

illegal importation of pharmaceutical products  the illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the company’s sales and profitability in the us and other countries in which the company operates with the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current us law however the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lowerpriced imports has grown significantly 

antibribery and other regulations the company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials those laws include the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which prohibits us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials also in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore the company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa various jurisdictions in which the company operates have laws and regulations including the uk bribery act 2010 aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior enforcement activities under these laws could subject the company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from health care programs 

other legal social and political risks  other risks inherent in conducting business globally include 

 interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the company’s business sales and reputation 

the company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex highquality components and materials the companys subsidiaries operate 97 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world the company has in the past and may in the future face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action production quality deviations or safety issues labor disputes sitespecific incidents such as fires natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events raw material shortages political unrest and terrorist attacks such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage 

the company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products any failure by or loss of a third party manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs which may adversely affect our business 

the company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products we depend on these third party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality 



  

and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices however we cannot guarantee that these third party manufacturers will be able to meet our nearterm or longterm manufacturing requirements which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business 

other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance misappropriation of the company’s intellectual property limited ability to manage our inventory possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us moreover if any of our third party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities lose benefits under material agreements experience power outages encounter financial difficulties are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency the company may experience significant business disruption in the event of any such disruption the company would need to seek and source other qualified third party manufacturers likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely 

counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues earnings reputation and business 

our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the internet third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards to distributors and patients counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufacturedoften in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sitesas well as the lack of regulation of their contents 

the industrys failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products potentially resulting in lost sales product recalls and an increased threat of litigation in addition diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability 

an information security incident including a cybersecurity breach could have a negative impact to the company’s business or reputation 

to meet business objectives the company relies on both internal information technology it systems and networks and those of third parties and their vendors to process and store sensitive data including confidential research business plans financial information intellectual property and personal data that may be subject to legal protection the extensive information security and cybersecurity threats which affect companies globally pose a risk to the security and availability of these it systems and networks and the confidentiality integrity and availability of the company’s sensitive data the company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection detection and response capabilities as well as ensure the company’s third party providers have required capabilities and controls to address this risk  to date the company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks however because of the frequently changing attack techniques along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks there is the potential for the company to be adversely impacted this impact could result in reputational competitive operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action the company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident however the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial losses

10 depreciation of the us dollar from the december 29 2019 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the company’s forward contracts by 331 million in either scenario the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows 

the company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency by entering into currency swap contracts a 1 change in the spread between us and foreign interest rates on the company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the company’s swap contracts by approximately 1043 million in either scenario at maturity the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows

the company follows the provisions of us gaap when recording litigation related contingencies a liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated the best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued however if no estimate in the range is better than any other the minimum amount is accrued 



  

see notes 1 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings

economic and market factors 

the company is aware that its products are used in an environment where for more than a decade policymakers consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care in response to these concerns the company has a longstanding policy of pricing products responsibly for the period 2009  2019 in the us the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the company’s net price increases for health care products prescription and overthecounter drugs hospital and professional products was below the us consumer price index cpi 

the company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges the company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and consequently on the way companies operate the company has accounted for operations in argentina beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018 and venezuela as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100 this did not have a material impact to the companys results in the period in the face of increasing costs the company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs productivity improvements and periodic price increases 

in june 2016 the united kingdom uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union eu commonly referred to as “brexit” and on january 31 2020 the uk formally exited the eu given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what the ultimate financial trade regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the uk from the eu will have brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty which may cause among other consequences volatility in exchange rates and interest rates additional cost containment by thirdparty payors and changes in regulations however the company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or operating results as of december 29 2019 the business of the company’s uk subsidiaries represented less than 3 of both the company’s consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues respectively 

the company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates a 1 change in the value of the us dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the company had sales income or expense in 2019 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately 390 million and net income by approximately 120 million 

governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates a change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted this change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates changes to the statutory tax rate 



  

may occur at any time and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted for discussion on federal act on tax reform and ahv financing swiss tax reform see provision for taxes on income in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales promotions and reimbursement of health care products 

changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services including delaying medical procedures rationing prescription medications reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage as a result of the current global economic downturn may continue to impact the company’s businesses 

the company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights firms have filed abbreviated new drug applications or biosimilar biological product applications with the fda or otherwise challenged the coverage andor validity of the companys patents seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products in the event the company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products and which may result in a noncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset there is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place for further information see the discussion on “remicade ® related cases” and “litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications” in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

legal proceedings 

johnson  johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability intellectual property commercial and other matters governmental investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business 

the company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated as of december 29 2019  the company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated the company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with asc 4502025 for these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments the ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including among other things whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete proceedings are in early stages matters present legal uncertainties there are significant facts in dispute procedural or jurisdictional issues the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims or there are numerous parties involved to the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the company the company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated 

in the companys opinion based on its examination of these matters its experience to date and discussions with counsel the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings net of liabilities accrued in the companys balance sheet is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position however the resolution of or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period

investments and activities in some countries outside the us are subject to higher risks than comparable us activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to the companys business are generally readily available from multiple sources where there are exceptions the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company 

patents 

the companys subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible they own or are licensed under a significant number of patents in the us and other countries relating to their products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the company in the operation of its businesses the company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products significant legal proceedings and claims involving the companys patent and other intellectual property are described in note 21 “legal proceedings— intellectual property” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

sales of the company’s 2 nd  largest product stelara ®  ustekinumab accounted for approximately 63 of the companys total revenues for fiscal 2018 accordingly the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the company 

there is one set of granted patents related specifically to stelara ®  this set of patents is owned by janssen biotech inc a whollyowned subsidiary of johnson  johnson these patents are in force in the us and many countries outside the 

       

  

united states in the us the latest projected expiration date for patents in this set is 2023 due to a patent term extension in europe the latest projected expiration date for patents in this set is 2024 due to a supplemental patent certificate patent term extension in most other countries the latest projected expiration date is 2021 

in addition to competing in the immunology market with stelara ®  the company is currently marketing simponi ®  golimumab and simponi aria ®  golimumab next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to six years the company also markets remicade ®  infliximab in the immunology market which is the company’s largest product patents on this product have expired and the food and drug administration approved the first infliximab biosimilar for sale in the us in 2016 and a number of such products have been launched since then for a more extensive description of legal matters regarding the patents related to remicade ®  see note 21 “legal proceedings  intellectual property  pharmaceutical  remicade ®  related cases” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

trademarks 

the company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means these trademarks are protected by registration in the us and other countries where such products are marketed the company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses 

seasonality 

worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for advertising and research and development activity 

competition 

in all of their product lines the companys subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved competition in research both internally and externally sourced involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the development of new and innovative products as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the company’s product portfolio is important to the companys success in all areas of its business the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research in addition the development and maintenance of customer demand for the company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion 

environment 

the company is subject to a variety of us and international environmental protection measures the company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations the company’s compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures cash flows earnings or competitive position 

regulation 

the company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation in the us the drug device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies primarily as to product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the us food and drug administration the fda continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for fda approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the us the new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in europe are examples of such increased regulation 

the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world in the us attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or to recommend use or purchase particular medical devices payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally 

       

  

us government agencies continue to implement the extensive requirements of the patient protection and affordable care act the aca these have both positive and negative impacts on the us healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the aca and potential modification or repeal of aca provisions will ultimately affect the industry 

the regulatory agencies under whose purview the company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases the company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 

in addition business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the us by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

further the company relies on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from brexit that may affect sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in the companys products these processes also are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals

risk factors 

tableend the company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the companys control in addition to the other information in this report and the company’s other filings with the sec investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties if known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize the company’s business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected potentially in a material way 

global sales in the company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures 

sales of the company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by thirdparty payers such as government healthcare programs private insurance plans and managed care organizations as part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed in the us increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers could result in further pricing pressures in addition increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures outside the us numerous major markets including the eu and japan have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and in that regard directly or indirectly impose price controls limit access to or reimbursement for the company’s products or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection 

the company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses fines and reputational damage 

in the ordinary course of business johnson  johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes product liability and claims that their product sales marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust unfair trade practices andor consumer protection laws the most significant of these proceedings are described in note 21 “legal proceedings” under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report while the company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation the company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters potentially in excess of accruals including matters where the company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants the resolution of or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period furthermore as a result of cost and availability factors effective november 1 2005 the company ceased purchasing thirdparty product liability insurance 

product reliability safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations lead to litigation and cause reputational damage 

concerns about product safety whether raised internally or by litigants regulators or consumer advocates and whether or not based on scientific evidence can result in safety alerts product recalls governmental investigations regulatory action on the part of the fda or its counterpart in other countries private claims and lawsuits payment of fines and settlements declining sales and reputational damage these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image brand equity and consumer trust in the company’s products product recalls have in the past and could in the future prompt government investigations and inspections the shutdown of manufacturing facilities continued product shortages and related sales declines significant remediation costs reputational damage possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution 

changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the company’s operating results 

changes in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the company’s effective tax rate and results of operations a change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted this change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted   

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja which introduced significant changes to us corporate income tax law that will have a meaningful impact on the company’s provision for income taxes accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja requires significant judgments to be made in interpreting its provisions anticipated guidance from the us treasury about implementing the tcja which should be final by june 22 2019 18 months after enactment 

       

  

may result in adjustments that could materially affect the company’s financial position and results of operations as well as the effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made 

on september 28 2018 the swiss parliament approved the federal act on tax reform and ahv financing swiss tax reform however a referendum has been called and as a result a public vote on the swiss tax reform will take place on may 19th 2019 i f the swiss tax reform passes then the measures are expected to come into force in either january 2020 or january 2021 prior to approval in the referendum and its subsequent cantonal implementation the proposed swiss tax reform is not enacted and therefore the company has not reflected any of the potential impacts in its fiscal results the company is currently assessing the impact of the proposed swiss tax reform and when enacted the law may have a material impact on the company’s operating results 

the company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities in connection with the organization for economic cooperation and development base erosion and profit shifting beps project companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves however any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the company’s expectations which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves 

the company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the company’s businesses 

the company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights determined by patent offices courts and lawmakers in various countries relating to its products and manufacturing processes these rights are essential to the company’s businesses and materially important to the company’s results of operations public policy both within and outside the us has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights the company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the us and other important markets or that such protections once granted will last as long as originally anticipated 

competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation interferences oppositions and other proceedings these proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable in addition challenges that the company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question 

the company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products in the us manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity or claim noninfringement of innovator products through the abbreviated new drug application or anda process with the fda the biologics price competition and innovation act bpcia enacted in 2010 which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the fda of biosimilar alternatives to innovatordeveloped biological products also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics the inter partes review ipr process with the uspto created under the 2011 america invents act is also being used by competitors to challenge patents held by the company’s subsidiaries 

in the event the company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product the company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time current legal proceedings involving the company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in note 21 “legal proceedings—intellectual property” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

the company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the company’s earnings 

the company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets the company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of costeffectiveness technological innovations intellectual property rights product performance real or perceived product advantages pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement the company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the company competitors’ development of more effective or 

       

  

less costly products andor their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the company could negatively impact sales of the company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development 

for the company’s pharmaceutical businesses loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product for the company’s medical device businesses technological innovation product quality reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness development by other companies of new or improved products processes and technologies could threaten to make the company’s products or technologies less desirable less economical or obsolete the company’s consumer businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers’ privatelabel brands if the company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products 

significant challenges or delays in the company’s innovation and development of new products technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the company’s longterm success 

the company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients providers and consumers development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity new products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25 of 2018 sales the company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire companies products and technologies whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval and if approved whether the products will be commercially successful 

the company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties in all of these contexts developing new products particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices requires significant investment of resources over many years only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products the process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and health care providers’ future needs develop promising new compounds strategies and technologies achieve successful clinical trial results secure effective intellectual property protection obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis and if and when they reach the market successfully differentiate the company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment new products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement even following initial regulatory approval the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real world patient populations as well as market entry of competitive products 

the company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the company to government investigations legal actions and penalties 

like other companies in the healthcare industry the company is subject to extensive regulation investigations and legal action by national state and local government agencies in the us and other countries in which they operate regulatory issues regarding compliance with good manufacturing practices cgmp and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries by manufacturers of drugs devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties product recalls product shortages interruptions in production delays in new product approvals and litigation in addition the marketing pricing and sale of the company’s products are subject to regulation investigations and legal actions including under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the medicaid rebate program federal and state false claims acts state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws increased scrutiny of health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the us and any resulting investigations and prosecutions carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including but not limited to debarment from participation in government healthcare programs any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations the most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in note 21 “legal proceedingsgovernment proceedings” under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

the company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally 

the company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the us are accompanied by certain financial economic and political risks including those listed below 

       

  

foreign currency exchange  in fiscal 2018 approximately 49 of the company’s sales occurred outside of the us with approximately 23 in europe 8 in the western hemisphere excluding the us and 18 in the asiapacific and africa region changes in nonus currencies relative to the us dollar impact the company’s revenues and expenses while the company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations in addition the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the company’s nonus business activity are translated into us dollars 

inflation and currency devaluation risks  the company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates the company has accounted for operations in argentina beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018 and venezuela as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100 while the company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs productivity improvements and periodic price increases it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation in addition the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the company’s operating results 

illegal importation of pharmaceutical products  the illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the company’s sales and profitability in the us and other countries in which the company operates with the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current us law however the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lowerpriced imports has grown significantly 

antibribery and other regulations the company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials those laws include the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which prohibits us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials also in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore the company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa various jurisdictions in which the company operates have laws and regulations including the uk bribery act 2010 aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior enforcement activities under these laws could subject the company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from health care programs 

other legal social and political risks  other risks inherent in conducting business globally include 

 interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the company’s business sales and reputation 

the company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex highquality components and materials the companys subsidiaries operate 111 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world the company has in the past and may in the future face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action production quality deviations or safety issues labor disputes sitespecific incidents such as fires natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events raw material shortages political unrest and terrorist attacks such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage 

       

  

the company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products any failure by or loss of a third party manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs which may adversely affect our business 

the company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products we depend on these third party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices however we cannot guarantee that these third party manufacturers will be able to meet our nearterm or longterm manufacturing requirements which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business 

other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance misappropriation of the company’s intellectual property limited ability to manage our inventory possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us moreover if any of our third party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities lose benefits under material agreements experience power outages encounter financial difficulties are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency the company may experience significant business disruption in the event of any such disruption the company would need to seek and source other qualified third party manufacturers likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely 

an information security incident including a cybersecurity breach could have a negative impact to the company’s business or reputation 

to meet business objectives the company relies on both internal information technology it systems and networks and those of third parties and their vendors to process and store sensitive data including confidential research business plans financial information intellectual property and personal data that may be subject to legal protection the extensive information security and cybersecurity threats which affect companies globally pose a risk to the security and availability of these it systems and networks and the confidentiality integrity and availability of the company’s sensitive data the company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection detection and response capabilities as well as ensure the company’s third party providers have required capabilities and controls to address this risk  to date the company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks however because of the frequently changing attack techniques along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks there is the potential for the company to be adversely impacted this impact could result in reputational competitive operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action the company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident however the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial losses

major consumer franchise sales 

  

 the beauty franchise sales of 44 billion increased 43 as compared to the prior year growth was primarily driven by neutrogena ®  ogx ®  and aveeno ®  products as well as strength of dr ci labo and dabao ®  products outside the us growth was partially offset by the divestiture of nizoral ®

the patents for remicade ® infliximab in certain countries in europe expired in february 2015 biosimilar versions of remicade ®  have been introduced in certain markets outside the us resulting in a reduction in sales of remicade ®  in those markets additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in remicade ®  sales in markets outside the united states in the us a biosimilar version of remicade ®  was introduced in 2016 and additional competitors continue to enter the market continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the us market will result in a further reduction in us sales of remicade ®  see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of legal matters regarding the remicade ® patents

the company follows the provisions of us gaap when recording litigation related contingencies a liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated the best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued however if no estimate in the range is better than any other the minimum amount is accrued 

see notes 1 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings

economic and market factors 

the company is aware that its products are used in an environment where for more than a decade policymakers consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care in response to these concerns the company has a longstanding policy of pricing products responsibly for the period 2008  2018 in the us the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the company’s net price increases for health care products prescription and overthecounter drugs hospital and professional products was below the us consumer price index cpi 

the company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges the company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and consequently on the way companies operate the company has accounted for operations in argentina beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018 and venezuela as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100 this did not have a material impact to the companys results in the period in the face of increasing costs the company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs productivity improvements and periodic price increases 

in june 2016 the united kingdom uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union eu commonly referred to as “brexit” and in march 2017 the uk formally started the process for the uk to leave the eu given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the uk from the eu will have brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty which may cause among other consequences volatility in exchange rates and interest rates additional cost containment by thirdparty payors and changes in regulations however the company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or operating results as of december 30 2018 the business of the company’s uk subsidiaries represented less than 3 of both the company’s consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues respectively 

the company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates a 1 change in the value of the us dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the company had sales income or expense in 2018 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately 390 million and net income by approximately 100 million 

governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates a change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted this change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted on september 28 2018 the swiss parliament approved the federal act on tax reform and ahv financing swiss tax reform however a referendum has been called and as a result a public vote on the swiss tax reform 

       

  

will take place on may 19th 2019 if the swiss tax reform passes then the measures are expected to come into force in either january 2020 or january 2021 prior to approval in the referendum and its subsequent cantonal implementation the proposed swiss tax reform is not enacted and therefore the company has not reflected any of the potential impacts in its fiscal results the company is currently assessing the impact of the proposed swiss tax reform and when enacted the law may have a material impact on the company’s operating results 

the company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales promotions and reimbursement of health care products 

changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services including delaying medical procedures rationing prescription medications reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage as a result of the current global economic downturn may continue to impact the company’s businesses 

the company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights firms have filed abbreviated new drug applications or biosimilar biological product applications with the fda or otherwise challenged the coverage andor validity of the companys patents seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products in the event the company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products and which may result in a noncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset there is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place for further information see the discussion on “remicade ®  related cases” and “litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications” in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

legal proceedings 

johnson  johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability intellectual property commercial and other matters governmental investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business 

the company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 4502025 for these and other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions the ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete proceedings are in early stages matters present legal uncertainties there are significant facts in dispute or there are numerous parties involved 

in the companys opinion based on its examination of these matters its experience to date and discussions with counsel the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings net of liabilities accrued in the companys balance sheet is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position however the resolution of or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period

investments and activities in some countries outside the us are subject to higher risks than comparable us activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to the companys business are generally readily available from multiple sources where there are exceptions the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company 

patents 

the companys subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible they own or are licensed under a significant number of patents in the us and other countries relating to their products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the company in the operation of its businesses the company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products significant legal proceedings and claims involving the companys patent and other intellectual property are described in note 21 “legal proceedings—intellectual property” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

sales of the company’s largest product remicade ®  infliximab accounted for approximately 83 of the companys total net trade sales for fiscal 2017 

there are two sets of patents related specifically to remicade ®  the first set of patents is coowned by janssen biotech inc a whollyowned subsidiary of johnson  johnson and nyu langone medical center nyu janssen biotech inc has an exclusive license to nyus interests in the patents these patents have expired in all countries outside the united states   in the united states the one remaining patent which expires in september 2018 stands rejected following 

       

  

reexamination proceedings instituted by a third party in the united states patent and trademark office uspto the patent has also been held invalid by the federal district court in the district of massachusetts in january 2018 the us court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the invalidity of the remaining patent 

the second set of patents specifically related to remicade ®  was granted to the kennedy institute of rheumatology in europe canada australia and the united states janssen biotech inc has licenses exclusive for human antitnf antibodies and semiexclusive for nonhuman antitnf antibodies to these patents which expired in 2017 outside of the united states and will expire in august 2018 in the united states certain of these patents have been successfully challenged and invalidated and others are under review in various patent offices around the world and are also subject to litigation in canada 

the company does not expect that any extensions will be available for the above described patents specifically related to remicade ®  in the united states a biosimilar version of remicade ® was introduced in 2016 and additional competitors continue to enter the market for a more extensive description of legal matters regarding the patents related to remicade ®  see note 21 “legal proceedings – intellectual property – pharmaceutical – remicade ®  related cases” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

in addition to competing in the immunology market with remicade ®  the company is currently marketing stelara ®  ustekinumab simponi ®  golimumab simponi aria ®  golimumab and tremfya ®  guselkumab next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to six years 

trademarks 

the company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means these trademarks are protected by registration in the us and other countries where such products are marketed the company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses 

seasonality 

worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for advertising and research and development activity 

competition 

in all of their product lines the companys subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved competition in research both internally and externally sourced involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the development of new and innovative products as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the company’s product portfolio is important to the companys success in all areas of its business the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research in addition the development and maintenance of customer demand for the company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion 

research and development 

research activities represent a significant part of the company’s businesses research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering testing and developing new products upfront payments and milestones improving existing products as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch the company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to 106 billion 91 billion and 90 billion for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively research facilities are located in the united states belgium brazil canada china france germany israel japan the netherlands switzerland and the united kingdom with additional rd support in over 30 other countries 

environment 

the company is subject to a variety of us and international environmental protection measures the company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations the company’s compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures cash flows earnings or competitive position 

       

  

regulation 

the company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation in the us the drug device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies primarily as to product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the us food and drug administration the fda continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for fda approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the us the new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in europe are examples of such increased regulation 

the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world in the us attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or to recommend use or purchase particular medical devices payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally 

us government agencies continue to implement the extensive requirements of the patient protection and affordable care act the aca these have both positive and negative impacts on the us healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the aca and potential modification or repeal of aca provisions will ultimately affect the industry 

the regulatory agencies under whose purview the company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases the company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 

in addition business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the united states by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

further the company relies on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from brexit that may affect sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in the companys products these processes also are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals

risk factors 

tableend the company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the companys control in addition to the other information in this report and the company’s other filings with the sec investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties if known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize the company’s business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected potentially in a material way 

the company’s largest product remicade ®  infliximab is experiencing biosimilar competition which will result in a reduction in us sales of remicade ®  

the company has experienced significant challenges to patents covering its largest product remicade ®  infliximab accounting for approximately 83 of the company’s total net trade sales for fiscal 2017 and continues to assert certain patents related to the product in the united states a biosimilar version of remicade ®  was introduced in 2016 and additional competitors continue to enter the market sales of infliximab biosimilars in the us market will result in a continued reduction in us sales of remicade ®  

global sales in the company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures 

sales of the company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by thirdparty payers such as government healthcare programs private insurance plans and managed care organizations as part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed in the united states increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers could result in further pricing pressures in addition increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures outside the united states numerous major markets including the eu and japan have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and in that regard directly or indirectly impose price controls limit access to or reimbursement for the company’s products or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection 

the company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses fines and reputational damage 

in the ordinary course of business johnson  johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes product liability and claims that their product sales marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust unfair trade practices andor consumer protection laws the most significant of these proceedings are described in note 21 “legal proceedings” under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report while the company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation the company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters potentially in excess of accruals the resolution of or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period furthermore as a result of cost and availability factors effective november 1 2005 the company ceased purchasing thirdparty product liability insurance 

product reliability safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations lead to litigation and cause reputational damage 

concerns about product safety whether raised internally or by litigants regulators or consumer advocates and whether or not based on scientific evidence can result in safety alerts product recalls governmental investigations regulatory action on the part of the fda or its counterpart in other countries private claims and lawsuits payment of fines and settlements declining sales and reputational damage these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image brand equity and consumer trust in the company’s products product recalls have in the past and could in the future prompt government investigations and inspections the shutdown of manufacturing facilities continued product shortages and related sales declines significant remediation costs reputational damage possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution 

changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the company’s operating results 

changes in tax laws or regulations could negatively impact the company’s effective tax rate and results of operations on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja which resulted in the revaluation of the company’s us related deferred tax assets and liabilities and had an impact on the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the tcja introduces significant changes to us corporate income tax law that will have a meaningful impact on the 

       

  

company’s provision for income taxes accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja requires significant judgments to be made in interpreting its provisions due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the tcja the company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in the financial statements for fiscal year 2017 these provisional amounts are based on the company’s initial analysis of the tcja as of january 18 2018 anticipated guidance from the us treasury about implementing the tcja and the potential for additional guidance from the securities and exchange commission or the financial accounting standards board related to the tcja may result in adjustments to these estimates which could materially affect the company’s financial position and results of operations as well as the effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made 

the government in switzerland is currently considering tax reform legislation which could have a material impact on the company’s effective tax rate if enacted into law 

the company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities in connection with the organization for economic cooperation and development base erosion and profit shifting beps project companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves however any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the company’s expectations which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves 

the company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the company’s businesses 

the company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights determined by patent offices courts and lawmakers in various countries relating to its products and manufacturing processes these rights are essential to the company’s businesses and materially important to the company’s results of operations public policy both within and outside the us has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights the company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the us and other important markets or that such protections once granted will last as long as originally anticipated 

competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation interferences oppositions and other proceedings these proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable in addition challenges that the company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question 

the company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products in the united states manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity or claim noninfringement of innovator products through the abbreviated new drug application or anda process with the fda the biologics price competition and innovation act bpcia enacted in 2010 which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the fda of biosimilar alternatives to innovatordeveloped biological products also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics the inter partes review ipr process with the uspto created under the 2011 america invents act is also being used by competitors to challenge patents held by the company’s subsidiaries for example the key patent for zytiga ®  is currently subject to patent litigation and the uspto has issued a decision invalidating that patent in a related ipr action 

in the event the company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product the company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time current legal proceedings involving the company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in note 21 “legal proceedings—intellectual property” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

the company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the company’s earnings 

the company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets the company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of costeffectiveness technological innovations intellectual property rights product performance real or perceived product advantages pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement the company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions collaborations and licensing 

       

  

agreements with third parties competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the company competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products andor their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the company could negatively impact sales of the company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development 

for the company’s pharmaceutical businesses loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product for the company’s medical device businesses technological innovation product quality reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness development by other companies of new or improved products processes and technologies could threaten to make the company’s products or technologies less desirable less economical or obsolete the company’s consumer businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers’ privatelabel brands if the company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products 

significant challenges or delays in the company’s innovation and development of new products technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the company’s longterm success 

the company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients providers and consumers development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity new products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 22 of 2017 sales the company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire companies products and technologies whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval and if approved whether the products will be commercially successful 

the company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties in all of these contexts developing new products particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices requires significant investment of resources over many years only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products the process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and health care providers’ future needs develop promising new compounds strategies and technologies achieve successful clinical trial results secure effective intellectual property protection obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis and if and when they reach the market successfully differentiate the company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment new products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement even following initial regulatory approval the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real world patient populations as well as market entry of competitive products 

the company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the company to government investigations legal actions and penalties 

like other companies in the healthcare industry the company is subject to extensive regulation investigations and legal action by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which they operate regulatory issues regarding compliance with good manufacturing practices cgmp and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries by manufacturers of drugs devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties product recalls product shortages interruptions in production delays in new product approvals and litigation in addition the marketing pricing and sale of the company’s products are subject to regulation investigations and legal actions including under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the medicaid rebate program federal and state false claims acts state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws increased scrutiny of health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the us and any resulting investigations and prosecutions carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including but not limited to debarment from participation in government healthcare programs any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations the most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in note 21 “legal proceedingsgovernment proceedings” under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

       

  

the company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally 

the company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the us are accompanied by certain financial economic and political risks including those listed below 

foreign currency exchange  in fiscal 2017 approximately 48 of the company’s sales occurred outside of the us with approximately 22 in europe 8 in the western hemisphere excluding the us and 18 in the asiapacific and africa region changes in nonus currencies relative to the us dollar impact the company’s revenues and expenses while the company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations in addition the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the company’s nonus business activity are translated into us dollars 

inflation and currency devaluation risks  the company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates the company has accounted for operations in venezuela as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100 while the company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs productivity improvements and periodic price increases it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation in addition the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the company’s operating results 

illegal importation of pharmaceutical products  the illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the company’s sales and profitability in the us and other countries in which the company operates with the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current us law however the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lowerpriced imports has grown significantly 

antibribery and other regulations the company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials those laws include the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which prohibits us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials also in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore the company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa various jurisdictions in which the company operates have laws and regulations including the uk bribery act 2010 aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior enforcement activities under these laws could subject the company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from health care programs 

other legal social and political risks  other risks inherent in conducting business globally include 

 interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the company’s business sales and reputation 

the company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex highquality components and materials the companys subsidiaries operate 125 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world the company has in the past and may in the future face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action production quality deviations or safety issues labor disputes sitespecific incidents such as fires natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events raw material shortages political unrest and terrorist attacks such 

       

  

delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage 

an information security incident including a cybersecurity breach could have a negative impact to the company’s business or reputation 

to meet business objectives the company relies on both internal information technology it systems and networks and those of third parties and their vendors to process and store sensitive data including confidential research business plans financial information intellectual property and personal data that may be subject to legal protection the extensive information security and cybersecurity threats which affect companies globally pose a risk to the security and availability of these it systems and networks and the confidentiality integrity and availability of the company’s sensitive data the company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection detection and response capabilities as well as ensure the company’s third party providers have required capabilities and controls to address this risk to date the company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks however because of the frequently changing attack techniques along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks there is the potential for the company to be adversely impacted this impact could result in reputational competitive operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action

products acquired from actelion on june 16 2017 

       

  

immunology products achieved sales of 122 billion in 2017 representing an increase of 23 as compared to the prior year growth was driven by strong uptake of stelara ®  ustekinumab the launch of tremfya ® guselkumab and sales growth of simponi ® simponi aria ®  golimumab outside the us lower sales of remicade ® infliximab were due to increased discountsrebates and biosimilar competition

economic and market factors 

the company is aware that its products are used in an environment where for more than a decade policymakers consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care in response to these concerns the company has a longstanding policy of pricing products responsibly for the period 2007  2017 in the united states the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the company’s net price increases for health care products prescription and overthecounter drugs hospital and professional products was below the us consumer price index cpi 

the company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges the company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and consequently on the way companies operate the company has accounted for operations in venezuela as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100 in the face of increasing costs the company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs productivity improvements and periodic price increases 

in june 2016 the united kingdom uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union eu commonly referred to as “brexit” and in march 2017 the uk formally started the process for the uk to leave the eu given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the uk from the eu will have brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty which may cause among other consequences volatility in exchange rates and interest rates additional cost containment by thirdparty payors and changes in regulations however the company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or operating results as of december 31 2017 the business of the company’s uk subsidiaries represented less than 3 of both the company’s consolidated assets and fiscal twelve   months revenues respectively 

the company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates a 1 change in the value of the us dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the company had sales income or expense in 2017 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately 360 million and income by 105 million 

governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates a change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted this change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted 

       

  

the company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales promotions and reimbursement of health care products 

changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services including delaying medical procedures rationing prescription medications reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage as a result of the current global economic downturn may continue to impact the company’s businesses 

the company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights firms have filed abbreviated new drug applications or biosimilar biological product applications with the fda or otherwise challenged the coverage andor validity of the companys patents seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products in the event the company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products and which may result in a noncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset there is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place for further information see the discussion on “remicade ®  related cases” and “litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications” in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

legal proceedings 

johnson  johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability intellectual property commercial and other matters governmental investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business 

the company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 4502025 for these and other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions the ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete proceedings are in early stages matters present legal uncertainties there are significant facts in dispute or there are numerous parties involved 

in the companys opinion based on its examination of these matters its experience to date and discussions with counsel the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings net of liabilities accrued in the companys balance sheet is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position however the resolution of or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period

investments and activities in some countries outside the us are subject to higher risks than comparable us activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to the companys business are generally readily available from multiple sources where there are exceptions the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company 

patents 

the companys subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible they own or are licensed under a significant number of patents in the us and other countries relating to their products product uses formulations and manufacturing processes which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the company in the operation of its businesses the company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products significant legal proceedings and claims involving the companys patent and other intellectual property are described in note 21 “legal proceedings—intellectual property” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

sales of the company’s largest product remicade ®  infliximab accounted for approximately 97 of the companys total revenues for fiscal 2016 accordingly the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the company 

there are two sets of patents related specifically to remicade ®  the first set of patents is coowned by janssen biotech inc a whollyowned subsidiary of johnson  johnson and nyu langone medical center nyu janssen biotech inc has an exclusive license to nyus interests in the patents these patents have expired in all countries outside the united states   in the united states the one remaining patent which expires in september 2018 stands rejected following 

       

  

reexamination proceedings instituted by a third party in the united states patent and trademark office uspto the patent has also been held invalid by the federal district court in the district of massachusetts the decisions by the uspto and the federal district court have been appealed to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit the appeals are pending

the company does not expect that any extensions will be available for the above described patents specifically related to remicade ®  in 2016 a third party received approval from the food and drug administration for sale of its infliximab biosimilar in the united states and introduced its biosimilar to the us market in late 2016 for a more extensive description of legal matters regarding the patents related to remicade ®  see note 21 “legal proceedings – intellectual property – pharmaceutical – remicade ®  related cases” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

in addition to competing in the immunology market with remicade ®  the company is currently marketing stelara ®  ustekinumab simponi ®  golimumab and simponi aria ®  golimumab next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to seven years 

trademarks 

the company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means these trademarks are protected by registration in the us and other countries where such products are marketed the company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses 

seasonality 

worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for advertising and research and development activity 

competition 

in all of their product lines the companys subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved competition in research both internally and externally sourced involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the development of new and innovative products as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the company’s product portfolio is important to the companys success in all areas of its business the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research in addition the development and maintenance of customer demand for the company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion 

research and development 

research activities represent a significant part of the company’s businesses research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering testing and developing new products improving existing products as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch the company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to 91 billion 90 billion and 85 billion for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively research facilities are located in the united states belgium brazil canada china france germany india israel japan the netherlands singapore switzerland and the united kingdom 

environment 

the company is subject to a variety of us and international environmental protection measures the company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations the company’s compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures cash flows earnings or competitive position 

       

  

regulation 

the company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation in the us the drug device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies primarily as to product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the us food and drug administration the fda continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for fda approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the us 

the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world in the us attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or to recommend use or purchase particular medical devices payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally 

us government agencies continue to implement the extensive requirements of the patient protection and affordable care act the aca these have both positive and negative impacts on the us healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the aca and potential modification or repeal of aca provisions will ultimately affect the industry 

the regulatory agencies under whose purview the company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases the company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 

in addition business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the united states by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

further the company relies on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex are subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in the companys products these processes also are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the companys control in addition to the other information in this report and the company’s other filings with the sec investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties if known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize the company’s business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected potentially in a material way 

       

  

one of the company’s key products remicade ®  infliximab is experiencing biosimilar competition which will result in a reduction in us sales of remicade ®  

the company has experienced significant challenges to patents covering its largest product remicade ®  infliximab accounting for approximately 97 of the company’s total revenues for fiscal 2016 and continues to assert certain patents related to the product in april 2016 the fda approved for sale in the united states an infliximab biosimilar to be marketed by a subsidiary of pfizer inc in october 2016 the notice of launch period under the us biologics price competition and innovation act the bpcia passed and in november 2016 pfizer began shipment of an infliximab biosimilar to wholesalers in the united states sales of an infliximab biosimilar in the us market will result in a reduction in us sales of remicade ®  

global sales in the company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures 

sales of the company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by thirdparty payers such as government healthcare programs private insurance plans and managed care organizations as part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed in the united states increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare medicaid and private sector beneficiaries in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers could result in further pricing pressures outside the united states numerous major markets including the eu and japan have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and in that regard directly or indirectly impose price controls limit access to or reimbursement for the company’s products or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection 

the company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses fines and reputational damage 

in the ordinary course of business johnson  johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes product liability and claims that their product sales marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust unfair trade practices andor consumer protection laws the most significant of these proceedings are described in note 21 “legal proceedings” under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report while the company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation the company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters potentially in excess of accruals the resolution of or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period furthermore as a result of cost and availability factors effective november 1 2005 the company ceased purchasing thirdparty product liability insurance 

product reliability safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations lead to litigation and cause reputational damage 

concerns about product safety whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates and whether or not based on scientific evidence can result in safety alerts product recalls governmental investigations regulatory action on the part of the fda or its counterpart in other countries private claims and lawsuits payment of fines and settlements declining sales and reputational damage these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image brand equity and consumer trust in the company’s products product recalls have in the past and could in the future prompt government investigations and inspections the shutdown of manufacturing facilities continued product shortages and related sales declines significant remediation costs reputational damage possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution 

changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the company’s operating results 

changes in tax laws or regulations including tax reform proposals in the us belgium and switzerland could negatively impact the company’s effective tax rate and results of operations a change in statutory tax rate may result in the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the relevant jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted potentially resulting in a material expense or benefit recorded to the company’s consolidated statement of earnings for that period for a discussion of risks of changes in tax rates in other countries including belgium please see “management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition—other information—economic and market factors” in item 7 of this report 

the company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with many tax authorities in connection with the organization for economic cooperation and development base erosion and profit shifting beps project starting in 2017 companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves however any tax authority 

       

  

could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the company’s expectations which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves 

the company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the company’s businesses 

the company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights determined by patent offices courts and lawmakers in various countries relating to its products and manufacturing processes these rights are essential to the company’s businesses and materially important to the company’s results of operations public policy both within and outside the us has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights the company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the us and other important markets or that such protections once granted will last as long as originally anticipated 

competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation interferences oppositions and other proceedings these proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable in addition challenges that the company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question 

the company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products in the united states manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity or claim noninfringement of innovator products through the abbreviated new drug application or anda process with the fda the bpcia enacted in 2010 which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the fda of biosimilar alternatives to innovatordeveloped biological products also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics the inter partes review ipr process with the uspto created under the 2011 america invents act is also being used by competitors to challenge patents held by the company’s subsidiaries for example a key patent for zytiga ®  is currently subject to patent litigation and several ipr proceedings brought by generic companies seeking to invalidate the patent 

in the event the company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product the company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time current legal proceedings involving the company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in note 21 “legal proceedings—intellectual property” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

the company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the company’s earnings 

the company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets the company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of costeffectiveness technological innovations intellectual property rights product performance real or perceived product advantages pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement the company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the company competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products andor their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of us could negatively impact sales of the company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development 

for the company’s pharmaceutical businesses loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product for the company’s medical device businesses technological innovation product quality reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness development by other companies of new or improved products processes and technologies could threaten to make the company’s products or technologies less desirable less economical or obsolete the company’s consumer businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers’ privatelabel brands if the company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products 

       

  

significant challenges or delays in the company’s innovation and development of new products technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the company’s longterm success 

the company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients providers and consumers development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity new products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 22 of 2016 sales the company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire companies products and technologies whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval and if approved whether the products will be commercially successful 

the company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations acquisitions joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties in all of these contexts developing new products particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices requires significant investment of resources over many years only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products the process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and health care providers’ future needs develop promising new compounds strategies and technologies achieve successful clinical trial results secure effective intellectual property protection obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis and if and when they reach the market successfully differentiate the company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment new products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement even following initial regulatory approval the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real world patient populations as well as market entry of competitive products 

the company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the company to government investigations legal actions and penalties 

like other companies in the healthcare industry the company is subject to extensive regulation investigations and legal action by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which they operate regulatory issues regarding compliance with good manufacturing practices cgmp and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries by manufacturers of drugs devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties product recalls product shortages interruptions in production delays in new product approvals and litigation in addition the marketing pricing and sale of the company’s products are subject to regulation investigations and legal actions including under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the medicaid rebate program federal and state false claims acts state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws increased scrutiny of health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the us and any resulting investigations and prosecutions carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including but not limited to debarment from participation in government healthcare programs any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations the most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in note 21 “legal proceedingsgovernment proceedings” under notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

the company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally 

the company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the us are accompanied by certain financial economic and political risks including those listed below 

foreign currency exchange  in fiscal 2016 approximately 47 of the company’s sales occurred outside of the us with approximately 22 in europe 8 in the western hemisphere excluding the us and 17 in the asiapacific and africa region changes in nonus currencies relative to the us dollar impact the company’s revenues and expenses while the company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations in addition the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the company’s nonus business activity are translated into us dollars 

inflation and currency devaluation risks  the company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates the company has accounted for operations in venezuela as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100 while the company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs productivity improvements and periodic price increases it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation in addition the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the company’s operating results 

       

  

illegal importation of pharmaceutical products  the illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the company’s sales and profitability in the us and other countries in which the company operates with the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current us law however the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lowerpriced imports has grown significantly 

antibribery and other regulations the company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials those laws include the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa which prohibits us publicly traded companies from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials also in many countries outside the us the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities therefore the company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa in addition to the us application and enforcement of the fcpa various jurisdictions in which the company operates have laws and regulations including the uk bribery act 2010 aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior enforcement activities under these laws could subject the company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions which could include claims for civil penalties criminal sanctions and administrative remedies including exclusion from health care programs 

other legal social and political risks  other risks inherent in conducting business globally include 

 interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the company’s business sales and reputation 

the company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex highquality components and materials these subsidiaries operate 119 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world the company has in the past and may in the future face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action production quality deviations or safety issues labor disputes sitespecific incidents such as fires natural disasters raw material shortages political unrest and terrorist attacks such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage 

an information security incident including a cybersecurity breach could have a negative impact to the company’s business or reputation 

to meet business objectives the company relies on both internal information technology it systems and networks and those of third parties and their vendors to process and store sensitive data including confidential research business plans financial information intellectual property and personal data the extensive information security and cybersecurity threats which affect companies globally pose a risk to the security and availability of these it systems and networks and the confidentiality integrity and availability of the company’s sensitive data the company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection detection and response capabilities as well as ensure the company’s third party providers have required capabilities and controls to address this risk to date the company has not experienced any material impact to our business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks however because of the frequently changing attack techniques along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks there is the potential for the company to be adversely impacted this impact could result in reputational competitive operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action

concentration of credit risk 

global concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables continues to be limited due to the large number of customers globally and adherence to internal credit policies and credit limits economic challenges in italy spain greece and portugal the southern european region have impacted certain payment patterns which have historically been longer than those experienced in the us and other international markets the total net trade accounts receivable balance in the southern european region was approximately 11 billion as of january 1 2017 and 13 billion as of january 3 2016 approximately 07 billion as of january 1 2017 and approximately 08 billion as of january 3 2016 of the southern european region net trade accounts receivable balance related to the companys consumer vision care and diabetes care businesses as well as certain pharmaceutical and medical devices customers which are in line with historical collection patterns

financing and market risk 

the company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows accordingly the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions a 10 appreciation of the us dollar from the january 1 2017 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the company’s forward contracts by 23 million conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar from the january 1 2017 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the company’s forward contracts by 28 million in either scenario the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows 

the company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency by entering into currency swap contracts a 1 change in the spread between us and foreign interest rates on the company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the company’s swap contracts by approximately 82 million in either scenario at maturity the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows 

the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes further the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty management believes the risk of loss is remote

economic and market factors 

the company is aware that its products are used in an environment where for more than a decade policymakers consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care in response to these concerns the company has a longstanding policy of pricing products responsibly for the period 2006  2016 in the united states the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the company’s net price increases for health care products prescription and overthecounter drugs hospital and professional products was below the us consumer price index cpi 

the company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges the company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and consequently on the way companies operate the company has accounted for operations in venezuela as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100 in the face of increasing costs the company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs productivity improvements and periodic price increases 

the venezuelan government has established alternative systems and offerings of various foreign currency exchanges through the fourth quarter of 2015 the number of the company’s transactions conducted at the official rate declined from prior quarters as a result the company determined that it was no longer likely that all outstanding net monetary assets would be settled at the official government rate of 63 bolivares fuertes to one us dollar therefore in 2015 the company recorded a charge of 161 million to revalue its net monetary assets in venezuela at one of the government’s alternative exchange rates simadi and impair its nonmonetary assets after the revaluation as of january 3 2016 the company’s venezuelan subsidiaries represented less than 01 of the companys consolidated assets and liabilities 

while the company continues to do business in greece the company closely monitors the economic situation as of january 1 2017 the company’s greek subsidiaries represented 03 and 04 of the companys consolidated assets and revenues respectively 

on june 23 2016 the united kingdom uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union eu commonly referred to as “brexit” given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the uk from the eu will have brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty which may cause among other consequences volatility in exchange rates and interest rates additional cost containment by thirdparty payors and changes in regulations however the company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or operating results as of january 1 2017 the business of the company’s uk subsidiaries represented less than 3 of both the company’s consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues 

       

  

the company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates a 1 change in the value of the us dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the company had sales income or expense in 2016 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately 330 million and income by 105 million 

governments around the world including in the united states consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates a change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted this change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the company’s consolidated statement of earnings the company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted 

the belgian government is currently considering a proposed change to its corporate tax code including a proposal to lower its statutory tax rate if enacted the proposed change would result in revaluation of the companys deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to tax expense that may have a material effect on the company’s results of operations for the period based on the deferred tax asset balances as of january 1 2017 the company estimates for every 1 that the statutory tax is lowered there will be additional onetime tax expense of approximately 6075 million a significant portion of the deferred tax asset described as “international rd capitalized for tax” in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements is related to the company’s operations in belgium 

the us government is currently considering various proposals to changes in its corporate tax code these proposals include but are not limited to lowering the statutory tax rate and the rules on how international income earned by the company is taxed in the us the impact of these proposals may have a material effect on the company’s results of operations for the period and on future periods 

as the belgian or us governments are still considering these proposals it is not certain when or if they will be enacted 

the company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales promotions and reimbursement of health care products 

changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services including delaying medical procedures rationing prescription medications reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage as a result of the current global economic downturn may continue to impact the company’s businesses 

the company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights firms have filed abbreviated new drug applications or biosimilar biological product applications with the fda or otherwise challenged the coverage andor validity of the companys patents seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products in the event the company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products and which may result in a noncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset there is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place for further information see the discussion on “remicade ®  related cases” and “litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications” in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

legal proceedings 

johnson  johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability intellectual property commercial and other matters governmental investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business 

the company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 4502025 for these and other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions the ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete proceedings are in early stages matters present legal uncertainties there are significant facts in dispute or there are numerous parties involved 

in the companys opinion based on its examination of these matters its experience to date and discussions with counsel the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings net of liabilities accrued in the companys balance sheet is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position however the resolution of or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows for that period

investments and activities in some countries outside the us are subject to higher risks than comparable us activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to the companys business are generally readily available from multiple sources where there are exceptions the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company 

patents 

the companys subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible they own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the company in the operation of its businesses sales of the company’s largest product remicade ®  infliximab accounted for approximately 94 of the companys total revenues for fiscal 2015 accordingly the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the company 

there are two sets of patents related specifically to remicade ®  infliximab the first set of patents is coowned by janssen biotech inc a whollyowned subsidiary of johnson  johnson and nyu langone medical center nyu janssen biotech inc has an exclusive license to nyus interests in the patents these patents have expired in all countries outside the united states   in the united states the latest of these patents expires in september 2018 and this patent stands rejected and is subject to reexamination proceedings instituted by a third party in the united states patent and trademark office those proceedings are on going 

the second set of patents specifically related to remicade ®  was granted to the kennedy institute of rheumatology in europe canada australia and the united states janssen biotech inc has licenses exclusive for human antitnf antibodies and semiexclusive for nonhuman antitnf antibodies to these patents that expire in 2017 outside of the united 

       

  

states and 2018 in the united states the validity of these patents has been   challenged certain claims have been invalidated and others are under review in various patent offices around the world and are also subject to litigation in canada 

the company does not expect that any additional extensions will be available for the above described patents specifically related to remicade ®  if any of the remicade ®  related patents discussed above is found to be invalid any such patent could not be relied upon to prevent the introduction of biosimilar versions of remicade ®  for a more extensive description of legal matters regarding the patents related to remicade ®  see note 21 “legal proceedings – intellectual property – pharmaceutical – remicade ® related cases” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

in addition to competing in the immunology market with remicade ®  the company is currently marketing stelara ®  ustekinumab simponi ®  golimumab and simponi aria ®  golimumab next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to eight years 

trademarks 

the company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means these trademarks are protected by registration in the united states and other countries where such products are marketed the company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses 

seasonality 

worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for advertising and research and development activity 

competition 

in all of their product lines the companys subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved competition in research both internally and externally sourced involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the development of new and innovative products as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the company’s product portfolio is important to the companys success in all areas of its business the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research in addition the development and maintenance of customer demand for the company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion 

research and development 

research activities represent a significant part of the company’s businesses research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering testing and developing new products improving existing products as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch the company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to 90 billion 85 billion and 82 billion for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively research facilities are located in the united states belgium brazil canada china france germany india israel japan the netherlands singapore switzerland and the united kingdom 

environment 

the company is subject to a variety of us and international environmental protection measures the company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations the company’s compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures cash flows earnings or competitive position 

regulation 

the company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation in the us the drug device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies primarily as to product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the us food and drug administration the fda continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for 

       

  

fda approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the us 

the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world in the us attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or to recommend use or purchase particular medical devices payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally 

us government agencies continue to implement the extensive requirements of the patient protection and affordable care act the aca these have both positive and negative impacts on the us healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the aca will ultimately affect the industry 

the regulatory agencies under whose purview the company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases the company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 

in addition business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the united states by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

further the company relies on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex are subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in the companys products these processes also are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals

concentration of credit risk 

global concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables continues to be limited due to the large number of customers globally and adherence to internal credit policies and credit limits economic challenges in italy spain greece and portugal the southern european region have impacted certain payment patterns which have historically been longer than those experienced in the us and other international markets the total net trade accounts receivable balance in the southern european region was approximately 13 billion as of january 3 2016 and 18 billion as of december 28 2014 approximately 08 billion as of january 3 2016 and approximately 11 billion as of december 28 2014 of the southern european region net trade accounts receivable balance related to the companys consumer vision care and diabetes care businesses as well as certain pharmaceutical and medical devices customers which are in line with historical collection patterns 

the remaining balance of net trade accounts receivable in the southern european region has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments from certain government owned or supported health care customers as well as certain distributors of the pharmaceutical and medical devices local affiliates the total net trade accounts receivable balance for these customers were approximately 05 billion at january 3 2016 and 07 billion at december 28 2014 the company continues to receive payments from these customers and in some cases late payments with interest for customers where payment is expected over periods of time longer than one year revenue and trade receivables have been discounted over the estimated period of time for collection allowances for doubtful accounts have been increased for these customers but have been immaterial to date the company will continue to work closely with these customers on payment plans monitor the economic situation and take appropriate actions as necessary 

financing and market risk 

the company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows accordingly the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions a 10 appreciation of the us dollar from the january 3 2016 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the company’s forward contracts by 15 million conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar from the january 3 2016 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the company’s forward contracts by 18 million in either scenario the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows 

the company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency by entering into currency swap contracts a 1 change in the spread between us and foreign interest rates on the company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the company’s swap contracts by approximately 115 million in either scenario at maturity the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows 

the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes further the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty management believes the risk of loss is remote 

the company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall a 1 100 basis points change in spread on the company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately 314 million 

the company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide in september 2015 the company secured a new 364day credit facility total credit available to the company approximates 10 billion which expires on september 15 2016 interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks the prime rate or london interbank offered rates libor plus applicable margins commitment fees under the agreement are not material 

total borrowings at the end of 2015  and 2014  were 199 billion and 188 billion respectively the increase in borrowings between 2015 and 2014 was a result of financing for the companys share repurchase program in 2015 net cash 

       

  

cash and current marketable securities net of debt was 185 billion compared to net cash of 143 billion in 2014 total debt represented 218 of total capital shareholders’ equity and total debt in 2015 and 212 of total capital in 2014 shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2015  was 2582 compared to 2506 at yearend 2014  an increase of 30

the company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges the company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and consequently on the way companies operate the company has accounted for operations in venezuela as highly inflationary as the prior threeyear cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100 in the face of increasing costs the company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs productivity improvements and periodic price increases 

the venezuelan government has established alternative systems and offerings of various foreign currency exchanges during 2015 the company primarily utilized the official government rate of 63 bolivares fuertes to one us dollar in preparing its consolidated financial statements during 2014 the company applied to settle an outstanding dividend payable at one of the alternative foreign exchange rates as a result the company has applied this alternative exchange rate to translate certain transactions as appropriate through the fourth quarter of 2015 the number of the company’s transactions conducted at the official rate declined from prior quarters as a result the company determined that it was no longer likely that all outstanding net monetary assets would be settled at the official government rate of 63 bolivares fuertes to one us dollar therefore the company recorded a charge of 161 million to revalue its net monetary assets in venezuela at one of the government’s alternative exchange rates simadi and impair its nonmonetary assets after the revaluation as of january 3 2016 the company’s venezuelan subsidiaries represented less than 01 of the companys consolidated assets and liabilities due to continuing uncertain economic conditions in venezuela it is possible that additional charges may be recorded in the future any additional charges are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s 2016 full year results

investments and activities in some countries outside the us are subject to higher risks than comparable us activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to the companys business are generally readily available from multiple sources where there are exceptions the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company 

patents 

the companys subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible they own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the company in the operation of its businesses sales of the company’s largest product remicade ®  infliximab accounted for approximately 92 of the companys total revenues for fiscal 2014 accordingly the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the company 

there are two sets of patents related to remicade ®  infliximab the first set of patents is coowned by janssen biotech inc a whollyowned subsidiary of johnson  johnson and nyu langone medical center nyu janssen biotech inc has an exclusive license to nyus interests in the patents patents have been granted in the united states certain countries in the european union certain of these patents have been extended by supplementary patent certificates and australia   in the united states the latest patent expires in september 2018 the patent expired in canada in march 2012 in certain countries in europe the patent was extended to february 2015 germany spain united kingdom sweden austria belgium switzerland denmark france   greece italy luxembourg and the netherlands in australia the patent expires in august 2015   in the united states the patent expiring in 2018 is subject to reexamination proceedings instituted by a third party those proceedings are ongoing 

the second set of patents related to remicade ®  was granted to the kennedy institute of rheumatology in the united kingdom in europe canada australia and the united states janssen biotech inc has licenses exclusive for human antitnf antibodies and semiexclusive for nonhuman antitnf antibodies to these patents that expire in 2017 outside of the united states and 2018 in the united states the validity of these patents has been   challenged certain claims have been invalidated and others are under review in various patent offices around the world and are also subject to litigation in canada 

the company does not expect that any additional extensions will be available for the patents related to remicade ®  loss of exclusivity will likely result in a reduction in sales as biosimilar versions of remicade ® are introduced to the market 

for legal matters regarding the patents related to remicade ®    see note 21 “legal proceedings” under “notes to consolidated financial statements” of the annual report filed as exhibit 13 to this report on form 10k under the heading “intellectual property  pharmaceutical  remicade ® related cases” 

in addition to competing in the immunology market with remicade ®  the company is currently marketing stelara ®  ustekinumab simponi ®  golimumab and simponi aria ®  golimumab next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to nine years 

trademarks 

the company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means these trademarks are protected by registration in the united states and other countries where such products are marketed the company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses 

seasonality 

worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for advertising and research and development activity 

competition 

in all of their product lines the companys subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally throughout the world competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved competition in research both internally and externally sourced involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the development of new and innovative products is important to the company’s success in all areas of its business this also includes protecting the company’s portfolio of intellectual property the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research in addition the development and maintenance of customer demand for the company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion 

research and development 

research activities represent a significant part of the company’s businesses research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering testing and developing new products improving existing products as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch the company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to 85 billion 82 billion and 77 billion for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively major research facilities are located not only in the united states but also in belgium brazil canada china france germany india israel japan the netherlands singapore switzerland and the united kingdom 

environment 

the company is subject to a variety of us and international environmental protection measures the company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations the company’s compliance with these requirements did not during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures cash flows earnings or competitive position 

regulation 

most of the company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation in the us the drug device diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies primarily as to product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the us food and drug administration the fda continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for fda clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the us 

the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world in the us attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend use or purchase particular medical devices payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to 

drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally 

following the us supreme court decision in june 2012 upholding the patient protection and affordable care act the aca there has been an increase in the pace of regulatory issuances by those us government agencies designated to carry out the extensive requirements of the aca these have both positive and negative impacts on the us healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the aca will ultimately affect the industry 

the regulatory agencies under whose purview the company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases the company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 

in addition business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the united states by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

further the company relies on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex are subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in the companys products and which are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals

investments and activities in some countries outside the united states are subject to higher risks than comparable us activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by restrictive economic policies and political uncertainties 

raw materials 

raw materials essential to the companys business are generally readily available from multiple sources where there are exceptions the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company 

patents and trademarks 

the companys subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible they own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the company in the operation of its businesses sales of the company’s largest product remicade ®  infliximab accounted for approximately 94 of the companys total revenues for fiscal 2013 accordingly the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the company 

there are two sets of patents related to remicade ®  infliximab the first set of patents is coowned by janssen biotech inc a whollyowned subsidiary of johnson  johnson and new york university medical center nyu janssen biotech inc has an exclusive license to nyus interests in the patents patents have been granted in the united states certain countries in the european union certain of these patents have been extended by supplementary patent certificates and australia   in the united states the patent expires in september 2018 these patents expired in canada in march 2012 in certain countries in europe the patent has   been extended to february 2015 germany spain united kingdom sweden austria belgium switzerland denmark france   greece italy luxembourg and the netherlands in australia the patent expires in march 2017   

  

the second set of patents related to remicade ®  was granted to the kennedy institute of rheumatology in the united kingdom in europe canada australia and the united states janssen biotech inc has an exclusive license to these patents which expire in 2017 outside of the united states and 2018 in the united states the validity of these patents has been 

challenged and is currently in litigation 

  

loss of exclusivity for remicade ®  in the abovementioned markets may result in a reduction in sales johnson  johnson does not expect that any additional extensions will be available for the patents related to remicade ®  

in addition to competing in the immunology market with remicade ®  the company is currently marketing stelara ®  ustekinumab simponi ®  golimumab and simponi ®  aria™ golimumab next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of 10 years 

the company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means these trademarks are protected by registration in the united states and other countries where such products are marketed the company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses 

seasonality 

worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for advertising and research and development activity 

competition 

in all of their product lines the companys subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally throughout the world competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved competition in research involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the development of new and innovative products is important to the company’s success in all areas of its business this also includes protecting the company’s portfolio of intellectual property the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research in addition the development and maintenance of customer demand for the company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion 

research and development 

research activities represent a significant part of the company’s businesses research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering testing and developing new products improving existing products as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch the company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to 82 billion 77 billion and 75 billion for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively major research facilities are located not only in the united states but also in belgium brazil canada china france germany india israel japan the netherlands singapore switzerland and the united kingdom 

environment 

the company is subject to a variety of us and international environmental protection measures the company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations the company’s compliance with these requirements did not during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures cash flows earnings or competitive position 

regulation 

most of the company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation in the united states the drug device diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies primarily as to product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the us food and drug administration the fda continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for fda clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the united states 

the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world in the united states attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend use or purchase particular medical devices payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally 

following the us supreme court decision in june 2012 upholding the patient protection and affordable care act the aca there has been an increase in the pace of regulatory issuances by those us government agencies designated to carry out the extensive requirements of the aca these have both positive and negative impacts on the us healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the aca will ultimately affect the industry 

the regulatory agencies under whose purview the company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases the company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 

in addition business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the united states by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties

manufacturing processes which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to johnson  johnson in the operation of its businesses sales of the company’s largest product remicade ® infliximab accounted for 84 of johnson  johnson’s total revenues for fiscal 2011 accordingly the patents related to this product are believed to be material to johnson  johnson

competition 

in all of their product lines johnson  johnson’s operating companies compete with companies both locally and globally throughout the world competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved competition in research involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the development of new and innovative products is important to the company’s success in all areas of its business this also includes protecting the company’s portfolio of intellectual property the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces in addition the development and maintenance of customer demand for the company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion

the united states the drug device diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies primarily as to product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the us food and drug administration the fda continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for fda clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the united states 

the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world in the united states attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend use or purchase particular medical devices payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care 

the regulatory agencies under whose purview johnson  johnson’s operating companies operate have administrative powers that may subject those companies to actions such as product withdrawals recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases johnson  johnson’s operating companies may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 

in addition business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the united states by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 management is required to assess the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report based on that assessment whether the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective

investments and activities in some countries outside the united states are subject to higher risks than comparable us activities because the investment and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies and political uncertainties 

 

raw materials 

 

raw materials essential to johnson  johnson’s operating companies’ businesses are generally readily available from multiple sources 

 

patents and trademarks 

 

johnson  johnson and its subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible they own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to johnson  johnson in the operation of its businesses sales of the company’s largest product remicade ® infliximab accounted for approximately 7 of johnson  johnson’s total revenues for fiscal 2010 accordingly the patents related to this product are believed to be material to johnson  johnson 

 

in march of 2009 topamax ® topiramate lost basic patent protection and market exclusivity and became subject to generic competition in the united states and later in the year in international markets sales of topamax ® declined by 533 and 579 in 2010 and 2009 respectively the next significant patent that will expire is for levaquin ® levofloxacin which accounted for approximately 2 of the company’s 2010 sales a pediatric extension for levaquin ® was granted by the us food and drug administration “fda” which extends market exclusivity in the united states through june 20 2011

seasonality 

 

worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for advertising and research and development activity 

 

competition 

 

in all of their product lines johnson  johnson’s operating companies compete with companies both local and global located throughout the world competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved competition in research involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the development of new and innovative products is important to johnson  johnson’s success in all areas of its business this also includes protecting the company’s portfolio of intellectual property the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces in addition the development and maintenance of customer demand for the company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion 

 

research and development 

 

research activities represent a significant part of johnson  johnson’s subsidiaries’ businesses major research facilities are located not only in the united states but also in belgium brazil canada china france germany india israel japan the netherlands singapore and the united kingdom the costs of worldwide companysponsored research activities relating to the development of new products improvement of existing products technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of consumers and patients excluding purchased inprocess research and development charges for fiscal 2008 amounted to 68 billion 70 billion and 76 billion for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively these costs are charged directly to expense or directly against income in the year in which incurred 

 

environment 

 

johnson  johnson’s operating companies are subject to a variety of us and international environmental protection measures johnson  johnson believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations johnson  johnson’s compliance with these requirements did not during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures cash flows earnings or competitive position 

 

regulation 

 

most of johnson  johnson’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation in the united states the drug device diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies primarily as to product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the fda continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for fda clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the united states 

 

the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world in the united states attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend use or purchase particular medical devices payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care 

 

the regulatory agencies under whose purview johnson  johnson’s operating companies operate have administrative powers that may subject those companies to such actions as product withdrawals recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases johnson  johnson’s operating companies may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 

  in addition business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the united states by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties

investments and activities in some countries outside the united states are subject to higher risks than comparable us activities because the investment and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies and political uncertainties 

 

raw materials

patents and trademarks 

 

johnson  johnson and its operating companies have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible they own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to its products and manufacturing processes which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to johnson  johnson in the operation of its businesses sales of the company’s two largest products risperdal ® and remicade ®  accounted for approximately 6 and 5 of johnson  johnson’s total revenues respectively for fiscal 2007 accordingly the patents related to these products are believed to be material to johnson  johnson as a whole 

 

during 2004 through 2006 duragesic ® fentanyl transdermal fentanyl transdermal system lost its basic patent protection and is subject to generic competition in the united states and certain international markets and the basic patents covering eprex ® epoetin alfa have expired and increased biosimilar competition in international markets is expected duragesic ® fentanyl transdermal sales declined by 101 to 12 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to the impact of generic competition combined sales of duragesic ® fentanyl transdermal and eprex ® accounted for approximately 4 of johnson  johnson’s worldwide sales in 2007 the material patents that expired in 2007 or will expire in 2008 are related to risperdal ®  which expired in the united states in december 2007 and topamax ®  which is scheduled to expire in the united states in september 2008 the company has received a pediatric extension for risperdal ® oral from the fda which grants market exclusivity in the united states through june 2008 the company is on target to file for a pediatric extension for topamax ®  which if obtained from the fda would grant market exclusivity in the united states until march 2009 

johnson  johnson’s operating companies have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means these trademarks are protected by registration in the united states and other countries where such products are marketed johnson  johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses 

 

seasonality 

 

worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for advertising and research and development activity 

 

competition 

 

in all of their product lines johnson  johnson’s operating companies compete with companies both large and small located throughout the world competition is strong in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved competition in research involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the development of new and improved products is important to johnson  johnson’s success in all areas of its businesses this also includes protecting the company’s portfolio of intellectual property the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and multiple sales forces in addition the development and maintenance of customer acceptance of the products of johnson  johnson’s consumer businesses involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion 

 

research and development 

 

research activities represent a significant part of johnson  johnson’s subsidiaries’ businesses major research facilities are located not only in the united states but also in australia belgium brazil canada china france germany india japan the netherlands singapore and the united kingdom the costs of worldwide companysponsored research activities relating to the development of new products improvement of existing products technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of consumers and patients excluding inprocess research and development charges amounted to 7680 million 7125 million and 6462 million for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively these costs are charged directly to income in the year in which incurred 

 

environment 

 

johnson  johnson’s operating companies are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental protection measures johnson  johnson believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations johnson  johnson’s compliance with these requirements did not during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures cash flows earnings or competitive position 

 

regulation 

 

most of johnson  johnson’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation in the united states the drug device diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies primarily as to product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the fda continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for fda clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the united states 

 

the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world in the united states attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend use or purchase particular medical devices payers have become a more potent force in the market 

place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care in the united states implementation of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the deficit reduction act of 2005 may cause uncertainty in reimbursement levels in certain product segments 

 

the regulatory agencies under whose purview johnson  johnson’s operating companies operate have administrative powers that may subject those companies to such actions as product withdrawals recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases johnson  johnson’s operating companies may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 

 

in addition business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the united states by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties

  johnson  johnson has made a practice of selling its products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means johnson  johnson’s trademarks are protected by registration in the united states and other countries where its products are marketed johnson  johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its business seasonality   worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for advertising and research grants competition   in all of their product lines johnson  johnson companies compete with companies both large and small located throughout the world competition is strong in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved competition in research involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant the development of new and improved products is important to johnson  johnson’s success in all areas of its business this competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and multiple sales forces in addition the development and maintenance of customer acceptance of the products of johnson  johnson’s consumer businesses involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion research and development   research activities represent a significant part of johnson  johnson’s business major research facilities are located not only in the united states but also in australia belgium brazil canada china france germany india japan the netherlands singapore and the united kingdom the costs of worldwide companysponsored research activities relating to the development of new products improvement of existing products technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of consumers and patients excluding inprocess research and development charges amounted to 7125 million 6462 million and 5344 million for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively these costs are charged directly to income in the year in which incurred environment   johnson  johnson companies are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental protection measures johnson  johnson believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations johnson  johnson’s compliance with these requirements did not during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures cash flows earnings or competitive position regulation   most of johnson  johnson’s business is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation in the united states the drug device diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies primarily as to product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the fda continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for fda clearance of new drugs and devices 3   and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the united states 

  the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world in the united states attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend use or purchase particular medical devices payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care in the united states implementation of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the deficit reduction act of 2005 may cause uncertainty in reimbursement levels in certain product segments   the regulatory agencies under whose purview johnson  johnson companies operate have administrative powers that may subject those companies to such actions as product withdrawals recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in some cases johnson  johnson’s operating companies may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls   in addition business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny particularly in the united states by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties

culture the products sold in international business include not only those
which were developed in the united states but also those which were developed by
subsidiaries abroad

     investments and activities in some countries outside the united states are
subject to higher risks than comparable us activities because the investment
and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies and
political uncertainties

raw materials

     raw materials essential to johnson  johnsons operating companies
businesses are generally readily available from multiple sources

patents and trademarks

     johnson  johnson has made a practice of obtaining patent protection on its
products and processes where possible johnson  johnson owns or is licensed
under a number of patents relating to its products and manufacturing processes
which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the
operation of its business sales of the companys two largest products procrit
and risperdal each accounted for over 5 of johnson  johnsons total revenues
for 2004 accordingly the patents related to these products are believed to be
material in relation to johnson  johnson as a whole

     during 2004 and 2005 duragesic fentanyl transdermal system in the united
states and eprex in international markets have lost or will lose their basic
patent protection and will be subject to generic competition the pediatric
exclusivity for the duragesic patent expired in the us in january 2005 the
first generic version of duragesic has been launched foreign patent protection
related to duragesic will expire during 2005 the company expects that duragesic
sales will decline in 2005 as compared to 2004

     during 2004 patents related to eprex in certain international markets
expired generic competition will be limited in the near term due to the lack of
biologically equivalent compounds sales of duragesic and eprex accounted for
over 7 of johnson  johnsons worldwide sales in 2004 there are no other major
product patents that are scheduled to expire during the next 2 years

     johnson  johnson has made a practice of selling its products under
trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available
means johnson  johnsons trademarks are protected by registration in the
united states and other countries where its products are marketed johnson 
johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance
in the operation of its business

                                        2
page

seasonality

     worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality
however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for
advertising and research grants

competition

     in all of their product lines johnson  johnson companies compete with
companies both large and small located in the united states and abroad
competition is strong in all lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved competition in research involving the development
of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and
processes is particularly significant and results from time to time in product
and process obsolescence the development of new and improved products is
important to johnson  johnsons success in all areas of its business this
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research
and in multiple sales forces in addition the winning and retention of customer
acceptance of the products of johnson  johnsons consumer businesses involve
heavy expenditures for advertising promotion and selling

research

     research activities are important to all segments of johnson  johnsons
business major research facilities are located not only in the united states
but also in australia belgium brazil canada and the united kingdom the costs
of johnson  johnsons worldwide research activities relating to the development
of new products the improvement of existing products technical support of
products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of the
consumer amounted to 5203 4684 and 3957 million for fiscal years 2004
2003 and 2002 respectively these costs are charged directly to income in the
year in which incurred all research was sponsored by johnson  johnson

environment

     during the past year johnson  johnson companies were subject to a variety
of federal state and local environmental protection measures johnson  johnson
believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable
environmental laws and regulations johnson  johnsons compliance with these
requirements did not and is not expected to have a material effect upon its
capital expenditures cash flows earnings or competitive position

regulation

     most of johnson  johnsons business is subject to varying degrees of
governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and
the general trend is toward regulation of increasing stringency in the united
states the drug device diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been
subject to regulation by various federal state and local agencies primarily as
to product safety efficacy advertising and labeling the exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the food and drug administration the fda continues to
result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for fda
clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense
of product introduction similar trends toward product and process regulation
are also evident in a number of major countries outside of the united states
especially in the european economic community where efforts are continuing to
harmonize the internal regulatory systems

     the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of
study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative
bodies in the united states and other countries in the united states attention
has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors
to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend particular medical
devices managed care has become a more potent force in the market place and it
is likely that increased attention will be paid to drug and medical device
pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality of
health care there is also

                                        3
page

uncertainty as to the impact of the medicare prescription drug improvement and
modernization act which was enacted in the latter part of 2003

     the regulatory agencies under whose purview johnson  johnson operates have
administrative powers that may subject johnson  johnson to such actions as
product recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in
some cases johnson  johnson may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls
voluntarily

     in addition sales marketing and other business practices in the health
care industry have come under increased scrutiny by government agencies and
state attorney generals and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the
risk of significant civil and criminal penalties

     while the companys affiliates do not sell any cox2 inhibitor medicines
the recent developments involving those medicines such as vioxx and celebrex
are likely to have implications throughout the health care industry

     raw materials essential to johnson  johnsons operating companies
businesses are generally readily available from multiple sources

patents and trademarks

     johnson  johnson has made a practice of obtaining patent protection on its
products and processes where possible johnson  johnson owns or is licensed
under a number of patents relating to its products and manufacturing processes
which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the
operation of its business sales of procrit and risperdal each accounted for
over 5 of johnson  johnsons total revenues for 2003 accordingly the patents
related to these products are believed to be material in relation to johnson 
johnson as a whole

     during the next two years eprex duragesic and certain contraceptive
products have or will lose their basic patent protection and will be subject to
generic competition the expiration of a product patent typically results in a
loss of market exclusivity and can result in a significant reduction in sales

annual worldwide sales

trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available
means johnson  johnsons trademarks are protected by registration in the

johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance
in the operation of its business

seasonality

     worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality
however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for
advertising and research grants

companies both large and small located in the united states and abroad
competition is strong in all lines without regard to the number and

                                        2
page

size of the competing companies involved competition in research involving the
development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing
products and processes is particularly significant and results from time to
time in product and process obsolescence the development of new and improved
products is important to johnson  johnsons success in all areas of its
business this competitive environment requires substantial investments in
continuing research and in multiple sales forces in addition the winning and
retention of customer acceptance of the products of johnson  johnsons consumer
businesses involve heavy expenditures for advertising promotion and selling

of federal state and local environmental protection measures johnson  johnson

requirements did not and is not expected to have a material effect upon its
capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

regulation

     most of johnson  johnsons business is subject to varying degrees of
governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and
the general trend is toward regulation of increasing stringency in the united
states the drug device diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been
subject to regulation by various federal state and local agencies primarily as
to product safety efficacy advertising and labeling the exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the food and drug administration the fda continues to
result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for fda
clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense
of product introduction similar trends toward product and process regulation
are also evident in a number of major countries outside of the united states
especially in the european economic community where efforts are continuing to
harmonize the internal regulatory systems

     the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of
study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative
bodies in the united states and other countries in the united states attention
has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors
to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend particular medical
devices managed care has become a more potent force in the market place and it
is likely that increased attention will be paid to drug and medical device
pricing appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality of
health care there is also uncertainty as to the impact of the medicare
prescription drug improvement and modernization act which was enacted in the
latter part of 2003

     the regulatory agencies under whose purview johnson  johnson operates have
administrative powers that may subject johnson  johnson to such actions as
product recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in
some cases johnson  johnson may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls
voluntarily

     in addition sales and marketing practices in the health care industry have
come under increased scrutiny by government agencies and state attorney generals
and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant
civil and criminal penalties

culture the products sold in the international business include not only those
which were developed in the united states but also those which were developed by
subsidiaries abroad

     investments and activities in some countries outside the united states are
subject to higher risks than comparable domestic activities because the
investment and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies
and political uncertainties

in the operation of its business

seasonality

     worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality
however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for
advertising and research grants

competition

     in all its product lines johnson  johnson companies compete with
companies both large and small located in the united states and abroad
competition is strong in all lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved competition in research involving the development
of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and
processes is particularly significant and results from time to time in product
and process obsolescence the development of new and improved products is
important to johnson  johnsons success in all areas of its business this
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research
and in multiple sales forces in addition the winning and retention of customer
acceptance of johnson  johnsons consumer products involve heavy expenditures
for advertising promotion and selling

research

united kingdom the costs of johnson  johnsons worldwide research activities

3105 million for fiscal years 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively these costs

state and local environmental protection measures johnson  johnson believes
that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable
environmental laws and regulations johnson  johnsons compliance with these
requirements did not and is not expected to have a material effect upon its
capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

regulation

     most of johnson  johnsons business is subject to varying degrees of
governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and
the general trend is toward regulation of increasing stringency in the united
states the drug device diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been
subject to regulation by various federal state and local agencies primarily as
to product safety efficacy advertising and labeling the exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the food and drug administration the fda

                                        3

continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation
required for fda clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase
in the expense of product introduction similar trends toward product and
process regulation are also evident in a number of major countries outside of
the united states especially in the european economic community where efforts
are continuing to harmonize the internal regulatory systems

     the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of
study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative
bodies in the united states and other countries in the united states attention
has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors
to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend particular medical
devices even in the absence of new government regulation managed care has
become a more potent force in the market place and it is likely that increased
attention will be paid to drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and
medical device utilization and the quality of health care

     the regulatory agencies under whose purview johnson  johnson operates have
administrative powers that may subject johnson  johnson to such actions as
product recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in
some cases johnson  johnson may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls
voluntarily

however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters this reflects increased spending decisions principally for

companies both large and small located in the united states and abroad
competition is strong in all lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved competition in research involving the development
of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and
processes is particularly significant and results from time to time in product
and process obsolescence the development of new and improved products is
important to johnson  johnsons success in all areas of its business this
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research
and in multiple sales forces in addition the winning and retention of customer
acceptance of johnson  johnsons consumer products involve heavy expenditures
for advertising promotion and selling

capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

regulation

     most of johnson  johnsons business is subject to varying degrees of
governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted and
the general trend is toward regulation of increasing stringency in the united
states the drug device diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been
subject to regulation by various federal state and local agencies primarily as
to product safety efficacy advertising and labeling the exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the food and drug administration the fda

                                        3

continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation
required for fda clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase
in the expense of product introduction similar trends toward product and
process regulation are also evident in a number of major countries outside of
the united states especially in the european economic community where efforts
are continuing to harmonize the internal regulatory systems

     the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of
study investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative
bodies in the united states and other countries in the united states attention
has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors
to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend particular medical
devices even in the absence of new government regulation managed care has
become a more potent force in the market place and it is likely that increased
attention will be paid to drug and medical device pricing appropriate drug and
medical device utilization and the quality of health care

     the regulatory agencies under whose purview johnson  johnson operates have
administrative powers that may subject johnson  johnson to such actions as
product recalls seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions in
some cases johnson  johnson may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls
voluntarily
