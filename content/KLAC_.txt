industry 

kla’s core focus is enabling technological advances as well as improving manufacturing yields in the semiconductor industry the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer  a round disk that is typically 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is highly sophisticated and involves the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish other more specialized wafers such as epitaxial silicon “epi” silicon on insulator “soi” gallium nitride “gan” and silicon carbide “sic” are also common in the semiconductor industry 

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a semiconductor chip or “semiconductor” is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times the majority of chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions and the upper “interconnect” structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality the wafer is then cut into individual chips and the chips that pass functional testing are packaged final testing is performed on all packaged chips packaged chips are then mounted onto pcbs for connection to the rest of the electronic system additionally fpds are manufactured using processes similar to ics eg film deposition photolithography etching except using glass as the starting substrate 

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor semiconductorrelated and electronic device manufacturers which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ics products utilizing ics and other electronic components we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it has historically been cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor semiconductorrelated and electronic device manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor or other industries in which we operate or slowdowns in the worldwide economy as well as customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and advancing new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to highvolume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies some requiring new substrate and film materials new geometries new transistor architectures new power distribution schemes advanced multipatterning optical and extreme ultraviolet “euv” lithography and advanced packaging techniques while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of semiconductor manufacturing significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected the adoption of these technologies into highvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects device performance characteristics namely speed capacity or power management also become more sensitive to parameters such as linewidth and film thickness variation new process materials require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face the continuing evolution of semiconductors to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced ic fabrication facility today can cost well above 10 billion substantially more than previousgeneration facilities in addition chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is currently experiencing multiple growth drivers bolstered by demand for semiconductors from leading edge foundry and logic manufacturers to support computational power and connectivity for markets such as artificial intelligence “ai” and 5g wireless technology growth of virtual engagement and the pace of digitization have been driven by covid19 related travel restrictions and quarantines work from home requirements and advances in healthcare and industrial applications these factors together with the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and intelligence in automobiles are powering leadingedge design node technology investments and capacity expansions intertwined in these areas spurred by the requirements of big data is the growth in demand for memory chips regionalization of semiconductors has become a trend as access to semiconductors is viewed from the lens of national security china continues to emerge as a major region for the manufacturing of logic and memory chips adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ics government initiatives are propelling china to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity although china is currently seen as an important longterm growth region for the semiconductor capital equipment sector the us department of commerce “commerce” has added certain chinabased entities to the us entity list restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without a license in addition commerce has imposed export licensing requirements on chinabased customers engaged in military end uses as well as requiring our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on us technology to manufacture products connected to huawei or its affiliates while these new rules have not significantly impacted our operations to date such actions by the us government or another country could impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers and adversely affect our business 

research and development 

the market for semiconductor and electronics industries is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we make significant investments in product rd for the timely development of new products and enhancements necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to rd programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs 

our key rd activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 involved the development of process control and processenabling solutions for a broad range of industries including semiconductors pcbs and displays for information regarding our rd expenses during the last three fiscal years see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product rd even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to enhance our competitive position 

customers 

we count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor semiconductorrelated and electronic device manufacturers in asia the us and europe our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the us and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 2021 and 2020 the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues primarily in the semiconductor process control segment 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are aimed at building deep longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing comprehensive resources for the full breadth of process control processenabling and yield management solutions for manufacturing and testing wafers and reticles ics packaging lightemitting diodes “led” power devices compound semiconductor devices mems data storage pcbs and flat and flexible panel displays as well as general materials research our revenues are derived primarily from product sales and related service contracts mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in asia the us and europe we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to meet the requirements of commerce and the us department of state 

in addition to sales and service offices in the us we conduct sales marketing and services out of subsidiaries or branches in many countries some of the largest include china germany israel japan korea singapore taiwan and the united kingdom we believe that sales outside the us will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues international revenues accounted for approximately 90 89 and 89 of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 19 “segment reporting and geographic information” to our consolidated financial statements 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in nonus dollar product sales through hedging activities there can be 

no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in item 1a “risk factors” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results

a range of industries including general scientific and materials research and optoelectronics require measurements of surface topography and film thickness to either control their processes or research new material characteristics these general purpose and lab applications tools are offered under our kla instruments™ brand 



the specialty semiconductor process segment develops and sells advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools which are used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers including manufacturers of mems rf communication chips and power semiconductors for automotive and industrial applications the pcb display and component inspection segment enables electronic device manufacturers to inspect test and measure pcbs fpds and packaged ics to verify their quality pattern the desired electronic circuitry on the relevant substrate and perform threedimensional shaping of metalized circuits on multiple surfaces the specialty semiconductor process and pcb display and component inspection segments offer a variety of solutions and products including 



services 

our service programs enable our customers in all business sectors to maintain the high performance and productivity of our products through a flexible array of service options whether a manufacturing site is producing wafers reticles ics display or pcb products our highly trained service teams collaborate with customers to determine the best products and services to meet technology and business requirements 

backlog 

our backlog which represents our performance obligation to deliver products and services totaled 1311 billion and 469 billion as of june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received we expect to recognize approximately 40 to 50 of these performance obligations as revenue beyond the next 12 months but this estimate is subject to constant change depending on the following supply chain constraints customer slot change requests as well as pushouts and cancellations usually with limited or no penalties and potential elevated demand levels which could require even longer lead times the growth that we have experienced over the past few years has resulted in higher levels of backlog the supply chain disruptions caused by the ongoing pandemic as well as favorable market trends have led to customers agreeing to purchase equipment from us with lead times that are longer than our historical experience as the lead times for delivery of our equipment get longer the risk increases that customers may choose to change their equipment orders due to the evolution of the customers technological production or market needs this could result in order modifications rescheduling or even cancellations that may not be communicated to us in a timely manner causing backlog to remain elevated until agreed with the customer customer communication delays for orders already placed could affect our ability to respond quickly in weakening demand environments which could harm our results of operations 

because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods the historical cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between on the one hand our ability to manufacture deliver and install products and on the other the requirements of our customers in our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources management of our operating model and other factors we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries and installations of products which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our 

finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in the us singapore israel germany united kingdom italy and china our supply chain strategy adheres to ethical labor practices responsible minerals sourcing and responsible business alliance and semi guidelines 

some critical parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications while other parts are standard commercial products we use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers through our business interruption planning we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by among other things monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials providing financial support and incentives to encourage vendors to increase capacity when required identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources or disruptions within our suppliers’ often complex supply chains could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for technologically advanced process control processenabling and yield management solutions used by semiconductor and electronics manufacturers is highly competitive with important competitive factors including system performance ease of use reliability technical service and support and overall cost of ownership however we believe that while the competitive factors listed are important the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated capabilities into their existing development and manufacturing processes to enhance productivity improve yields and reduce waste to remain competitive we use significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product rd in each of our product markets we have many competitors including companies such as applied materials inc asml holding nv hitachi hightechnologies corporation onto innovation inc and lasertec inc some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics we may also face future competition from new market entrants overseas or domestically we maintain our market position by building longterm relationships with our customers to meet their dynamic needs as well as anticipating future market demands and enabling our customers to accelerate adoption and production of new technologies as discussed further in the “industry” section of this item 1 management believes that we are well positioned in the market with our industryleading portfolio of products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenue gross margin and market share should this occur it could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the us and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under us and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business no single patent copyright or trade secret is essential to us as a whole or to any of our business segments 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no 

assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

government regulations 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local governmental laws and regulations worldwide including laws and regulations related to anticorruption antitrust data privacy employment environmental foreign exchange controls health and safety immigration importexport intellectual property and tax compliance with these laws and regulations did not have in fiscal 2022 and is not expected to have in fiscal 2023 a material effect on our capital expenditures financial condition results of operations or competitive position 

however any failure to comply with laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate in the case of environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials our failure to comply with laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities

most of our employees are also required to take annual training courses and regular certifications related to their work including those pertaining to the environment data privacy and workplace health and safety 

employee engagement 

we conduct regular employee surveys to check in with our global workforce and obtain input on several topics the feedback we receive from these surveys helps us assess employee sentiment identify areas of improvement and guides our decisionmaking as it relates to people management in addition our executives conduct regular weekly and quarterly webcasts these global webcasts enable all employees to engage with senior leaders and ask questions in an open qa session 

as we began to emerge from the global pandemic in fiscal 2022 in parts of the world many employees sought connection as never before through our annual employee engagement surveys which had an 85 response rate in fiscal year 2022 we identified the top priorities in a postpandemic world we created action plans to act on these priorities and engaged our workforce in identifying potential solutions to address these top concerns even though our survey rated our level of engagement as being “good” we realize that we have several opportunities for improvement and will continue to involve our employees in seeking ways we can get even better 

employee health and safety and pandemic response 

the health and safety of our employees is paramount to our success we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all employees we accomplish this through strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety including recognition and control of workplace hazards tracking injury and illness rates utilizing a global travel health program and maintaining detailed emergency and disaster recovery plans 

kla’s top priority during the covid19 pandemic has been and continues to be protecting the health and safety of our employees and their families our customers and our community the continuing demands of covid19 required that we build upon our global approach to employee health and safety “ehs” with strong collaboration across the regions this has resulted in the adoption of best practices for each of our sites improving business resiliency and ehs worldwide in addition our flexible work options have enabled employees to remain safely at home during quarantines to support their families and prevent crosscontamination in the workplace through this period we continued the implementation of an infectious disease playbook work from home programs health check protocols screenings for all employees working onsite new process workflows at physical sites to ensure reduced contact for employees working onsite contact tracing processes and protocols quarantining and testing protocols for exposure and positive tests onsite vaccination clinics travel guidelines and protocols to ensure employees who must travel for work can do so safely and phased returntowork plans and approval processes to enable nonmanufacturing employees to returntowork when permitted by local government regulations 

our goal is always zero accidents across our facilities and to achieve that we proactively conduct risk assessments and audits to constantly improve our efforts we implemented a global standard for our incidents to ensure consistency across our regions and continually outperform industry averages for injury rates we are committed to reducing safety risks across business units and at corporate sites worldwide we revised our approach to risk assessments to “risk rank” our own operations we are utilizing this system not only to measure our own performance but also to help improve the performance in our supply chain and with our customers our excellent safety record is a tribute to our employees efforts the breadth and depth of our training programs and our dedication to safety policy management all new hires are required to complete a health and safety training program in addition our service technicians are required to achieve and maintain rolespecific safety training certifications

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the current covid19 pandemic and the potential aftereffects from it could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations  

the covid19 pandemic has caused substantial global disruptions including in the jurisdictions where we conduct business and may cause additional disruptions in the future which are impossible to predict local regional and national authorities in numerous jurisdictions have implemented a variety of measures designed to slow the spread of the virus including social distancing guidelines quarantines banning of nonessential travel and requiring the cessation of nonessential activities on the premises of businesses in 2022 the chinese government implemented lockdowns in two of its larger economic hubs shenzhen and shanghai lockdowns in major economic hubs such as shenzhen and shanghai have led to additional supply chain challenges and could cause delays in the delivery of goods in or around impacted areas which could both harm our ability to obtain components for our products in a timely manner delay the delivery of our products in and around those areas delay installation of our products in those areas or affect customer acceptance processes due to resource mobility restrictions any delays in delivering or installing our products could adversely impact the timing of our revenue recognition while all of our global manufacturing sites are currently operational any local pandemic outbreaks or the advent of new variants could require us to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates 

despite the wide availability of covid19 vaccines in the us and in other parts of the world we are unable to predict how effective they will continue to be in preventing the spread of covid19 including its variant strains in addition although there has been improvement in the global economy since the severe effects of the covid19 pandemic at its onset many macroeconomic variables remain dynamic and we continue to experience constraints in our supply chain as discussed below 

some of the risks associated with the pandemic or a worsening of the pandemic in the future include 

• cancellation or reduction of routes available from common carriers which may cause delays in our ability to deliver or service our products or receive components from suppliers necessary to manufacture or service our products 

• shortages or disruption in the supply chain could affect our ability to procure components for our products on a timely basis or at all or could require us to commit to increased purchases and provide longer lead times to secure critical components which could increase inventory obsolescence risk refer to the executive summary in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for additional information on supply constraints related to the covid19 pandemic 

• travel bans lockdowns or the requirement to quarantine for a lengthy period after entering a jurisdiction which may delay our ability to install the products we sell or service those products following installation 

• governmental orders or employee exposure requiring us our customers or our suppliers to discontinue manufacturing products at our or their respective facilities for a period of time 

• continued volatility and uncertainty in customer demand for our products delivery pushouts or cancellation of orders by our customers caused by a global recession resulting from the pandemic and the measures implemented by authorities to slow the spread of covid19 

• increased costs or inability to acquire components necessary for the manufacture of our products due to reduced availability or rising inflation 

• absence of liquidity at customers and suppliers caused by disruptions from the pandemic which may hamper the ability of customers to pay for the products they purchase on time or at all or hamper the ability of our suppliers to continue to supply components to us in a timely manner or at all and 

• loss of efficiencies due to remote working requirements for our employees 

if any of the foregoing risks occur or intensify during this pandemic our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

commercial operational financial and regulatory risks 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the us and we maintain significant operations outside the us we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the us and we maintain significant operations outside the us we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges including but not limited to 

• global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses trade sanctions tariffs and international trade disputes 

• political and social attitudes laws rules regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over nondomestic companies including customer or governmentsupported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors 

• ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries 

• managing cultural diversity and organizational alignment 

• exposure to the unique characteristics of each region in the global market which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period 

• periodic local or international economic downturns 

• potential adverse tax consequences including withholding tax rules that may limit the repatriation of our earnings and higher effective income tax rates in foreign countries where we do business 

• compliance with customs regulations in the countries in which we do business 

• existing and potentially new tariffs or other trade restrictions and barriers including those applied to our products spare parts and services or to parts and supplies that we purchase 

• political instability natural disasters legal or regulatory changes acts of war such as russia’s invasion of ukraine or terrorism in regions where we our customers or our suppliers have operations or where we or they do business 

• rising inflation and fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may adversely impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business although we attempt to manage some of our nearterm currency risks through the use of hedging instruments there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate 

• our ability to receive prepayments for certain of our products and services sold in certain jurisdictions these prepayments increase our cash flows for the quarter in which they are received if our practice of requiring prepayments in those jurisdictions changes or deteriorates our cash flows would be harmed 

• longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable outside of the us 

• difficulties in managing foreign distributors including monitoring and ensuring our distributors’ compliance with applicable laws and 

• inadequate protection or enforcement of our intellectual property and other legal rights in foreign jurisdictions 

in addition government controls either by the us or other countries that restrict our business overseas or restrict our ability to import or export our products and services or increase the cost of our operations through the imposition of broad sanctions trade restrictions tariffs new controls outright bans or otherwise could harm our business for example commerce has added numerous chinabased entities to the us entity list including fujian jinhua integrated circuit company ltd huawei and semiconductor manufacturing international corporation restricting our ability to provide products and services to 

such entities without an export license even if we apply for licenses to sell our products or provide services to companies on commerce’s us entity list there can be no assurance that licenses will be granted in addition commerce has imposed export licensing requirements on chinabased customers engaged in military end uses or where commerce has determined there is a risk of diversion to a military end use as well as requiring our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on us technology to manufacture products connected to huawei or its affiliates to date these rules have not significantly impacted our operations but we are continually monitoring their impact if additional companies are added to commerce’s us entity list or other licensing requirements or restrictions are imposed thereby limiting our ability to sell our products or services to other customers in china our business could be significantly harmed similar actions by the us government or another country could impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers 

any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy 

demand for our products is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending and can cause our customers to decrease cancel or delay their equipment and service orders the tightening of credit markets rising interest rates and concerns regarding the availability of credit can make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell reduced demand combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of such financing has at times in the past adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels 

in addition a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and where applicable credit ratings of such investments a decline in the capital and financial markets or rising interest rates would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity if the market value of such investments were to decline or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

we might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property or other confidential information that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the industries in which we serve from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information in addition we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties with respect to intellectual property infringement disputes our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however there can be no assurance that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition furthermore we may potentially be subject to claims by customers suppliers or other business partners or by governmental law enforcement agencies related to our receipt distribution andor use of thirdparty intellectual property or confidential information legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit and associated internal investigations with respect to intellectual property or confidential information disputes are often expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert management’s attention and other company resources andor may result in restrictions on our ability to sell our products settlements on significantly adverse terms or adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines any of which could have a significant negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings claims or investigations the instigation of legal proceedings or claims our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims or the determination of any adverse findings against us or any of our employees in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our business reputation 

we are exposed to various risks related to the legal regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to compliance with laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust anticorruptionantibribery unclaimed property economic sanctions and export control regulations we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable law but there can be no assurance our policies and procedures will prove completely effective in ensuring compliance by all our personnel business partners and representatives for whose misconduct we may under some circumstances be legally responsible our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in government investigations andor enforcement actions which could result in significant financial cost including investigation expenses defense costs assessments and criminal or civil penalties reputational harm and other consequences that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business for instance in response to russia’s invasion of ukraine the us european union and other countries have imposed sanctions against russia belarus and certain other regions entities and individuals and may impose additional sanctions export controls or other measures the imposition of sanctions export controls and other measures could adversely impact our business including preventing us from performing existing contracts recognizing revenue pursuing new business opportunities or receiving payment for products already supplied or services already performed with customers 

additionally we are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations including those that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions some of these laws impose strict liability for certain releases which may require us to incur costs regardless of fault or the legality of actions at the time of release in addition changes in environmental laws and regulations including any relating to climate change and greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions could require us or others in our value chain to install additional equipment alter operations to incorporate new technologies or processes or revise process inputs among other things which may cause us to incur significant costs or otherwise adversely impact our business performance various agencies and governmental bodies have expressed particular interest in promulgating rules relating to climate change for example in march 2022 the sec published a proposed rule that would require companies to provide significantly expanded climaterelated disclosures in their form 10k which may require us to incur significant additional costs to comply and impose increased oversight obligations on our management and board of directors we also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the composition of our products including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources production methods or provenance of certain metals and other materials the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business 

from time to time we may receive inquiries subpoenas investigative demands or audit notices from governmental or regulatory bodies or we may make voluntary disclosures related to legal regulatory or tax compliance matters and these matters may result in significant financial cost including investigation expenses defense costs assessments and criminal or civil penalties reputational harm and other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be subject to new or amended laws including laws that conflict with other applicable laws which may impose compliance challenges and create the risk of noncompliance 

in addition we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment immigration contracts product performance product liability antitrust environmental regulations securities unfair competition and other matters these legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit our ability to sell our products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims which could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

increasing attention to esg matters including any targets or other esg initiatives could result in additional costs or risks or adversely impact our business 

certain investors capital providers shareholder advocacy groups other market participants customers and other stakeholder groups have focused increasingly on companies’ esg initiatives including those regarding climate change human rights and id among others this may result in increased costs changes in demand for certain types of products enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations and costs or other adverse impacts on our business financial condition or results of operations 

from time to time we create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding esg matters identification assessment and disclosure of such matters is complex many of the statements in such voluntary disclosures are based on our expectations and assumptions which may require substantial discretion and forecasts about costs and future circumstances additionally expectations regarding companies’ management of esg matters continues to evolve rapidly in many instances due to factors that are out of our control in addition organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed rating processes on evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions unfavorable esg ratings could lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us our customers or our industry which could negatively impact our share price as well as our access to and cost of capital to the extent esg matters negatively impact our reputation it may also impede our ability to compete as effectively to recruit or retain employees which may adversely affect our operations 

although we may participate in various voluntary frameworks and certification programs or establish voluntary esg initiatives to improve the esg profile of our operations and product offerings we cannot guarantee that such efforts will have the intended results for example in december 2021 we announced a goal to use 100 renewable electricity across our global operations by 2030 our estimates concerning the timing and cost of implementing this and other goals are subject to risks and uncertainties some of which are outside of our control any failure or perceived failure to successfully achieve our voluntary goals or the manner in which we achieve some or any portion of our goals could adversely impact our reputation or to the extent related to sustainabilitylinked capital sources financial condition and results of operations our esg efforts may also include the adoption or expansion of certain esg practices or policies which may require us to expend additional resources to implement or to forego certain business opportunities to the extent others in our value chain do not meet pertinent requirements of such policies by contrast any failure or perceived failure to conform to such policies could have an adverse impact on our reputation and business activities our performance may be subject to greater scrutiny as a result of our announcement of any goals or policies and the publication of our performance against the same moreover despite the voluntary nature of such efforts we may receive pressure from external sources such as lenders investors or other groups to adopt more aggressive climate or other esgrelated initiatives however we may not agree that such initiatives will be appropriate for our business and we may not be able to implement such initiatives because of potential costs or technical or operational obstacles in addition we note that certain esg matters are becoming less “voluntary” as regulators including the sec begin proposing and adopting regulations regarding esg matters including but not limited to climate changerelated matters to the extent we are subject to increased regulatory requirements we could become subject to increased compliancerelated costs and risks including potential enforcement and litigation such esg matters may also impact our suppliers and customers which may compound or cause new impacts on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide and the elevated demand for talent from the growth in the demand for semiconductors following the onset of the covid19 pandemic has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel competition for engineering and other technical personnel in many areas of the world in which we operate is especially intense due to the proliferation of technology companies worldwide in addition current or future immigration laws policies or regulations may limit our ability to attract hire and retain qualified personnel if we are unable to attract onboard and retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate onboard and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our current and future needs our business and operations could be harmed 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation information systems management and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting and procurement functions to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations in addition many of these outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage employ cloud computing technology for such storage these providers’ cloud computing systems may be susceptible to “cyber incidents” such as intentional cyberattacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cybersecurity compromises which are outside of our control if we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if our thirdparty service providers pass on the cost of inflation to us or do not perform as anticipated or do not adequately protect our data from cyberrelated security breaches or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business 

processes we may experience operational difficulties such as limitations on our ability to ship products increased costs manufacturing or service interruptions or delays loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data quality and compliance issues and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on secure information technology for our business and are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and cyber incidents affecting our our customers ’  suppliers ’ and other service providers ’ systems and networks 

in the conduct of our business we collect use transmit and store data on information systems and networks including systems and networks owned and maintained by kla andor by thirdparty providers this data includes confidential information transactional information and intellectual property belonging to us our customers and our business partners as well as personally identifiable information of individuals despite network security and other measures our our customers’ suppliers’ and other thirdparty providers’ information systems and networks are susceptible to computer viruses ransomware cyberrelated security breaches and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions tampering misuse or criminal acts made directly against or through our thirdparty providers in the supply chain and against our systems and networks including phishing or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate including but not limited to vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in information systems networks software or hardware we have experienced cyberrelated attacks in the past and are likely to experience cyberrelated attacks in the future our security measures may also be breached due to employee errors malfeasance or otherwise third parties may also attempt to influence employees users suppliers or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our our customers’ or business partners’ data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to the information systems change frequently may not be recognized until launched against a target and are increasingly designed to circumvent controls avoid detection and remove or obfuscate forensic artifacts we may be unable to anticipate these techniques implement adequate preventative measures or adequately identify investigate and recover from cybersecurity incidents 

any cybersecurity incident or occurrence could impact our business directly or indirectly by impacting third parties in the supply chain in many potential ways disruptions to operations misappropriation corruption or theft of confidential information including intellectual property and other critical data of kla our customers or other business partners misappropriation of funds and company assets reduced value of our investments in research development and engineering litigation with or payment of damages to third parties reputational damage costs to comply with regulatory inquiries or actions data privacy issues costs to rebuild our information systems and networks and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs cybersecurity incidents affecting our customers could result in substantial delays in our ability to ship to those customers or install our products which could result in delays in revenue recognition or the cancellation of orders and cybersecurity incidents affecting our suppliers could result in substantial delays in our ability to obtain necessary components for our products from those suppliers which could hamper our ability to ship our products to our customers harming our results of operations 

we carry insurance that provides limited protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident but it will not likely cover all such losses and the losses it does not cover may be significant 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact our business operations 

our global operations are dependent upon certain information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications system failures or malfunctions such as difficulties with our customer relationship management system could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results our enterprise resource planning “erp” system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records record transactions provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems whether in connection with the regular operation periodic enhancements modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems or due to cybersecurity events such as ransomware attacks could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort in february 2019 we announced that we 

had consummated our acquisition of orbotech we may also enter into definitive agreements for and consummate acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates that we can close such acquisitions or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses if the costs associated with integrating the acquired business exceeds our expectations or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as well as businesses we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than anticipated in addition we may face other risks associated with acquisition transactions that may lead to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results including 

• we may have to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to acquired businesses 

• the combination of businesses may result in the loss of key personnel or an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our company andor the acquired business 

• we may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from our acquisitions 

• we may experience challenges in entering into new market segments for which we have not previously manufactured and sold products 

• we may face difficulties in coordinating geographically separated organizations systems and facilities 

• the customers distributors suppliers employees and others with whom the companies we acquire have business dealings may have a potentially adverse reaction to the acquisition 

• we may have difficulty implementing a cohesive framework of controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger usbased public company at companies that prior to acquisition may not have as robust controls procedures and policies particularly with respect to the effectiveness of cyber and information security practices and incident response plans compliance with data privacy and protection and other laws and regulations and compliance with usbased economic policies and sanctions which may not have previously been applicable to the acquired company’s operations 

• we may have to write off goodwill or other intangible assets and 

• we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions including but not limited to cybersecurity risks associated with integrating our networks or systems with those of acquired entities 

at times we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary highly sensitive information the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations or those of our suppliers or in the operations of our customers due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

we have significant manufacturing operations in the us singapore israel germany united kingdom italy and china in addition our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors and those of our suppliers as well as our other operations and those of our customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war such as russia’s invasion of ukraine terrorism health epidemics and pandemics fire earthquake volcanic eruptions energy shortages or power blackouts flooding or other natural disasters and certain of these events may become more frequent or intense as a result of climate change such disruption could cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers the ability of our suppliers to supply us components for our products in a timely manner or the timely installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites we cannot provide any assurance that alternate means of conducting our operations whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if such alternate means were available they could be obtained on favorable terms 

in addition as part of our costcutting actions we have consolidated several operating facilities our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above such as acts of war or terrorism earthquakes fires or other natural disasters if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at or acts of war in the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the industries we serve could adversely affect our business increased international political instability in various parts of the world disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations we maintain significant operations in israel since the establishment of the state of israel in 1948 a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility varying in degree and intensity has led to security and economic challenges for israel in addition some of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and may be called to active military duty in emergency circumstances we cannot assess the impact that emergency conditions in israel in the future may have on our business operations financial condition or results of operations but it could be material instability in any region could directly impact our ability to operate our business or our customers’ ability to operate their businesses cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate instability in the region could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we selfinsure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain risks are uninsurable are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance accordingly we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds the applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy for example we do not currently hold earthquake insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations a significant portion of which are conducted in california an area highly susceptible to earthquakes it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products much of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we selfinsure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also selfinsured either based on a similar costbenefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the japanese yen the euro the pound sterling and the israeli new shekel we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally in addition an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the us and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected furthermore if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge we may experience material financial losses 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments and an impairment of our investments could harm our earnings in addition we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that are susceptible to 

changes in market interest rates and bond yields as market interest rates and bond yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss an impairment of the fair market value of our investments even if unrealized must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

in addition the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets our operating results or other performance metrics or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies 

we are exposed to risks in connection with tax and regulatory compliance audits in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits such as related to customs or product safety requirements in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes penalties fines or other prohibitions against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that our products and practices comply with applicable regulations the final determination of any such audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals related to income taxes and other contingencies the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

we earn profits in and are therefore potentially subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions including singapore and israel the countries in which we earn the majority of our nonus profits due to economic political or other conditions tax rates in those jurisdictions may be subject to significant change a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in the tax rates imposed by those jurisdictions expiration of tax holidays in certain jurisdictions that are not renewed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development “iprd” and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in stockbased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of earnings from outside the us for which we have not previously provided for us taxes a change in our effective tax rate can materially and adversely impact our results from operations 

in addition recent changes to us tax laws will significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which was enacted into law on december 22 2017 however the recent us tax law changes are subject to future guidance from us federal and state governments such as the treasury department andor the internal revenue service any future guidance can change our tax liability a significant portion of the income taxes due to the enactment of the tax act is payable by us over a period of eight years as a result our cash flows from operating activities will be adversely impacted until the tax liability is paid in full numerous countries are evaluating their existing tax laws due in part to recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting project 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements has become increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices or changes in interpretations of such standards practices or rules can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting standards and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future changes to or revised interpretations or applications of existing accounting standards or tax rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business adoption of new standards may require changes to our processes accounting systems and internal controls difficulties encountered during adoption could result in internal control deficiencies or delay the reporting of our financial results 

risks associated with our industry 

ongoing changes in the technology industry as well as the semiconductor industry in particular could expose our business to significant risks 

the industries we serve including the semiconductor fpd and pcb industries are constantly developing and changing over time many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve pricing trends in the endmarkets for consumer electronics and other products which place a growing emphasis on our customers’ cost of ownership rising inflation in the supply chain and interest rates changes in our customers’ capital spending patterns and in general an environment of constant change and development including decreasing product and component dimensions use of new materials and increasingly complex device structures applications and process steps if we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends or with respect to technological advances if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry as a significant majority of our sales are our process control and yield management products sold to semiconductor manufacturers the trends our management monitors in operating our business include the following 

• the potential for reversal of the longterm historical trend of declining cost per transistor with each new generation of technological advancement within the semiconductor industry and the adverse impact that such reversal may have upon our business 

• the increasing cost of building and operating fabrication facilities and the impact of such increases on our customers’ capital equipment investment decisions 

• differing market growth rates and capital requirements for different applications such as memory and foundrylogic 

• lower level of process control adoption by our memory customers compared to our foundrylogic customers 

• our customers’ reuse of existing and installed products which may decrease their need to purchase new products or solutions at more advanced technology nodes 

• the emergence of disruptive technologies that change the prevailing semiconductor manufacturing processes or the economics associated with semiconductor manufacturing and as a result also impact the inspection and metrology requirements associated with such processes 

• the higher design costs for the most advanced ics which could economically constrain leadingedge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications 

• the possible introduction of integrated products by our larger competitors that offer inspection and metrology functionality in addition to managing other semiconductor manufacturing processes 

• changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes that are extremely costly for our customers to implement and accordingly our customers could reduce their available budgets for process control equipment by reducing inspection and metrology sampling rates for certain technologies 

• the bifurcation of the semiconductor manufacturing industry into a leading edge manufacturers driving continued rd into nextgeneration products and technologies and b other manufacturers that are content with existing including previous generation products and technologies 

• the ever escalating cost of nextgeneration product development which may result in joint development programs between us and our customers or government entities to help fund such programs that could restrict our control and ownership of and profitability from the products and technologies developed through those programs and 

• the entry by some semiconductor manufacturers into collaboration or sharing arrangements for capacity cost or risk with other manufacturers as well as increased outsourcing of their manufacturing activities and greater focus only on specific markets or applications whether in response to adverse market conditions or other market pressures 

any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers’ rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce which could result in downward pressure on our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been highly concentrated due to corporate consolidation acquisitions and business closures in this environment orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales this increasing concentration exposes our business financial condition and operating results to a number of risks including the following 

• the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year which exposes our business and operating results to increased volatility tied to individual customers 

• new orders from our foundrylogic customers in the past several years have constituted a significant portion of our total orders this concentration increases the impact that future business or technology changes within the foundrylogic industry may have on our business financial condition and operating results 

• in a highly concentrated business environment if a particular customer does not place an order or if they delay or cancel orders we may not be able to replace the business furthermore because our process control and yield management products are configured to each customer’s specifications any changes delays or cancellations of orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs 

• as a result of this consolidation the customers that survive the consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales and consequently have greater commercial negotiating leverage many of our large customers have more aggressive policies regarding engaging alternative secondsource suppliers for the products we offer and in addition may seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that may have an adverse impact on our business and we may not be able to pass on the cost of inflation to our customers any of these changes could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins 

• certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes created alliances with other companies experienced management changes or have outsourced manufacturing activities any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions any future change in ownership or management of our existing customers may result in similar challenges including the possibility of the successor entity or new management deciding to select a competitor’s products 

• the highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers for example as a result of the challenging economic environment during fiscal year 2009 we were and in some cases continue to be exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial viability of certain of our customers to the extent our customers experience liquidity issues in the future we may be required to incur additional credit losses with respect to receivables owed to us by those customers in addition customers with liquidity issues may be forced to reduce purchases of our equipment delay deliveries of our products discontinue operations or may be acquired by one of our customers and in either case such event would have the effect of further consolidating our customer base 

• semiconductor manufacturers generally must commit significant resources to qualify install and integrate process control and yield management equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s process control and yield management equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for that specific production line application and other similar production line applications if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment 

• prices differ among the products we offer for different applications due to differences in features offered or manufacturing costs if there is a shift in demand by our customers from our higherpriced to lowerpriced products our gross margin and revenues would decrease in addition when products are initially introduced they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation which can impact gross margin 

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we operate in industries that have historically been cyclical including the semiconductor industry the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the condition of the industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the industries in which we serve are difficult to predict the historically cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry in which we primarily operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization consumer demand for products inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in or cancellation or delay of orders which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customer’s funding status which could be weakened not only by rising interest rates adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or companyspecific reasons but also by funding limitations imposed by the customer’s unique organizational structure any of these factors could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results our business could be seriously harmed furthermore any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

the growth that we have experienced over the past few years has resulted in higher levels of backlog or remaining performance obligations “rpo” the supply chain disruptions caused by the ongoing pandemic as well as favorable market trends have led to customers agreeing to purchase equipment from us with lead times that are longer than our historical experience as the lead times for delivery of our equipment get longer the risk increases that customers may choose to change their equipment orders due to the evolution of the customers technological production or market needs this could result in order modifications rescheduling or even cancellations that may not be communicated to us in a timely manner causing rpo to remain elevated until agreed with the customer customer communication delays for orders already placed could affect our ability to respond quickly in weakening demand environments which could harm our results of operations 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the industries in which we serve including the semiconductor fpd and pcb industries depends in part on the continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips to the extent that driver slows semiconductor manufacturers may delay investments in equipment investigate more complex device architectures use new materials and develop innovative fabrication processes these and other evolving customer plans and needs require us to respond with continued development programs and cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards develop and introduce new products and solutions that successfully address changing customer needs win market acceptance of these new products and solutions and manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner our failure to accurately predict evolving industry standards and develop as well as offer competitive technology solutions in a timely manner with costeffective products could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

we must continue to make significant investments in rd in order to enhance the performance features and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands substantial rd costs 

typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

in addition the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks we regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer even before receiving the customer’s formal acceptance of that product in certain situations including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted however our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents all of which must perform to their respective specifications so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall product’s required specifications in such a situation the customer may be entitled to certain remedies which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and as a result our stock price 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of inspection products as a result any delay or reduction of sales of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results the continued customer demand for these products and the development introduction and market acceptance of new products and technologies are critical to our future success 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various us and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own which may adversely affect our business in addition we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product rd projects the termination of any such collaboration or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration could significantly impair our rd efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing we also try to control access to and distribution of our technology and proprietary information despite our efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or misappropriate our intellectual property or technology in addition former employees may seek employment with our customers suppliers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services we 

offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of continuing significant investments in product rd however we may enter new markets whether through acquisitions or new internal product development in which competition is based primarily on product pricing not technological superiority further some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials generally we do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing through our business interruption planning we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by among other things monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers certain key parts are available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers also key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers’ proprietary intellectual property in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for highperformance hightechnology components which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products in addition if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations which is a heightened risk especially during economic downturns it could affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products similarly especially with respect to suppliers of hightechnology components our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in a timely manner and result in delays for our products or our suppliers might pass on the cost of inflation to us while we are unable to adjust pricing with our own customers our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications or if we are able to do so only on unfavorable terms furthermore a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons including the supplier’s financial condition or business operational decisions which would require us to purchase in a single transaction a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers such “endoflife” parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory writeoff either of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods refer to the executive summary in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for additional information on supply constraints related to the covid19 pandemic 

if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan our operating results business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted 

we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually revised frequently generally quarterly and reviewed by management even more frequently at least monthly our business plan is developed based on a number of factors many of which require estimates and assumptions such as our expectations of the economic environment future business levels our customers’ willingness and ability to place orders leadtimes and future revenue and cash flow our budgeted operating expenses for example are based in part on our future revenue expectations however our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors including the volatile and historically cyclical nature of our primary industry customer order cancellations macroeconomic changes operational matters regarding particular agreements our ability to manage customer deliveries the availability of resources for the installation of our products delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a 

because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results similarly if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period which would also negatively affect our results of operations if we fail to operate our business consistent with 

our business plan our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted such an outcome could cause customers suppliers or investors to view us as less stable or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates any of which could have an adverse impact on our stock price 

in addition our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources the need to manage our operating model and other factors in furtherance of those efforts we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries installations and payment scheduling any such decisions may impact our ability to recognize revenue including the fiscal period during which such revenue may be recognized with respect to such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or stock price 

we have a leveraged capital structure 

as of june 30 2022 we had 673 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness consisting of 645 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes of which 300 billion were issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as of march 31 2022 we had in place a credit agreement the “prior credit agreement” providing for a 100 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the “prior revolving credit facility” with a maturity date of november 30 2023 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we replaced the prior credit agreement and prior revolving credit facility with a renegotiated credit agreement the “credit agreement” and a renegotiated unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” having a maturity date of june 8 2027 with two oneyear extension options that allows us to borrow up to 150 billion subject to the terms of the credit agreement the revolving credit facility may be increased by an amount up to 2500 million in the aggregate as of june 30 2022 we had an aggregate principal amount of 2750 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future by accessing the unfunded portion of our revolving credit facility andor entering into new financing arrangements we also announced a stock repurchase program under which the remaining available for repurchases was 323 billion as of june 30 2022 a large portion of the remaining repurchases may be financed with new indebtedness our ability to pay interest and repay the principal amount of our current indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations our credit rating the ongoing interest rate environment and the other risk factors discussed in this item 1a there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of our senior notes as defined below by at least two of moody’s investors service “moodys” sp global ratings “sp” and fitch inc “fitch” unless we have exercised our right to redeem the senior notes of such series we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or at the holder’s option any part of each holder’s senior notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below the “change of control offer” in the change of control offer we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of senior notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any on the senior notes repurchased up to but not including the date of repurchase we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time nor that we will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of that series of senior notes our ability to repurchase that series of senior notes in such event may be limited by law by the relevant indenture associated with that series of senior notes or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be a party at such time if we fail to repurchase that series of senior notes as required by the terms of such senior notes it would constitute an event of default under the relevant indenture governing that series of senior notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under our other obligations 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate and an increase in interest rates particularly in the current environment of rising interest rates would require us to pay additional interest on any borrowings which may have an adverse effect on the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline the interest rate under our revolving credit facility is also subject to i an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades and ii an adjustment based on our performance against certain sustainability key performance indicators “kpi” related to ghg emissions and renewable electricity usage additionally under our revolving credit facility we are required to comply with affirmative and negative covenants which include the maintenance of certain financial ratios the details of which can be found in note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

if we fail to comply with these covenants we will be in default and our borrowings may become immediately due and payable there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources nor that we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time in addition certain of our domestic subsidiaries are required to guarantee our borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the event we default on our borrowings these domestic subsidiaries shall be liable for our borrowings which could disrupt our operations and result in a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

our leveraged capital structure may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and net income per share 

our substantial amount of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to 

• a negative impact on our ability to satisfy our future obligations 

• an increase in the portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments that may not be available for operations working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments dividends stock repurchases general corporate or other purposes 

• an impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and 

• obligations to comply with restrictive and financial covenants as noted in the above risk factor and note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

our ability to satisfy our future expenses as well as our debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our future operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our future expenses and service our debt obligations which may impact our ability to manage our capital structure to preserve and maintain our investment grade rating if our future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows we may need to access the money available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility or enter into new financing arrangements to obtain necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms any borrowings under our revolving credit facility will place further pressure on us to comply with the financial covenants if we fail to make a payment associated with our debt obligations we could be in default on such debt and such a default could cause us to be in default on our other obligations 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us however future dividends may be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our rd legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws changes to our business model and our increased interest and principal payments required by our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions including our indemnification of third parties as well as the performance of our products 

although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties costly and timeconsuming litigation or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes or could impact our revenue or cost recognition any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in our commercial agreements from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers suppliers and lessors with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants thirdparty claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties or other claims made against certain parties we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes in addition notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations whether or not 

asserted due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects especially when products are first introduced unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us including increased service or warranty costs providing product replacements for or modifications to defective products litigation related to defective products reimbursement for damages caused by our products product recalls or product writeoffs or disposal costs these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business financial condition and operating results in addition our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

furthermore we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives such as credits toward future purchases we believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our longterm business as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase larger volumes of our products however these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives our volume purchase agreements require significant estimation for the amounts to be accrued depending upon the estimate of volume of future purchases as such we are required to update our estimates of the accruals on a periodic basis until the earnings process is complete our estimates could differ in comparison to actual results as a result these volume purchase arrangements while expected to be beneficial to our business over time could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in nearterm periods including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and therefore our gross margins 

in addition we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customerspecific commitments on pricing tool reliability spare parts stocking levels response time and other commitments and we may be unable to adjust pricing with our customers despite rising inflation in our supply chain furthermore we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection to date we have made no significant accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in supporting an audit or inspection or defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

there are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development 

we are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies both domestically and internationally governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion or a project may be terminated by mutual agreement if the parties determine that the project’s goals or milestones are not being achieved so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future in addition under the terms of these government grants the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur directly and indirectly in connection with such programs any such audit could result in modifications to or even termination of the applicable government funding program for example if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program those costs would not be reimbursed and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded we do not know the outcome of any future audits any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties financial or otherwise termination of funding programs suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency any of which could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations 

historically we have recorded material restructuring charges related to our prior global workforce reductions large excess inventory writeoffs and material impairment charges related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits 

of our restructuring plans or do so within the expected time frame if we again restructure our organization and business processes implement additional costreduction actions or discontinue certain business operations we may take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to among other things employee terminations or exit costs we may also be required to write off additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline also as our lead times from suppliers increase due to the increasing complexity of the parts and components they provide and the lead times demanded by our customers decrease due to the time pressures they face when introducing new products or technology or bringing new facilities into production we may be compelled to increase our commitments and therefore our risk exposure to inventory purchases to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner and that inventory may need to be written off if demand for the underlying product declines for any reason such additional writeoffs could result in material charges 

we have recorded material charges related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives based on economic benefit if known or using the straightline method and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for longlived assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including but not limited to declines in our operating cash flows declines in our stock price or market capitalization declines in our market share and declines in revenues or profits a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and as applicable the amount of any previous impairment charge could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge 

any such additional material charges whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements 

we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements 

we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions any of which may prove not to be financially viable if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables however by entering into these arrangements and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services we are exposed to additional risks if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered 

in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws if we were to violate any such law we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

executive summary 

we are a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions and services for the semiconductor and related electronics industries our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products and related service software and other offerings support rd and manufacturing of ics wafers and reticles our products services and expertise are used by our customers to measure detect analyze and resolve critical and nanometric level product defects helping them to manage manufacturing process challenges and to obtain higher finish product yields at lower cost we also offer advanced technology solutions to address various manufacturing needs of pcbs fpds specialty semiconductor devices and other electronic components including advanced packaging led power devices compound semiconductor and data storage industries as well as general materials research 

our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or both of the major semiconductor device manufacturing markets memory and foundrylogic the pervasive and increasing needs for semiconductors in many consumer and industrial products the rapid proliferation of new applications for more advanced semiconductor devices and the increasing complexity associated with leading edge semiconductor manufacturing drives demand for our process control and yield management solutions other demand trends include the growth of endmarket drivers such as ai the deployment of 5g telecommunications technology and associated highend mobile devices the electrification and digitalization of the automotive industry the revival of personal computer “pc” demand and associated innovations to support remote work virtual collaboration remote learning and entertainment and the growth of the iot the favorable end market dynamics are driving our customers to make increased investments in our process control and yield management solutions as part of their overall capital investment plans these trends also drive demand for our other products such as those used in the pcb fpd and specialty semiconductor manufacturing where the increase in technology complexity is expected to continue and further accelerate as more devices become interconnected and dependent on other electronic devices as a result of these factors we saw a general strengthening of demand for our products throughout fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022 while demand for our products remains strong the recent macroeconomic uncertainty and resulting impact on consumer demand is a development we are monitoring closely some of our customers particularly in the pc and mobile device end markets are experiencing market softening in the past few months and we have seen memory pricing in those markets weaken as well while our concerns are elevated we continue to see strong demand from our customers any push out or cancellation of deliveries by our customers could cause earnings volatility due to increases in risk of inventory related charges as well as the timing of revenue recognition 

we are organized into four reportable segments 

• semiconductor process control a comprehensive portfolio of inspection metrology and data analytics products as well as related service offerings that help ic manufacturers achieve target yields throughout the semiconductor fabrication process from rd to final volume production 

• specialty semiconductor process advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers 

• pcb display and component inspection a range of inspection testing and measurement and direct imaging for patterning products used by manufacturers of pcbs fpds advanced packaging mems and other electronic components 

• other products that do not fall into the three segments above 

a majority of our revenues are derived from outside the us and include geographic regions such as china taiwan korea japan europe and israel and rest of asia china is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ics additionally a significant portion of global fpd and pcb manufacturing has migrated to china government initiatives are propelling china to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting investment from semiconductor manufacturers from taiwan korea japan and the us although china is currently seen as an important longterm growth region for the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment sector commerce has added certain chinabased entities to the us entity list restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without a license in addition commerce has imposed new export licensing requirements on chinabased customers engaged in military end uses as well as requiring our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on us technology to manufacture products connected to huawei or its affiliates while these new rules have not significantly impacted our operations to date such actions by the us government or another country could impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers and adversely affect our business 

the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years 



 

1 our net income attributable to kla for the year ended june 30 2020 includes a pretax goodwill impairment charge of 2566 million and a pretax charge of 225 million as a result of the extinguishment of debt for additional details refer to note 7 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” and note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

impact of covid19 

events surrounding the ongoing covid19 pandemic had resulted in a reduction in economic activity across the globe in calendar year 2020 and early 2021 vaccinations and pandemic containment measures have now created an environment that is driving economic growth even as the pace of economic recovery remains uneven in various geographies on one hand the semiconductor and capital equipment industry has experienced multiple growth drivers including acceleration of the pace of virtual engagement and digitization driven by covid19 related travel restrictions and quarantines on the other hand the resumption of growth has caused us to experience new constraints in our supply chain supply chain lead times are extended and shortages have sometimes required us to plan further ahead and increase our purchase commitments to secure critical components on a timely basis we continue to monitor our supply chain and work with our suppliers to identify and mitigate potential gaps to ensure continuity of supply 

while all of our global manufacturing sites are currently operational any local pandemic outbreaks or advent of new variants have required and could in the future require us to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates or due to outbreaks affecting our manufacturing employees we remain committed to the health and safety of our employees contractors suppliers customers and communities and are following government policies and recommendations designed to slow the spread of covid19 

we are working with government authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate and continue to monitor our operations in an effort to ensure we follow government requirements relevant regulations industry standards and best practices to help safeguard our team members while safely continuing operations to the extent possible at our sites across the globe 

we may take further actions or alter our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and stakeholders or as required by federal state or local authorities 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following 

revenue recognition we primarily derive revenue from the sale of process control and processenabling solutions for the semiconductor and related electronics industries maintenance and support of all these products installation and training services and the sale of spare parts our portfolio includes yield enhancement and production solutions for manufacturing wafers and reticles ics packaging pcbs and fpds as well as comprehensive support and services across our installed base our solutions are generally not sold with a right of return nor have we experienced significant returns from or refunds to our customers 

we account for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties the rights of the parties are identified payment terms are identified the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable our revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties such as sales taxes the revenues are recognized as separate performance obligations that are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to the customer our arrangements with our customers include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations a product or service is considered distinct if it is separately identifiable from other deliverables in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer the transaction consideration including any sales incentives is allocated between separate performance obligations of an arrangement based on the standalone selling price “ssp” for each distinct product or service management considers a variety of factors to determine the ssp such as historical standalone sales of products and services discounting strategies and other observable data from time to time our contracts are modified to account for additional or to change existing performance obligations our contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively 

product revenue 

we recognize revenue from product sales at a point in time when we have satisfied our performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer we use judgment to evaluate whether control has transferred by considering several indicators including whether 

• we have a present right to payment 

• the customer has legal title 

• the customer has physical possession 

• the customer has significant risk and rewards of ownership and 

• the customer has accepted the product or whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of similar products for example when the customer has previously accepted the same tool with the same specifications and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria and when the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory 

not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer in circumstances in which revenue is recognized prior to the product acceptance the fair value of revenue associated with our performance obligations to install the product is deferred and recognized as revenue at a point in time once installation is complete 

we enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers we adjust the transaction consideration for estimated credits earned by our customers for such incentives these credits are estimated based upon the forecasted and actual product sales for any given period and agreedupon incentive rate the estimate is updated at each reporting period 

we offer perpetual and term licenses for software products the primary difference between perpetual and term licenses is the duration over which the customer can benefit from the use of the software while the functionality and the features of the software are the same software is generally bundled with postcontract customer support “pcs” which includes unspecified software updates that are made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement revenue from software licenses is recognized at a point in time when the software is made available to the customer revenue from pcs is deferred at contract inception and recognized ratably over the service period or as services are performed 

services revenue 

the majority of product sales include a standard six to 12month warranty that is not separately paid for by the customers the customers may also purchase extended warranties for periods beyond the initial year as part of the initial product sale we have concluded that the standard 12month warranty as well as any extended warranty periods included in the initial product sales are separate performance obligations for most of our products the estimated fair value of warranty services is deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the warranty period as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of warranty services provided by us 

additionally we offer product maintenance and support services which the customer may purchase separately from the standard and extended warranty offered as part of the initial product sale revenue from separately negotiated maintenance and support service contracts is also recognized over time based on the terms of the applicable service period revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract including training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed we also sell spare parts revenue from which is recognized when control over the spare parts is transferred to the customer 

significant judgments 

our contracts with our customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services each product and service is generally capable of being distinct within the context of the contract and represents a separate performance obligation determining the ssp for each distinct performance obligation and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements we typically estimate the ssp of products and services based on observable transactions when the products and services are sold on a standalone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable range we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of these products by customers and circumstances in these instances we use information such as the size of the customer geographic region as well as customization of the products in determining the ssp in instances where the ssp is not directly observable we determine the ssp using information that includes market conditions entityspecific factors including discounting strategies information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs while changes in the allocation of ssp between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular contract any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

although the products are generally not sold with a right of return we may provide other credits or sales incentives which are accounted for either as variable consideration or material right depending on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement these credits and incentives are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if and when additional information becomes available 

as outlined above we use judgments to evaluate whether or not the customer has obtained control of the product and consider several indicators in evaluating whether or not control has transferred to the customer not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer 

contract assetsliabilities 

the timing of revenue recognition billings and cash collections may result in accounts receivable contract assets and contract liabilities deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets a receivable is recorded in the period we deliver products or provide services when we have an unconditional right to payment contract assets primarily relate to the value of products and services transferred to the customer for which the right to payment is not just dependent on the passage of time contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when rights to payment become unconditional 

a contract liability is recognized when we receive payment or have an unconditional right to payment in advance of the satisfaction of performance the contract liabilities represent 1 deferred product revenue related to the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers and for which control has not been transferred to the customers and 2 deferred service revenue which is recorded when we receive consideration or such consideration is unconditionally due from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a contract deferred service revenue typically results from warranty services and maintenance and other service contracts 

contract assets and liabilities related to rights and obligations in a contract are recorded net in the consolidated balance sheets 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales customer contracts and acquired technologies expected costs to develop iprd into commercially viable products estimated cash flows from the projects when completed including assumptions associated with the technology migration curve estimated royalty rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets and discount rates the discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital “wacc” analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired including iprd based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which will not exceed one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill after the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 

the fair value of iprd is initially capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the iprd assets may not be recoverable impairment of iprd is recorded to rd expenses when an iprd project is completed the iprd is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized to costs of revenues over the asset’s estimated useful life 

acquisitionrelated expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or net realizable value net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value we review and set standard costs semiannually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

allowance for credit losses a majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor and electronics manufacturers throughout the world we maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable and assess collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues the estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts the allowance for credit losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance however volatility in market conditions and evolving credit trends are difficult to predict and may cause variability that may have a material impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods 

accounting for stockbased compensation plans compensation expense for rsus with performance metrics is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant or when a grant contains a market condition the grant date fair value using a monte carlo simulation the monte carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the award’s expected life the price volatility of the underlying stock as well as the potential outcomes of the market condition on the grant date of each award 

contingencies and litigation we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs incurred to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see note 16 “commitments and contingencies” and note 15 “litigation and other legal matters” to our consolidated financial statements for additional details 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets  impairment assessments we review goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable pursuant to the authoritative guidance we make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and allocate shared assets and liabilities to those reporting units which determines the carrying values for each reporting unit when assessing goodwill for impairment an initial assessment of qualitative factors determines whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value judgments related to qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance relevant entityspecific events a sustained decrease in share price and other events affecting the reporting units if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value a 

quantitative test is then performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value including goodwill if the former is lower goodwill is written down by the excess amount limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit see note 7 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the market approach when deemed appropriate and the necessary information is available or the income approach which uses discounted cash flow “dcf” analysis or a combination of both if multiple valuation methodologies are used the results are weighted determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about appropriate discount rates revenue growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows discount rates are based on a wacc which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity plus a risk premium the wacc used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts the market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies 

we review purchased finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of the assets are shorter than initially expected we determine whether finitelived intangible assets are recoverable based on the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowestlevel associated asset grouping assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective if the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the longlived assets’ carrying value we recognize an impairment loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable the authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill it allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset the qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is morelikelythannot that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value our indefinitelived intangible assets are iprd intangible assets 

any impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and net asset value in the quarter in which we recognize the impairment charge see note 7 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires income tax effects for changes in tax laws to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in 

tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activities any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

we record income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us our effective tax rate would be adversely affected if we change our intent or if such undistributed earnings are needed for us operations because we would be required to provide or pay income taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings 

global intangible lowtaxed income the tax act includes provisions for global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” wherein us taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations this income is effectively taxed at a 105 tax rate in general we elect to account for gilti as a component of current period tax expense and not recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the basis differences expected to reverse as a result of gilti provisions

results of operations 

revenues and gross margin 

product revenues 

our business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles in the preceding period revenue is also impacted by average customer pricing customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

the increase in product revenues by 39 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily attributable to strong demand for many of our products especially our inspection metrology and specialty semiconductor process portfolios as customers prioritize technology development investments and also expand their capacity to meet resilient semiconductor end customer demand 

service revenues 

service revenues are generated from product maintenance and support services as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers the amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems but it is also impacted by other factors such as our rate of service contract renewals the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

the increase in service revenues by 14 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to an increase in our installed base 

revenues by segment 1 

 

1 segment revenues exclude corporate allocations and the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for additional details refer to note 19 “segment reporting and geographic information” to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue from our semiconductor process control segment increased by 38 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to a strong demand for many of our products especially from our inspection and metrology portfolios the increase in revenues from our specialty semiconductor process segment which comprises etching and deposition solutions for advanced packaging and specialty semiconductor markets is primarily driven by advances in the ic packaging technology roadmap and growth in demand for automotive power rf filters and mems devices the revenue from our pcb display and component inspection segment was relatively flat in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 

revenues  top customers 

the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues primarily in our semiconductor process control segment for the indicated periods 

revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows 

a significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that trend to continue 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions 

the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin 

changes in gross margin which are driven by the revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues changes in gross margin from the mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes within the composition of product and service offerings and amortization of inventory fair value adjustments from business combinations changes in gross margin from manufacturing labor overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements and amortization of intangible assets changes in gross margin from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk 

the increase in our gross margin from 599 to 610 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 is primarily attributable to a higher revenue volume of products and services sold and a more profitable mix of products and services sold partially offset by an increase in service and manufacturing costs 

segment gross profit 1 

 

1 segment gross profit is calculated as segment revenues less segment costs of revenues and excludes corporate allocations the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates amortization of intangible assets inventory fair value adjustments and acquisitionrelated costs for additional details refer to note 19 “segment reporting and geographic information” to our consolidated financial statements 

the primary factors impacting the performance of our segment gross profits for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 are summarized as follows 

• semiconductor process control segment gross profit increased due to a more profitable mix of products and services sold partially offset by an increase in service and manufacturing costs 

• the segment gross profits of the specialty semiconductor process segment increased primarily due to a more favorable mix of products and services sold as well as a higher revenue volume 

• the segment gross profits of the pcb display and component inspection and other segments decreased primarily due to a less favorable mix of products and services sold as well as an increase in other service and manufacturing costs 

research and development 



rd expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our rd efforts as technological innovation is essential to our success we may incur significant costs associated with rd projects including compensation for engineering talent engineering material costs and other expenses 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 1494 million as a result of additional engineering headcount higher employee benefit costs and higher variable compensation higher consulting costs of 95 million and an iprd writeoff of 60 million 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our rd we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies 

selling general and administrative 

sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 primarily due to increases in the following employeerelated expenses of 557 million as the result of additional headcount higher employee benefit costs and variable compensation depreciation expense of 242 million consulting costs of 157 million facility and office expenses of 112 million travel expenses of 64 million and external sales commissions and trade shows of 61 million 

goodwill impairment 

we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of february 28 2022 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 as a result of our annual goodwill impairment testing for all reporting units we recorded 1442 million and 1125 million in impairment charges in the specialty semiconductor process and pcb and display reporting units respectively in the three months ended march 31 2020 

restructuring charges 

over the last few years management approved plans to streamline our organization and business processes which included reductions of workforce 

restructuring charges were  10 million for the year ended june 30 2022 restructuring charges were  124 million for the year ended june 30 2021 and included  39 million of noncash charges for accelerated depreciation related to certain rightofuse “rou” assets and fixed assets to be abandoned restructuring charges were 77 million for the year ended june 30 2020 

for additional information refer to note 20 “restructuring charges” to our consolidated financial statements 

interest expense and other expense income net 



the increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 was primarily due to higher interest expense on our revolving credit facility which is described further in the “liquidity and capital resources” section below 

other expense income net is comprised primarily of fair value adjustments and realized gains or losses on sales of marketable and nonmarketable securities gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts interestrelated accruals such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations and interest income earned on our invested cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

the increase in other expense income net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 was primarily due to a fair value loss of 189 million from an equity security in the current fiscal year following initial fair value gains of 267 million when it became marketable in the prior fiscal year as well as a 44 million gain recorded in the prior fiscal year due to the sale of our interest in pixcell medical technologies ltd these were partially offset by a gain from the sale of an investment of 277 million in fiscal year 2022 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 loss on extinguishment of debt reflected a pretax net loss of 225 million associated with the redemption of our 5000 million of senior notes due 2021 including associated redemption premiums accrued interest and other fees and expenses 

provision for income taxes 

the following table provides details of income taxes 



tax expense was lower as a percentage of income before taxes during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 primarily due to the impact of the following items 

• tax expense decreased by 3927 million relating to a nonrecurring tax benefit resulting from the intraentity transfers of certain intellectual property rights during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 

• tax expense decreased by 293 million relating to the impact of an increase in the proportion of klas earnings generated in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us statutory rate during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 partially offset by 

• tax expense increased by 934 million relating to an increase in our unrecognized tax benefit during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 and 

• tax expense increased by 212 million relating to a nondeductible decrease in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan “edsp” during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income the amount of our pretax income as business activities fluctuate nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions rd credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income nontaxable or nondeductible increases 

or decreases in the assets held within our edsp the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies

liquidity and capital resources 



cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

as of june 30 2022 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 271 billion which represents an increase of 2135 million from june 30 2021 the increase is mainly due to net cash provided by operating activities of 331 billion and net proceeds from issuance of debt including net draws on our prior revolving credit facility and our revolving credit facility of 322 billion partially offset by stock repurchases of 397 billion cash paid for purchase of forward contract for accelerated share repurchases of 9000 million cash used for payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of 6385 million cash paid for business acquisitions of 4791 million capital expenditures of 3073 million and net cash usage of 1185 million related to the purchases sales and maturities of availableforsale and trading securities

stock repurchases 

the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 and 2021 our stock repurchase program is intended in part to mitigate the potential dilutive impact related to our equity incentive plans and shares issued in connection with our espp as well as to return excess cash to our stockholders as of march 31 2022 an aggregate of 070 billion was available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program in june 2022 the board of directors authorized an additional 600 billion for share repurchases on june 23 2022 the company executed asr agreements with two financial institutions to repurchase shares of our common stock in exchange for an upfront payment of 300 billion the company received initial deliveries totaling approximately 65 million shares on june 24 2022 which represented 70 of the prepayment amount at the then prevailing market price of the companys shares of stock the initial shares delivered were retired immediately upon settlement and treated as repurchases of the companys common stock for purposes of earnings per share calculations the value of the shares yet to be delivered to the company for the remainder of the upfront payment of approximately 090 billion was recorded as an unsettled forward contract classified within stockholders’ equity the delivery of any remaining shares would occur at the final settlement of the transactions under the asr agreements which is scheduled for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 subject to earlier termination under certain limited circumstances as set forth in the asr agreements the total number of shares received under the asr agreements will be based on the volumeweighted average prices of the companys stock during the term of the asr agreements less an agreedupon discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the asr agreements 

cash flows provided by operating activities 

we have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 increased by 113 billion compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 from 219 billion to 331 billion primarily as a result of the following factors 

• an increase in collections of approximately 26 billion mainly driven by higher shipments during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 and 

• an increase in gains from currency and interest rate derivatives used for risk management purposes of approximately 99 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 partially offset by the following items

in february 2020 sp upgraded its credit rating of the company to “bbb” and revised its outlook to stable which permanently eliminated interest rate adjustments and the interest rate on the 2014 senior notes became fixed the interest rates for each series of the 2020 senior notes and 2019 senior notes are not subject to creditratingbased rate adjustments 

since fiscal 2015 we have entered into four sets of forward contracts to lock the benchmark interest rate on portions of our senior notes prior to issuance “ rate lock agreements” upon issuance of the associated debt the rate lock agreements were settled and their fair values were recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income loss the resulting gains and losses from these transactions are amortized to interest expense over the lives of the associated debt for additional details on the forward contracts refer to note 17 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to our consolidated financial statements 

the original discounts on the 2022 senior notes the 2020 senior notes the 2019 senior notes and the 2014 senior notes amounted to 128 million 03 million 67 million and 40 million respectively and are being amortized over the life of the debt interest is payable as follows semiannually on january 15 and july 15 of each year for the 2022 senior notes semiannually on march 1 and september 1 of each year for the 2020 senior notes semiannually on march 15 and september 15 of each year for the 2019 senior notes and semiannually on may 1 and november 1 of each year for the 2014 senior notes the relevant indentures for the senior notes collectively the “indenture” include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of senior notes by at least two of moody’s sp and fitch unless we have exercised our rights to redeem the senior notes of such series we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or at the holder’s option any part of each holder’s senior notes of that series pursuant to the change of control offer in the change of control offer we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of senior notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any on the senior notes repurchased up to but not including the date of repurchase 

as of june 30 2022 we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the indenture associated with the senior notes 

revolving credit facility 

as of march 31 2022 we had in place the prior credit agreement providing for a 100 billion fiveyear unsecured prior revolving credit facility with a maturity date of november 30 2023 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we replaced the prior credit agreement and prior revolving credit facility with the credit agreement and the revolving credit facility having a maturity of june 8 2027 that allows us to borrow up to 150 billion subject to the terms of the credit agreement the revolving credit facility may be increased by an amount up to 2500 million in the aggregate as of june 30 2021 we had no aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the prior revolving credit facility during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 we borrowed 6000 million from the prior revolving credit facility and made principal payments of 6000 million as of june 30 2022 we had an aggregate principal amount of 2750 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility which was borrowed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022

in june 2022 sp upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from bbb to a in march 2022 fitch upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from bbb to a in june 2021 moodys upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from baa1 to a2 factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries our financial position material acquisitions and changes in our business strategy 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of june 30 2022 actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2022 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 101 billion these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of june 30 2022 the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by 94 million 

the fair market value of longterm fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as market interest rates fall and decrease as market interest rates rise as of june 30 2022 the fair value and the book value of our senior notes due in various fiscal years ranging from 2025 to 2063 were 639 billion and 645 billion respectively since february 2020 the interest rates on our senior notes have not been subject to creditrating based rate adjustments 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we replaced the prior credit agreement and prior revolving credit facility with a renegotiated credit agreement and renegotiated unsecured revolving credit facility subject to the terms of credit agreement the revolving credit facility allows us to borrow up to 150 billion has a maturity date of june 8 2027 with two oneyear extension options and may be increased by an amount up to 2500 million in the aggregate as of june 30 2022 we had an aggregate principal amount of 2750 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility each term sofr loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable adjusted term sofr rate which is equal to the applicable term sofr rate plus 10 bps that shall not be less than zero plus a spread ranging from 75 bps to 125 bps as determined by the companys credit ratings at the time the fair value of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility is subject to interest rate and credit risk due to the timing of the rate resets and changes in the markets assessment of risk of default respectively pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement we are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility at a rate that ranges from 45 bps to 125 bps depending upon the companys then prevailing credit rating as of june 30 2022 the annual commitment fee was 9 bps at june 30 2022 if our credit ratings were downgraded to be below investment grade the maximum potential increase to our annual commitment fee for the revolving credit facility using the highest range of the ranges discussed above is estimated to be approximately 1 million 

our equity investment in a publicly traded company is subject to market price risk which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities as of june 30 2022 the fair value of our investment in the marketable equity security which began publicly trading on the tokyo stock exchange on april 5 2021 was 110 million assuming a decline of 50 in market prices the aggregate value of our investment in the marketable equity security could decrease by approximately 6 million based on the value as of june 30 2022 

see note 5 “marketable securities” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “liquidity and capital resources” in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 and risk factors in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of june 30 2022 

as of june 30 2022 we had net forward and option contracts to purchase 582 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures see note 17 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to our consolidated financial statements for additional details if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2022 the us dollar equivalent would have been 642 million a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 942 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our results of operations or cash flows

industry 

general background 

kla’s core focus is enabling technological advances as well as improving manufacturing yields in the semiconductor industry the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is typically 200 millimeters 

or 300 millimeters in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is highly sophisticated and involves the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish other more specialized wafers such as epitaxial silicon “epi” silicon on insulator “soi” gallium nitride “gan” and silicon carbide “sic” are also common in the semiconductor industry 

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a semiconductor chipor “semiconductor” is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times the majority of chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions and the upper “interconnect” structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality the wafer is then cut into individual chips and the chips that pass functional testing are packaged final testing is performed on all packaged chips packaged chips are then mounted onto pcbs for connection to the rest of the electronic system additionally fpds are manufactured using processes similar to ics eg film deposition photolithography etching except using glass as the starting substrate 

the semiconductor capital equipment industry is currently experiencing multiple growth drivers bolstered by demand for semiconductors from leading edge foundry and logic manufacturers to support computational power and connectivity for markets such as artificial intelligence “ai” and 5g wireless technology growth of virtual engagement has been driven by covid19 related travel restrictions and quarantines as well as work from home requirements and advances in healthcare and industrial applications these factors together with the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and intelligence in automobiles are powering leadingedge node technology investments and capacity expansions intertwined in these areas spurred by the requirements of big data is the growth in demand for memory chips finally china continues to emerge as a major region for the manufacturing of logic and memory chips adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ics government initiatives are propelling china to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity china is currently seen as an important longterm growth region for the semiconductor capital equipment sector 

the semiconductor industry continually introduces numerous technology changes to support this multisegmented market growth kla’s inspection metrology and data analytics technologies play key roles in enabling our customers to develop and manufacture advanced semiconductor devices to support and innovate around these trends 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and advancing new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to highvolume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies some requiring new substrate and film materials new geometries advanced multipatterning optical and extreme ultraviolet “euv” lithography and advanced packaging techniques while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of semiconductor manufacturing significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected the adoption of these technologies into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects device performance characteristics namely speed capacity or power management also become more sensitive to parameters such as linewidth and film thickness variation new process materials such as photoresists for euv lithography require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face 

the continuing evolution of semiconductors to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost well above 10 billion substantially more than previousgeneration facilities in addition chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment 

by developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption and production of these new technologies at scale kla enables customers to better leverage increasingly expensive facilities and improve roi once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume kla’s systems monitor to ensure yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution in addition each new generation’s smaller design rules coupled with new materials device innovation and increased inprocess variability require a subsequent increase in inspection and metrology sampling which drives demand for kla’s portfolio of products 

kla systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer reticle and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so they can identify and address the underlying process issues the ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables kla customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes increasing their yield of highperformance parts and delivering products to market faster thus maximizing profits with a broad portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and dedicated yield technology expertise kla is a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ nextgeneration products kla helps customers anticipate and respond to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architectures more demanding lithography processes and new packaging techniques

pcb and display manufacturing 

printed circuit board manufacturing 

pcbs are the basic interconnect platforms for the electronic components that comprise all electronic equipment an assembly of one or more pcbs on which desired components have been mounted forms an essential part of most electronic products pcbs are manufactured in a series of complex steps generally starting with a sheet of epoxyfiberglass or other material with electric insulating qualities laminated with a conducting material such as copper the conductor pattern is subsequently transferred to a photoimageable layer which is coated over the conductive layer substrate either through a di or masked based photolithographic process followed by a chemical development and etching removal process of excess conducting material leaving the desired conducting metal pattern printed on the layer 

because of the complexity of each step in the process of pcb manufacturing sophisticated equipment is required in order to enable manufacturing especially of high complexity boards where high accuracy is required dimensions of pcb boards change during the manufacturing process and digital printing is required in order to compensate for these changes and meet demand for high accuracy pcbs are susceptible to various defects electrical shorts open circuits and insufficient or offmeasure conductor widths inspection is required throughout pcb production to identify such defects which are then repaired if possible early detection of these defects increases the possibility of successful repair and reduces the number of unusable boards thereby reducing the overall cost to the manufacturer early detection and repair are particularly valuable in cases of multilayered and “buildup” boards wherein pcb layers are embedded inside the finished board 

the orbotech pcb businesses offer several solutions intended for use by manufacturers of pcbs to streamline and increase the efficiency and yield of pcb production including the integrated preproduction software solutions that automate the entire process from quotation to the production floor

in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of subsidiaries or branches in other countries including china germany israel united kingdom japan singapore korea and taiwan international revenues accounted for approximately 89 89 and 87 of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended june 30 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 19 “segment reporting and geographic information” to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in nonus dollar product sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in item 1a “risk factors” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our backlog which represents our performance obligation to deliver products and services totaled 469 billion and 213 billion as of june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received and a majority of the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months orders for service contracts and unreleased products are included in the backlog all orders are subject to risk of delays pushouts and cancellation by the customer usually with limited or no penalties 

because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods the historical cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between on the one hand our ability to manufacture deliver and install products and on the other the requirements of our customers in our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources management of our operating model and other factors we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries and installations of products which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products 

research and development 

the market for semiconductor and electronics industries is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we make significant investments in product rd for the timely development of new products and enhancements necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to rd programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs in addition we may enter certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby certain government agencies or other third parties fund a portion of our rd costs 

our key rd activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 involved the development of process control and processenabling solutions for a broad range of industries including semiconductors pcbs and displays for information regarding our rd expenses during the last three fiscal years see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product rd even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to enhance our competitive position new product introductions however may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products and if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in the united states singapore israel germany united kingdom italy and china 

some critical parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications while other parts are standard commercial products we use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers through our business interruption planning we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by among other things monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources or disruptions within our suppliers’ often complex supply chains could disrupt scheduled 

deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for technologically advanced process control processenabling and yield management solutions used by semiconductor and electronics manufacturers is highly competitive in each of our product markets we have many competitors including companies such as applied materials inc asml holding nv hitachi hightechnologies corporation onto innovation inc and lasertec inc some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product rd 

we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated capabilities into their existing development and manufacturing processes to enhance productivity improve yields and reduce waste significant competitive factors in the market for process control and processenabling systems include system performance ease of use reliability interoperability with the existing installed base and technical service and support as well as overall cost of ownership 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with our industryleading portfolio of products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenue gross margin and market share should this occur it could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business no single patent copyright or trade secret is essential to us as a whole or to any of our business segments 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

government regulations 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local governmental laws and regulations worldwide including laws and regulations related to anticorruption antitrust data privacy employment environmental foreign exchange controls health and safety immigration importexport intellectual property and tax compliance with these laws and regulations did not have in fiscal 2021 and is not expected to have in fiscal 2022 a material effect on our capital expenditures financial condition results of operations or competitive position 

however any failure to comply with laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate in the case of environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials our failure to comply with laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities 

human capital management 

our employees are our greatest asset and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace in order to compete and succeed in highly competitive markets and industries that are subject to rapid technological change we believe it is critical to attract motivate and retain a dedicated talented and innovative team of employees who exhibit our core values 

our core values 

at kla our core values – demonstrating perseverance striving to be better being honest forthright and consistent building highperforming teams and being indispensable to our customers – serve as a foundation for our relationships with employees customers suppliers and other stakeholders and reflect a commitment to ethical business practices and corporate citizenship in the places where we do business 

our workforce 

as of june 30 2021 we had approximately 11300 regular fulltime employees and approximately 250 parttime and temporary employees in facilities located in 19 countries approximately 30 of our regular fulltime employees are located in the united states 23 in europe and middle eastern countries and 47 in asia pacific and japan with approximately 19 engaged in manufacturing 27 in rd 31 in customer service 4 in sales and marketing and 19 in other roles except for our employees in belgium where a trade union delegation has been recognized and our employees in the german operations of our mie business unit who are represented by employee works council none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

in fiscal year 2021 our overall turnover rate was 56 

compensation and benefits 

we seek to achieve our objective of attracting retaining and motivating our workforce by linking a significant portion of compensation to company and business unit performance we enable employees to share in the success of the company through various programs including an employee stock purchase plan “espp” equity compensation profit sharing and bonus plans we seek competitiveness and fairness in total compensation with reference to peer comparisons and internal equity in addition to providing our employees with competitive compensation packages we offer benefits designed to meet the needs of employees and their families including paid time off parental leave bereavement leave health insurance coverage flexible work arrangements contributions to retirement savings and access to employee assistance and worklife programs 

inclusion and diversity 

we believe in fostering a diverse workforce and an equitable and inclusive culture in order to build a stronger and more resilient company for our customers our employees and our communities we have established programs for recruiting and hiring candidates from diverse backgrounds and experiences we have conducted audits in the united states and israel on gender pay equity that have shown no significant pay equity exist in the employee populations tested we are an equal opportunityaffirmative action employer and have increased our efforts to recruit develop and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field including women black and hispanic candidates in fiscal year 2021 we created the role of chief inclusion  diversity officer to provide additional focus to this area 

we have promoted several employee resource groups to further our diversity initiatives these include a women’s group as well as groups based on race and ethnicity such as the black and hispanic resource groups 

we have a tradition of amplifying the charitable actions of our employees and responding to the needs of the communities where we work in 2020 in order to show support for effecting positive change in society we joined countless others to donate to organizations fighting for social justice and racial equality 

as of june 30 2021 our global workforce was 82 male and 18 female and 8 of our workforce in the united states was composed of black or african american and hispanic or latino employees

many of our employees are required to take annual training courses and regular certifications related to their work including those pertaining to the environment data privacy and workplace health and safety we also have leadership development programs available to employees including the new manager training program corporate values training program and executive leadership programs 

employee engagement 

we conduct regular employee surveys to check in with our global workforce and obtain input on a number of topics the feedback we receive from these surveys helps us assess employee sentiment identify areas of improvement and guides our decisionmaking as it relates to people management in addition our executives conduct regular weekly and quarterly webcasts these global webcasts enable all employees to engage with senior leaders and ask questions in an open qa session 

health and safety and pandemic response 

kla is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all employees we accomplish this through strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety including recognition and control of workplace hazards tracking injury and illness rates utilizing a global travel health program and maintaining detailed emergency and disaster recovery plans 

kla’s top priority during the ongoing covid19 pandemic has been and continues to be protecting the health and safety of our employees and their families our customers and our community the commitment to this effort is evidenced by the extensive planning and numerous actions kla swiftly took to respond to the pandemic including the development and implementation of an infectious disease playbook a work from home program health check protocols screenings for all employees working on site new process workflows at physical sites to ensure reduced contact for employees working on site contact tracing processes and protocols quarantining and testing protocols for exposure and positive tests onsite vaccination clinics and travel guidelines and protocols to ensure employees who must travel for work can do so safely and phased returntowork plans and approval processes to enable nonmanufacturing employees to returntowork when permitted by local government regulations kla continues to maintain workplace flexibility such as working remotely where possible to reduce the number of people who are on site each day in april 2020 kla launched a worldwide survey of its people to better understand how remote workers were doing during the pandemic the results of this survey have informed our continued response to the covid19 pandemic and were shared with all of our employees

for a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business see below 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the current covid19 pandemic and the potential aftereffects from it could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations  

the covid19 pandemic has caused substantial global disruptions including in the jurisdictions where we conduct business and may cause additional disruptions in the future which are impossible to predict local regional and national authorities in numerous jurisdictions have implemented a variety of measures designed to slow the spread of the virus including social distancing guidelines quarantines banning of nonessential travel and requiring the cessation of nonessential activities on the premises of businesses while all of our global sites are currently operational any local pandemic outbreaks could require us to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates 

covid19 vaccines have been approved and become available for use in the united states and certain other countries however given our global operations we are unable to predict how widely utilized the vaccines ultimately will be and whether they will be effective in preventing the spread of covid19 including its variant strains in addition although economic activity has begun to improve in recent months from the global reduction in economic activity in calendar year 2020 caused by the covid19 pandemic the pace of economic recovery remains uneven in various geographies and the resumption of growth has caused us to experience new constraints in our supply chain as discussed below 

some of the risks associated with the pandemic or a worsening of the pandemic in the future include 

• cancellation or reduction of routes available from common carriers which may cause delays in our ability to deliver or service our products or receive components from suppliers necessary to manufacture or service our products 

• shortages or disruption in the supply chain could affect our ability to procure components for our products on a timely basis or at all or could require us to commit to increased purchases and provide longer lead times to secure critical components which could increase inventory obsolescence risk refer to the executive summary in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for additional information on supply constraints related to the covid19 pandemic 

• travel bans or the requirement to quarantine for a lengthy period after entering a jurisdiction which may delay our ability to install the products we sell or service those products following installation 

• governmental orders or employee exposure requiring us our customers or our suppliers to discontinue manufacturing products at our respective facilities for a period of time 

• reduced demand for our products delivery pushouts or cancellation of orders by our customers caused by a global recession resulting from the pandemic and the measures implemented by authorities to slow the spread of covid19 

• increased costs or inability to acquire components necessary for the manufacture of our products due to reduced availability 

• absence of liquidity at customers and suppliers caused by disruptions from the pandemic which may hamper the ability of customers to pay for the products they purchase on time or at all or hamper the ability of our suppliers to continue to supply components to us in a timely manner or at all and 

• loss of efficiencies due to remote working requirements for our employees 

if any of the foregoing risks occur or intensify during this pandemic our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

commercial operational financial and regulatory risks 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges including but not limited to 

• global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses trade sanctions tariffs and international trade disputes 

• political and social attitudes laws rules regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over nondomestic companies including customer or governmentsupported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors 

• ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries 

• managing cultural diversity and organizational alignment 

• exposure to the unique characteristics of each region in the global market which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period 

• periodic local or international economic downturns 

• potential adverse tax consequences including withholding tax rules that may limit the repatriation of our earnings and higher effective income tax rates in foreign countries where we do business 

• compliance with customs regulations in the countries in which we do business 

• existing and potentially new tariffs or other trade restrictions and barriers including those applied to our products spare parts and services or to parts and supplies that we purchase 

• political instability natural disasters legal or regulatory changes acts of war or terrorism in regions where we have operations or where we do business 

• fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may adversely impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business although we attempt to manage some of our nearterm currency risks through the use of hedging instruments there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate 

• our ability to receive prepayments for certain of our products and services sold in certain jurisdictions these prepayments increase our cash flows for the quarter in which they are received if our practice of requiring prepayments in those jurisdictions changes or deteriorates our cash flows would be harmed 

• longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable outside of the united states 

• difficulties in managing foreign distributors including monitoring and ensuring our distributors’ compliance with applicable laws and 

• inadequate protection or enforcement of our intellectual property and other legal rights in foreign jurisdictions 

in addition government controls either by the united states or other countries that restrict our business overseas or restrict our ability to import or export our products and services or increase the cost of our operations through the imposition of tariffs new controls outright bans or otherwise could harm our business for example commerce has added numerous chinabased entities to the us entity list including fujian jinhua integrated circuit company ltd huawei and semiconductor manufacturing international corporation restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without an export license even if we apply for licenses to sell our products or provide services to companies on commerce’s us entity list there can be no assurance that licenses will be granted in addition commerce has imposed new export licensing requirements on chinabased customers engaged in military end uses or where commerce has determined there is a risk of diversion to a military end use as well as requiring our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on us technology to manufacture products connected to huawei or its affiliates to date these new rules have not significantly impacted our operations but we are continually monitoring their impact if additional companies are added to commerce’s us entity list or other licensing requirements or restrictions are imposed thereby limiting our ability to sell our products or services to other customers in china our business could be significantly harmed similar actions by the us government or another country could impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers 

any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy 

demand for our products is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending and can cause our customers to decrease cancel or delay their equipment and service orders the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit can make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell reduced demand combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of such financing has at times in the past adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels 

in addition a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and where applicable credit ratings of such investments a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity if the market value of such investments were to decline or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

we might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property or other confidential information that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the industries in which we serve from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information in addition we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties with respect to intellectual property infringement disputes our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however there can be no assurance that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition furthermore we may potentially be subject to claims by customers suppliers or other business partners or by governmental law enforcement agencies related to our receipt distribution andor use of thirdparty intellectual property or confidential information legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit and associated internal investigations with respect to intellectual property or confidential information disputes are often expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert management’s attention and other company resources andor may result in restrictions on our ability to sell our products settlements on significantly adverse terms or adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines any of which could have a significant negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings claims or investigations the instigation of legal proceedings or claims our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims or the determination of any adverse findings against us or any of our employees in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our business reputation 

we are exposed to various risks related to the legal regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to compliance with laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust anticorruptionantibribery unclaimed property economic sanctions and export control regulations we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable law but there can be no assurance our policies and procedures will prove completely effective in ensuring compliance by all our personnel as well as our business partners and representatives for whose misconduct we may under some circumstances be legally responsible our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in government investigations andor enforcement actions which could result in significant financial cost including investigation expenses defense costs assessments and criminal or civil penalties reputational harm and other consequences that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business from time to time we may receive inquiries subpoenas investigative demands or audit notices from governmental or regulatory bodies or we may make voluntary disclosures related to legal regulatory or tax compliance matters and these matters may result in significant financial cost including investigation expenses defense costs assessments and criminal or civil penalties reputational harm and other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be subject to new or amended laws including laws that conflict with other applicable laws which may impose compliance challenges and create the risk of noncompliance 

our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations including those that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental regulations including regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute potentially more expensive andor rarer materials further we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by any release regardless of fault we also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the materials composition of our products including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources of certain metals and other materials the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business 

in addition we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment immigration contracts product performance product liability antitrust environmental regulations securities unfair competition and other matters these legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit our ability to sell our products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims which could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel competition for engineering and other technical personnel in many areas of the world in which we operate is especially intense due to the proliferation of technology companies worldwide in addition current or future immigration laws policies or regulations may limit our ability to attract hire and retain qualified personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel or if we are unable to attract assimilate and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our current and future needs our business and operations could be harmed 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation information systems management and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting and procurement functions to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the 

services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations in addition many of these outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage employ cloud computing technology for such storage these providers’ cloud computing systems may be susceptible to “cyber incidents” such as intentional cyberattacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cybersecurity compromises which are outside of our control if we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as anticipated or do not adequately protect our data from cyberrelated security breaches or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes we may experience operational difficulties such as limitations on our ability to ship products increased costs manufacturing or service interruptions or delays loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data quality and compliance issues and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on secure information technology for our business and are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and cyber incidents affecting our and our service providers ’ systems and networks 

in the conduct of our business we collect use transmit and store data on information systems and networks including systems and networks owned and maintained by kla andor by thirdparty providers this data includes confidential information transactional information and intellectual property belonging to us our customers and our business partners as well as personally identifiable information of individuals despite network security measures our and our thirdparty providers’ information systems and networks are susceptible to computer viruses ransomware cyberrelated security breaches and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions tampering misuse or criminal acts made directly against or through our thirdparty providers in the supply chain and against our systems and networks including phishing or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate which are subject to the inherent vulnerabilities of network security measures we have experienced cyberrelated attacks in the past and are likely to experience cyberrelated attacks in the future our security measures may also be breached due to employee errors malfeasance or otherwise third parties may also attempt to influence employees users suppliers or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our our customers’ or business partners’ data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to the information systems change frequently may not be recognized until launched against a target and are increasingly designed to circumvent controls to avoid detection and to remove or obfuscate forensic artifacts we may be unable to anticipate these techniques to implement adequate preventative measures or to adequately identify and investigate cybersecurity incidents 

any cybersecurity incident or occurrence could impact our business directly or indirectly by impacting third parties in the supply chain in many potential ways disruptions to operations misappropriation corruption or theft of confidential information including intellectual property and other critical data of kla our customers and other business partners misappropriation of funds and company assets reduced value of our investments in research development and engineering litigation with or payment of damages to third parties reputational damage costs to comply with regulatory inquiries or actions data privacy issues costs to rebuild our information systems and networks and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs 

we carry insurance that provides limited protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident but it will not likely cover all such losses and the losses that it does not cover may be significant 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact our business operations 

our global operations are dependent upon certain information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications system failures or malfunctions such as difficulties with our customer relationship management system could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results our enterprise resource planning “erp” system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records record transactions provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems whether in connection with the regular operation periodic enhancements modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems or due to cybersecurity events such as ransomware attacks could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort in february 2019 we announced that we had consummated our orbotech acquisition we may also enter into definitive agreements for and consummate acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses if the costs associated with integrating the acquired business exceeds our expectations or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than anticipated in addition we may lose key employees of the acquired companies risks associated with acquisition transactions may lead to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for an additional number of reasons including 

• we may have to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to acquired businesses 

• the combination of businesses may result in the loss of key personnel or an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our company andor the acquired business 

• we may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from our acquisitions 

• we may experience challenges in entering into new market segments for which we have not previously manufactured and sold products 

• we may face difficulties in coordinating geographically separated organizations systems and facilities 

• the customers distributors suppliers employees and others with whom the companies we acquire have business dealings may have a potentially adverse reaction to the acquisition 

• we may have difficulty implementing a cohesive framework of internal controls over the entire organization 

• we may have to writeoff goodwill or other intangible assets and 

• we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions 

at times we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary highly sensitive information the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations or in the operations of our customers due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states singapore israel germany united kingdom italy and china in addition our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors as well as our other operations and those of our customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics and pandemics fire earthquake volcanic eruptions energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites we cannot provide any assurance that alternate means of conducting our operations whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if such alternate means were available they could be obtained on favorable terms 

in addition as part of our costcutting actions we have consolidated several operating facilities our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above such as acts of war or terrorism earthquakes fires or other natural disasters if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at or acts of war in the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the industries we serve could adversely affect our business increased international political instability in various parts of the world disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations we maintain significant operations in israel since the establishment of the state of israel in 1948 a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility varying in degree and intensity has led to security and economic challenges for israel in addition some of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and may be called to active military duty in emergency circumstances we cannot assess the impact that emergency conditions in israel in the future may have on our business operations financial condition or results of operations but it could be material instability in any region could directly impact our ability to operate our business or our customers’ ability to operate their businesses cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate instability in the region could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we selfinsure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain risks are uninsurable are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance accordingly we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds the applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy for example we do not currently hold earthquake insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations a significant portion of which are conducted in california an area highly susceptible to earthquakes it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products much of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we selfinsure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also selfinsured either based on a similar costbenefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the japanese yen the euro the pound sterling and the israeli new shekel we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally in addition an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the united states and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected furthermore if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge we may experience material financial losses 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments and an impairment of our investments could harm our earnings in addition we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that are susceptible to changes in market interest rates and bond yields as market interest rates and bond yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss an impairment of the fair market value of our investments even if unrealized must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

in addition the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets our operating results or other performance metrics or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies 

we are exposed to risks in connection with tax and regulatory compliance audits in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits such as related to customs or product safety requirements in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes penalties fines or other prohibitions against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that our products and practices comply with applicable regulations the final determination of any such audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals related to income taxes and other contingencies in addition to and in connection with the israel tax authority “ita” assessment described in more detail in note 14 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements there is an ongoing criminal investigation against our orbotech subsidiary certain of its employees and its tax consultant that began prior to the acquisition date we can make no assurances that an indictment will not result from the criminal investigation the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

we earn profits in and are therefore potentially subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions including singapore israel and the cayman islands the countries in which we earn the majority of our nonus profits due to economic political or other conditions tax rates in those jurisdictions may be subject to significant change a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in the tax rates imposed by those jurisdictions expiration of tax holidays in certain jurisdictions that are not renewed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development “iprd” and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in stockbased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of earnings from outside the us for which we have not previously provided for us taxes a change in our effective tax rate can materially and adversely impact our results from operations 

in addition recent changes to us tax laws will significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which was enacted into law on december 22 2017 however the recent us tax law changes are subject to future guidance from us federal and state governments such as the treasury department andor the irs any future guidance can change our tax liability a significant portion of the income taxes due to the enactment of the tax act is payable by us over a period of eight years as a result our cash flows from operating activities will be adversely impacted until tax liability is paid in full numerous countries are evaluating their existing tax laws due in part to recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting project furthermore president biden put forth several corporate income tax proposals during his campaign including a significant increase in the corporate income tax rate and changes in the taxation of nonus income while it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals if enacted they could have a material impact on our income tax liability 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements has become increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices or changes in interpretations of such standards practices or rules can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting standards and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future changes to or revised interpretations or applications of existing accounting standards or tax rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business adoption of new standards may require changes to our processes accounting systems and internal controls difficulties encountered during adoption could result in internal control deficiencies or delay the reporting of our financial results 

risks associated with our industry 

ongoing changes in the technology industry as well as the semiconductor industry in particular could expose our business to significant risks 

the industries that we serve including the semiconductor fpd and pcb industries are constantly developing and changing over time many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve pricing trends in the endmarkets for consumer electronics and other products which place a growing emphasis on our customers’ cost of ownership changes in our customers’ capital spending patterns and in general an environment of constant change and development including decreasing product and component dimensions use of new materials and increasingly complex device structures applications and process steps if we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends or with respect to technological advances if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry as a significant majority of our sales are our process control and yield management products sold to semiconductor manufacturers some of the trends that our management monitors in operating our business include the following 

• the potential for reversal of the longterm historical trend of declining cost per transistor with each new generation of technological advancement within the semiconductor industry and the adverse impact that such reversal may have upon our business 

• the increasing cost of building and operating fabrication facilities and the impact of such increases on our customers’ capital equipment investment decisions 

• differing market growth rates and capital requirements for different applications such as memory and foundrylogic 

• lower level of process control adoption by our memory customers compared to our foundrylogic customers 

• our customers’ reuse of existing and installed products which may decrease their need to purchase new products or solutions at more advanced technology nodes 

• the emergence of disruptive technologies that change the prevailing semiconductor manufacturing processes or the economics associated with semiconductor manufacturing and as a result also impact the inspection and metrology requirements associated with such processes 

• the higher design costs for the most advanced ics which could economically constrain leadingedge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications 

• the possible introduction of integrated products by our larger competitors that offer inspection and metrology functionality in addition to managing other semiconductor manufacturing processes 

• changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes that are extremely costly for our customers to implement and accordingly our customers could reduce their available budgets for process control equipment by reducing inspection and metrology sampling rates for certain technologies 

• the bifurcation of the semiconductor manufacturing industry into a leading edge manufacturers driving continued rd into nextgeneration products and technologies and b other manufacturers that are content with existing including previous generation products and technologies 

• the ever escalating cost of nextgeneration product development which may result in joint development programs between us and our customers or government entities to help fund such programs that could restrict our control of ownership of and profitability from the products and technologies developed through those programs and 

• the entry by some semiconductor manufacturers into collaboration or sharing arrangements for capacity cost or risk with other manufacturers as well as increased outsourcing of their manufacturing activities and greater focus only on specific markets or applications whether in response to adverse market conditions or other market pressures 

any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers’ rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce which could result in downward pressure on our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been highly concentrated due to corporate consolidation acquisitions and business closures in this environment orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales this increasing concentration exposes our business financial condition and operating results to a number of risks including the following 

• the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year which exposes our business and operating results to increased volatility tied to individual customers 

• new orders from our foundrylogic customers in the past several years have constituted a significant portion of our total orders this concentration increases the impact that future business or technology changes within the foundrylogic industry may have on our business financial condition and operating results 

• in a highly concentrated business environment if a particular customer does not place an order or if they delay or cancel orders we may not be able to replace the business furthermore because our process control and yield management products are configured to each customer’s specifications any changes delays or cancellations of orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs 

• as a result of this consolidation the customers that survive the consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales and consequently have greater commercial negotiating leverage many of our large customers have more aggressive policies regarding engaging alternative secondsource suppliers for the products we offer and in addition may seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that may have an adverse impact on our business any of these changes could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins 

• certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes created alliances with other companies experienced management changes or have outsourced manufacturing activities any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions any future change in ownership or management of our existing customers may result in similar challenges including the possibility of the successor entity or new management deciding to select a competitor’s products 

• the highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers for example as a result of the challenging economic environment during fiscal year 2009 we were and in some cases continue to be exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial viability of certain of our customers to the extent our customers experience liquidity issues in the future we may be required to incur additional credit losses with respect to receivables owed to us by those customers in addition customers with liquidity issues may be forced to reduce purchases of our equipment delay deliveries of our products discontinue operations or may be acquired by one of our customers and in either case such event would have the effect of further consolidating our customer base 

• semiconductor manufacturers generally must commit significant resources to qualify install and integrate process control and yield management equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s process control and yield management equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for that specific production line application and other similar production line applications if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment 

• prices differ among the products we offer for different applications due to differences in features offered or manufacturing costs if there is a shift in demand by our customers from our higherpriced to lowerpriced products our gross margin and revenues would decrease in addition when products are initially introduced they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation which can impact gross margin 

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we operate in industries that have historically been cyclical including the semiconductor industry the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the condition of the industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the industries in which we serve are difficult to predict the historically cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry in which we primarily operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization consumer demand for products inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in or cancellation or delay of orders which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customer’s funding status which could be weakened not only by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or companyspecific reasons but also by funding limitations imposed by the customer’s unique organizational structure any of these factors could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results then our business could be seriously harmed furthermore any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

in addition our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics which when made are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time however largely due to the historical cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles our actual results may vary and have varied in the past from forecasted results these variations can occur for any number of reasons including but not limited to unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders product shipments or product acceptance an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to adapt to changing business conditions or a different than anticipated effective tax rate the impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment this is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues but also due to the advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order to meet the expected lead times to significant inventory writeoffs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided we provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of management’s expectations for the future but those reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of and are themselves forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this item 1a and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements if our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts or if we revise our forecasts the market price of our common stock could decline 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the industries in which we serve including the semiconductor fpd and pcb industries depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver appears to be slowing which may cause semiconductor manufacturers to delay investments in equipment investigate more complex device architectures use new materials and develop innovative fabrication processes these and other evolving customer plans and needs require us to respond with continued development programs and cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business 

success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards develop and introduce new products and solutions that successfully address changing customer needs win market acceptance of these new products and solutions and manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner our failure to accurately predict evolving industry standards and develop as well as offer competitive technology solutions in a timely manner with costeffective products could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

we must continue to make significant investments in rd in order to enhance the performance features and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands substantial rd costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

in addition the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks we regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer even before receiving the customer’s formal acceptance of that product in certain situations including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted however our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents all of which must perform to their respective specifications so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall product’s required specifications in such a situation the customer may be entitled to certain remedies which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and as a result our stock price 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of inspection products as a result any delay or reduction of sales of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results the continued customer demand for these products and the development introduction and market acceptance of new products and technologies are critical to our future success 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own which may adversely affect our business in addition we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product rd projects the termination of any such collaboration or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration could significantly impair our rd efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of continuing significant investments in product rd however we may enter new markets whether through acquisitions or new internal product development in which competition is based primarily on product pricing not technological superiority further some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing through our business interruption planning we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by among other things monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers certain key parts are available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers also key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers’ proprietary intellectual property in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for highperformance hightechnology components which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products in addition if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations which is a heightened risk especially during economic downturns it could affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products similarly especially with respect to suppliers of hightechnology components our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in a timely manner and result in delays for our products our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms furthermore a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons including the supplier’s financial condition or business operational decisions which would require us to purchase in a single transaction a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers such “endoflife” parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory writeoff either of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods refer to the executive summary in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for additional information on supply constraints related to the covid19 pandemic 

if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan our operating results business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted 

we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually revised frequently generally quarterly and reviewed by management even more frequently at least monthly our business plan is developed based on a number of factors many of which require estimates and assumptions such as our expectations of the economic environment future business levels our customers’ willingness and ability to place orders leadtimes and future revenue and cash flow our budgeted operating expenses for example are based in part on our future revenue expectations however our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors including the volatile and historically cyclical nature of our primary industry customer order cancellations macroeconomic changes operational matters regarding particular agreements our ability to manage customer deliveries the availability of resources for the installation of our products delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a 

because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results similarly if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period which would also negatively affect our results of operations if we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted such an outcome could cause customers suppliers or investors to view us as less stable or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates any of which could have an adverse impact on our stock price 

in addition our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources the need to manage our operating model and other factors in furtherance of those efforts we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries installations and payment scheduling any such decisions may impact our ability to recognize revenue including the fiscal period during which such revenue may be recognized with respect to such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or stock price 

we have a leveraged capital structure 

as of june 30 2021 we had 347 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness consisting of 345 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes in november 2017 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” providing for a 7500 million fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” which replaced our prior credit facility subject to the terms of the credit agreement the revolving credit facility may be increased by an amount up to 2500 million in the aggregate we have no borrowings under our revolving credit facility and an additional 100 billion in unfunded commitments we may incur additional indebtedness in the future by accessing the unfunded portion of our revolving credit facility andor entering into new financing arrangements for example at the same time we announced our intention to acquire orbotech we also announced a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase up to 300 billion of our common stock a large portion of which may be financed with new indebtedness our ability to pay interest and repay the principal amount of our current indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations our credit rating the ongoing interest rate environment and the other risk factors discussed in this item 1a there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of our senior notes as defined below by at least two of moody’s investors service “moodys” sp global ratings “sp” and fitch inc “fitch” unless we have exercised our right to redeem the senior notes of such series we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or at the holder’s option any part of each holder’s senior notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below the “change of control offer” in the change of control offer we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of senior notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any on the senior notes repurchased up to but not including the date of repurchase we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time nor that we will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of that series of senior notes our ability to repurchase that series of senior notes in such event may be limited by law by the indenture associated with that series of senior notes or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time if we fail to repurchase that series of senior notes as required by the terms of such senior notes it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing that series of senior notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under our other obligations 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate and an increase in interest rates would require us to pay additional interest on any borrowings which may have an adverse effect on the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline the interest rate under our revolving credit facility is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades additionally under our revolving credit facility we are required to comply with affirmative and negative covenants which include the maintenance of certain financial ratios the details of which can be found in note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

if we fail to comply with these covenants we will be in default and our borrowings will become immediately due and payable there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources nor that we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time in addition certain of our domestic subsidiaries are required to guarantee our borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the event we default on our borrowings these domestic subsidiaries shall be liable for our borrowings which could disrupt our operations and result in a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

our leveraged capital structure may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and net income per share 

our substantial amount of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to 

• a negative impact on our ability to satisfy our future obligations 

• an increase in the portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments that may not be available for operations working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments dividends stock repurchases general corporate or other purposes 

• an impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and 

• obligations to comply with restrictive and financial covenants as noted in the above risk factor and note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

our ability to satisfy our future expenses as well as our debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our future operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our future expenses and service our debt obligations which may impact our ability to manage our capital structure to preserve and maintain our investment grade rating if our future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows we may need to access the money available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility or enter into new financing arrangements to obtain necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms any borrowings under our revolving credit facility will place further pressure on us to comply with the financial covenants if we fail to make a payment associated with our debt obligations we could be in default on such debt and such a default could cause us to be in default on our other obligations 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us however future dividends may be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our rd legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws changes to our business model and our increased interest and principal payments required by our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions including our indemnification of third parties as well as the performance of our products 

although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties costly and timeconsuming litigation or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes or could impact our revenue or cost recognition any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in our commercial agreements from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers suppliers and lessors with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants thirdparty claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties or other claims made against certain parties we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes in addition notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations whether or not asserted due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects especially when products are first introduced unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us including increased service or warranty costs providing product replacements for or modifications to defective products litigation related to defective products reimbursement for damages caused by our products product recalls or product writeoffs or disposal costs these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business financial condition and operating results in addition our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

furthermore we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives such as credits toward future purchases we believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our longterm business as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase larger volumes of our products however these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives our volume purchase agreements require significant estimation for the amounts to be accrued depending upon the estimate of volume of future purchases as such we are required to update our estimates of the accruals on a periodic basis until the earnings process is complete our estimates could differ in comparison to actual results as a result these volume purchase arrangements while expected to be beneficial to our business over time could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in nearterm periods including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and therefore our gross margins 

in addition we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customerspecific commitments on pricing tool reliability spare parts stocking levels response time and other commitments furthermore we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection to date we have made no significant accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in supporting an audit or inspection or defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

there are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development 

we are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies both domestically and internationally governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion or a project may be terminated by mutual agreement if the parties determine that the project’s goals or milestones are not being achieved so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future in addition under the terms of these government grants the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur directly and indirectly in connection with such programs any such audit could result in modifications to or even termination of the applicable government funding program for example if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program those costs would not be reimbursed and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded we do not know the outcome of any future audits any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties financial or otherwise termination of funding programs suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency any of which could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations 

historically we have recorded material restructuring charges related to our prior global workforce reductions large excess inventory writeoffs and material impairment charges related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans or do so within the expected time frame if we again restructure our organization and business processes implement additional costreduction actions or discontinue certain business operations we may take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to among other things employee terminations or exit costs we may also be required to writeoff additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline also as our lead times from suppliers increase due to the increasing complexity of the parts and components they provide and the lead times demanded by our customers decrease due to the time pressures they face when introducing new products or technology or bringing new facilities into production we may be compelled to increase our commitments and therefore our risk exposure to inventory purchases to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner and that inventory may need to be writtenoff if demand for the underlying product declines for any reason such additional writeoffs could result in material charges 

we have recorded material charges related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives based on economic benefit if known or using the straightline method and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for longlived assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including but not limited to declines in our operating cash flows declines in our stock price or market capitalization declines in our market share and declines in revenues or profits a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and as applicable the amount of any previous impairment charge could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge 

any such additional material charges whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements 

we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements 

we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions any of which may prove not to be financially viable if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables however by entering into these arrangements and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services we are exposed to additional risks if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such 

arrangements or a lack of access to our funds any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered 

in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws if we were to violate any such law we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

executive summary 

we are a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions and services for the semiconductor and related electronics industries our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products and related service software and other offerings support rd and manufacturing of ics wafers and reticles our products services and expertise are used by our customers to measure detect analyze and resolve critical and nanometric level product defects helping them to manage manufacturing process challenges and to obtain higher finish product yields at lower cost we also offer advanced technology solutions to address various manufacturing needs of pcbs fpds specialty semiconductor devices and other electronic components including advanced packaging led power devices compound semiconductor and data storage industries as well as general materials research 

our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or both of the major semiconductor device manufacturing markets memory and foundrylogic the pervasive and increasing needs for semiconductors in many consumer and industrial products the rapid proliferation of new applications for more advanced semiconductor devices and the increasing complexity associated with leading edge semiconductor manufacturing drives demand for our process control and yield management solutions other demand trends include the growth of endmarket drivers such as ai the deployment of 5g telecommunications technology and associated highend mobile devices the electrification and digitalization of the automotive industry the revival of personal computer demand and associated innovations to support remote work virtual collaboration remote learning and entertainment and the growth of the internet of things “iot” the favorable end market dynamics are driving our customers to make increased investments in our process control and yield management solutions as part of their overall capital investment plans these trends also drive demand for our other products such as those used in the pcb fpd and specialty semiconductor manufacturing where the increase in technology complexity is expected to continue and further accelerate as more devices become interconnected and dependent on other electronic devices as a result of these factors we saw a general strengthening of demand for our products throughout fiscal 2021 our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry has become increasingly concentrated so large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales which potentially exposes us to more earnings volatility 

we are organized into four reportable segments 

• semiconductor process control a comprehensive portfolio of inspection metrology and data analytics products as well as related service offerings that help ic manufacturers achieve target yields throughout the semiconductor fabrication process from rd to final volume production 

• specialty semiconductor process advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers 

• pcb display and component inspection a range of inspection testing and measurement and di for patterning products used by manufacturers of pcbs fpds advanced packaging mems and other electronic components 

• other products that do not fall into the three segments above 

a majority of our revenues are derived from outside the united states and include geographic regions such as taiwan china korea japan europe and israel and rest of asia china is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ics additionally a significant portion of global fpd and pcb manufacturing has migrated to china government initiatives are propelling china to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting investment from semiconductor manufacturers from taiwan korea japan and the united states although china is currently seen as an important longterm growth region for the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment sector commerce has added certain chinabased entities to the us entity list restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without a license in addition commerce has imposed new export licensing requirements 

on chinabased customers engaged in military end uses as well as requiring our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on us technology to manufacture products connected to huawei or its affiliates while these new rules have not significantly impacted our operations to date such actions by the us government or another country could impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers and adversely affect our business 

the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years 1  



 

1 on february 20 2019 we completed the orbotech acquisition for total consideration of approximately 3 billion the operating results of orbotech have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date for additional details refer to note 6 “business combinations” to our consolidated financial statements 

2 our net income attributable to kla for the year ended june 30 2020 includes a pretax goodwill impairment charge of 2566 million and a pretax charge of 225 million as a result of the extinguishment of debt for additional details refer to note 7 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” and note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

impact of covid19 

events surrounding the covid19 pandemic had resulted in a reduction in economic activity across the globe in calendar year 2020 vaccinations and pandemic containment measures have now created an environment that is driving economic growth even as pace of economic recovery remains uneven in various geographies the resumption of growth has caused us to experience new constraints in our supply chain supply lead times are extended and shortages have sometimes required us to increase our purchase commitments to secure critical components on a timely basis 

while all of our global sites are currently operational any local pandemic outbreaks could require us to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates we remain committed to the health and safety of our employees contractors suppliers customers and communities and are following government policies and recommendations designed to slow the spread of covid19 

our efforts to respond to the covid19 pandemic have included health screenings social distancing employee separation protocols at our facilities suspension of nonessential business travel and work from home to the extent possible we are working with government authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate and continuing to monitor our operations in an effort to ensure we follow government requirements relevant regulations industry standards and best practices to help safeguard our team members while safely continuing operations to the extent possible at our sites across the globe 

we believe these actions are appropriate and prudent to safeguard our employees contractors suppliers customers and communities while allowing us to safely continue operations we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and stakeholders or as required by federal state or local authorities 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following 

revenue recognition we primarily derive revenue from the sale of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries maintenance and support of all these products installation and training services and the sale of spare parts our portfolio also includes yield enhancement and production solutions used by manufacturers of pcbs fpds advanced packaging mems and other electronic components our solutions are generally not sold with a right of return nor have we experienced significant returns from or refunds to our customers 

we account for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties the rights of the parties are identified payment terms are identified the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable our revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties such as sales taxes the revenues are recognized as separate performance obligations that are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to the customer our arrangements with our customers include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations a product or service is considered distinct if it is separately identifiable from other deliverables in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer the transaction consideration including any sales incentives is allocated between separate performance obligations of an arrangement based on the standalone selling prices “ssp” for each distinct product or service management considers a variety of factors to determine the ssp such as historical standalone sales of products and services discounting strategies and other observable data from time to time our contracts are modified to account for additional or to change existing performance obligations our contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively 

product revenue 

we recognize revenue from product sales at a point in time when we have satisfied our performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer we use judgment to evaluate whether control has transferred by considering several indicators including whether 

• we have a present right to payment 

• the customer has legal title 

• the customer has physical possession 

• the customer has significant risk and rewards of ownership and 

• the customer has accepted the product or whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of similar products for example when the customer has previously accepted the same tool with the same specifications and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria and when the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory 

not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer in circumstances in which revenue is recognized prior to the product acceptance the portion of revenue associated with our performance obligations to install product is deferred and recognized upon acceptance 

we enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers we adjust the transaction consideration for estimated credits earned by our customers for such incentives these credits are estimated based upon the forecasted and actual product sales for any given period and agreedupon incentive rate the estimate is updated at each reporting period 

we offer perpetual and term licenses for software products the primary difference between perpetual and term licenses is the duration over which the customer can benefit from the use of the software while the functionality and the features of the software are the same software is generally bundled with postcontract customer support “pcs” which includes unspecified software updates that are made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement revenue from software licenses is recognized at a point in time when the software is made available to the customer revenue from pcs is deferred at contract inception and recognized ratably over the service period or as services are performed 

services and spare parts revenue 

the majority of product sales include a standard six to 12month warranty that is not separately paid for by the customers the customers may also purchase extended warranties for periods beyond the initial year as part of the initial product sale we have concluded that the standard 12month warranty as well as any extended warranty periods included in the initial product sales are separate performance obligations for most of our products the estimated fair value of warranty services is deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the warranty period as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of warranty services provided by us 

additionally we offer product maintenance and support services which the customer may purchase separately from the standard and extended warranty offered as part of the initial product sale revenue from separately negotiated maintenance and support service contracts is also recognized over time based on the terms of the applicable service period revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract including training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed we also sell spare parts revenue from which is recognized when control over the spare parts is transferred to the customer 

installation services include connecting and validating configuration of the product in addition several testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to customer specifications revenues from product installation are deferred and recognized at a point in time once installation is complete 

significant judgments 

our contracts with our customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services each product and service is generally capable of being distinct within the context of the contract and represents a separate performance obligation determining the ssp for each distinct performance obligation and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements we typically estimate the ssp of products and services based on observable transactions when the products and services are sold on a standalone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable range we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of these products by customers and circumstances in these instances we use information such as the size of the customer geographic region as well as customization of the products in determining the ssp in instances where the ssp is not directly observable we determine the ssp using information that includes market conditions entityspecific factors including discounting strategies information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs while changes in the allocation of ssp between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular contract any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

although the products are generally not sold with a right of return we may provide other credits or sales incentives which are accounted for either as variable consideration or material right depending on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement these credits and incentives are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if and when additional information becomes available 

as outlined above we use judgments to evaluate whether or not the customer has obtained control of the product and consider several indicators in evaluating whether or not control has transferred to the customer not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer 

contract assetsliabilities 

the timing of revenue recognition billings and cash collections may result in accounts receivable contract assets and contract liabilities deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets a receivable is recorded in the period we deliver products or provide services when we have an unconditional right to payment contract assets primarily relate to the value of products and services transferred to the customer for which the right to payment is not just dependent on the passage of time contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when rights to payment become unconditional 

a contract liability is recognized when we receive payment or have an unconditional right to payment in advance of the satisfaction of performance the contract liabilities represent 1 deferred product revenue related to the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers and for which control has not been transferred to the customers and 2 deferred service revenue which is recorded when we receive consideration or such consideration is unconditionally due from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a contract deferred service revenue typically results from warranty services and maintenance and other service contracts 

contract assets and liabilities related to rights and obligations in a contract are recorded net in the consolidated balance sheets 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales customer contracts and acquired technologies expected costs to develop iprd into commercially viable products estimated cash flows from the projects when completed including 

assumptions associated with the technology migration curve estimated royalty rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets and discount rates the discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired including iprd based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which will not exceed one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 

the fair value of iprd is initially capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the iprd assets may not be recoverable impairment of iprd is recorded to rd expenses when an iprd project is completed the iprd is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized to costs of revenues over the asset’s estimated useful life 

acquisitionrelated expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or net realizable value net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value we review and set standard costs semiannually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

allowance for credit losses a majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor and electronics manufacturers throughout the world we maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable and assess collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues the estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts the allowance for credit losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance however volatility in market conditions and evolving credit trends are difficult to predict and may cause variability that may have a material impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods 

accounting for stockbased compensation plans compensation expense for restricted stock units “rsus” with performance metrics is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant or when a grant contains a market condition the grant date fair value using a monte carlo simulation the monte carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the award’s expected life the price volatility of the underlying stock as well as the potential outcomes of the market condition on the grant date of each award 

contingencies and litigation we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs incurred to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see note 16 “commitments and contingencies” and note 15 “litigation and other legal matters” to our consolidated financial statements for additional details 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets  impairment assessments we review goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable pursuant to the authoritative guidance we make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and allocate shared assets and liabilities to those reporting units which determines the carrying values for each reporting unit when assessing goodwill for impairment an initial assessment of qualitative factors determines whether the 

existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value judgments related to qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance relevant entityspecific events a sustained decrease in share price and other events affecting the reporting units if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value including goodwill if the former is lower goodwill is written down by the excess amount limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit see note 7 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the market approach when deemed appropriate and the necessary information is available or the income approach which uses discounted cash flow “dcf” analysis or a combination of both if multiple valuation methodologies are used the results are weighted determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about appropriate discount rates revenue growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows discount rates are based on a weightedaverage cost of capital “wacc” which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity plus a risk premium the wacc used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts the market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies 

we review purchased finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of the assets are shorter than initially expected we determine whether finitelived intangible assets are recoverable based on the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowestlevel associated asset grouping assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective if the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the longlived assets’ carrying value we recognize an impairment loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable the authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill it allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset the qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is morelikelythannot that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value our indefinitelived intangible assets are iprd intangible assets 

any impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and net asset value in the quarter in which we recognize the impairment charge see note 7 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires income tax effects for changes in tax laws to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the 

weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activities any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

we record income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us our effective tax rate would be adversely affected if we change our intent or if such undistributed earnings are needed for us operations because we would be required to provide or pay income taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings 

global intangible lowtaxed income the tax act includes provisions for global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations this income will effectively be taxed at a 105 tax rate in general as a result our deferred tax assets and liabilities were evaluated to determine if the deferred tax assets and liabilities should be recognized for the basis differences expected to reverse as a result of gilti provisions that are effective for us after the fiscal year ending june 30 2018 or if the tax on gilti provisions should be recognized as period costs in each year incurred we elected to account for gilti as a component of current period tax expense starting from the first quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30 2019

results of operations 

revenues and gross margin   



product revenues 

our business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles in the preceding period 

the increase in product revenues by 21 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to strong demand for many of our products especially our inspection and metrology portfolios due to the continued growth in the 5g market and increased demand for highperformance computing and advanced packaging these increases were partially offset by softer demand and oversupply in the display markets 

service revenues 

service revenues are generated from product maintenance and support services as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers the amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems but it is also impacted by other factors such as our rate of service contract renewals the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

the increase in service revenues by 14 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites 

revenues by segment 1 



 

1 segment revenues exclude corporate allocations and the effects of foreign currency exchange rates for additional details refer to note 19 “segment reporting and geographic information” to our consolidated financial statements 

2 orbotech was acquired on february 20 2019 

revenue from our semiconductor process control segment increased by 21 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to a strong demand for many of our products especially from our inspection and metrology portfolios the increase in revenues from our specialty semiconductor process and pcb display and component inspection segments is primarily driven by continued growth in advanced packaging highperformance computing technologies and 5g infrastructure partially offset by softer demand and oversupply in the fpd market 

revenues  top customers 

the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues primarily in our semiconductor process control segment for the indicated periods 



revenues by region 

we have revised the fiscal 2020 revenue by geographic regions as presented below as well as in note 19 “segment reporting and geographic information” the revisions were to correct the amount of revenue allocated to each geographic region these revisions had no impact on the previously issued consolidated balance sheet statements of operations statements of cash flows statements of comprehensive income loss or statements of stockholders’ equity as of and for the yearended june 30 2020 and we determined that the impact of the revisions was not material to our previously issued consolidated financial statements 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows 



a significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that trend to continue 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions 

the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage 



changes in gross margin percentage which are driven by the revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues revenue is impacted by average customer pricing customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates changes in gross margin percentage from the mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes within the composition of product and service offerings and amortization of inventory fair value adjustments from business combinations changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements and amortization of intangible assets changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support 

costs including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk 

the increase in our gross margin from 579 to 599 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 is primarily attributable to a higher revenue volume of products and services sold and a more profitable mix of products and services sold partially offset by an increase in service and manufacturing costs 

segment gross margin 1 



 

1 segment gross margin is calculated as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues and excludes corporate allocations and the effects of foreign currency exchange rates amortization of intangible assets inventory fair value adjustments and acquisitionrelated costs for additional details refer to note 19 “segment reporting and geographic information” to our consolidated financial statements 

2 orbotech was acquired on february 20 2019 

the primary factors impacting the performance of our segment gross margins for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 are summarized as follows 

• semiconductor process control segment gross margin increased due to a more profitable mix of products and services sold partially offset by an increase in service and manufacturing costs 

• the changes in the segment gross margins of the specialty semiconductor process pcb display and component inspection and other segments increased primarily due to a more favorable mix of products and services sold as well as a higher revenue volume of products and services sold 

research and development “rd”   



rd expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our rd efforts as technological innovation is essential to our success we may incur significant costs associated with rd projects including compensation for engineering talent engineering material costs and other expenses 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 545 million as a result of additional engineering headcount higher employee benefit costs and higher variable compensation and an increase in engineering project materials expenses of 226 million this is partially offset by a decrease in travelrelated expense of 113 million 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our rd we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies 

selling general and administrative “sga” 



sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 primarily due to a decrease in travelrelated expenses of 254 million and a decrease in depreciation and intangible amortization expense of 193 million these decreases were partially offset by an increase in employeerelated expenses of 195 million as the result of additional headcount higher employee benefit costs and variable compensation an increase in facility and office expense of 97 million and higher consulting costs of 66 million 

goodwill impairment 

we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of february 28 2021 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 as a result of our annual goodwill impairment testing for all reporting units we recorded 1442 million and 1125 million in impairment charges in the specialty semiconductor process and pcb and display reporting units respectively in the three months ended march 31 2020 

restructuring charges 

in september 2019 management approved a plan to streamline our organization and business processes that included the reduction of workforce primarily in our pcb display and component inspection segment 

restructuring charges were  124 million for the year ended june 30 2021 and included  39 million of noncash charges for accelerated depreciation related to certain rightofuse “rou” assets and fixed assets to be abandoned restructuring charges were  77 million for the year ended june 30 2020 

for additional information refer to note 20 “restructuring charges” to our consolidated financial statements 

interest expense and other expense income net 



the decrease in interest expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 was primarily due to lower interest expense on our revolving credit facility which is described further in the liquidity and capital resources section below 

other expense income net is comprised primarily of fair value adjustments and realized gains or losses on sales of marketable and nonmarketable securities gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts interestrelated accruals such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations and interest income earned on our invested cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

the decrease in other expense income net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 was primarily due to an initial fair value adjustment of 267 million from an equity security becoming marketable 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

we had no loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended june 30 2021 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 loss on extinguishment of debt reflected a pretax net loss of 225 million associated with the redemption of our 5000 million of senior notes due 2021 including associated redemption premiums accrued interest and other fees and expenses 

provision for income taxes 

the following table provides details of income taxes 



tax expense was higher as a percentage of income before taxes during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 primarily due to the impact of the following items 

• tax expense increased by 1072 million relating to the impact of a decrease in the proportion of klas earnings generated in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us statutory rate during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 

• tax expense increased by 411 million during the fiscal year ending june 30 2021 relating to an increase in our deferred tax liability on purchased intangibles due to an increase in the united kingdom statutory income tax rate effective april 2023 and 

• tax expense decreased by 343 million relating to the impact of an internal restructuring during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 partially offset by 

• tax expense decreased by 443 million relating to a decrease in our unrecognized tax benefit during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 and 

• tax expense increased by 539 million relating to a 2566 million goodwill impairment charge which is nondeductible for income tax during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 

our effective tax rate during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 was impacted by the tax act which was enacted into law on december 22 2017 the following items are the tax impacts as a result of the tax act 

• tax expense decreased by 499 million relating to the reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate from 281 to 210 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 and 

• tax expense decreased by 193 million relating to the transition tax liability during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income the amount of our pretax income as business activities fluctuate nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions rd credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income nontaxable or nondeductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

in the normal course of business we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world we are subject to federal income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 and are under us income tax examination for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 we are subject to us state income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 we are also subject to examinations in other major foreign jurisdictions including singapore and israel for all years beginning from the calendar year ended december 31 2012 we are under audit in germany related to orbotech for the calendar years ended december 31 2013 to december 31 2015 we have concluded our audit in israel related to kla for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017 to june 30 2020 although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

in may 2017 orbotech received an assessment from the ita with respect to its fiscal years 2012 through 2014 the “assessment” and the “audit period” respectively for an aggregate amount of tax after offsetting all net operating losses “nol” available through the end of 2014 of approximately nis 229 million equivalent to approximately 66 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the israeli consumer price index as of date of the issuance of the tax decrees 

on august 31 2018 orbotech filed an objection in respect of the tax assessment the “objection” the ita completed the second stage of the audit in which the claims orbotech raised in the objection were examined by different personnel at the ita in addition the ita examined additional items during this second stage of the audit as orbotech and the ita did not reach an agreement during the second stage the ita issued tax decrees to orbotech on august 28 2019 “tax decrees” for an aggregate amount of tax after offsetting all nols available through the end of 2014 of approximately nis 257 million equivalent to approximately 73 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the israeli consumer price index as of the date of the issuance of the tax decrees these tax decrees replaced the assessment we believe that our recorded unrecognized tax benefits are sufficient to cover the resolution of these tax decrees 

orbotech filed a notice of appeal with respect to the above tax decrees with the district court of tel aviv on september 26 2019 on february 27 2020 the ita filed its arguments in support of the tax decrees orbotech filed the grounds of appeal with respect to the above tax decrees on july 30 2020 we are currently in the pretrial hearing stage of the process the ita and orbotech are continuing discussions in an effort to resolve this matter in a mutually agreeable manner 

in connection with the above there is an ongoing criminal investigation in israel against orbotech certain of its employees and its tax consultant on april 11 2018 orbotech received a “suspect notification letter” dated march 28 2018 from the tel aviv district attorney’s office fiscal and financial in the letter it was noted that the investigation file was transferred from the assessment investigation officer to the district attorney’s office the letter further states that the district attorney’s office has not yet made a decision regarding submission of an indictment against orbotech and that if after studying the case a decision is made to consider prosecuting orbotech orbotech will receive an additional letter and within 30 days orbotech may present its arguments to the district attorney’s office as to why it should not be indicted on october 27 2019 we received a request for additional information from the district attorneys office we will continue to monitor the progress of the district attorney’s office investigation however we cannot anticipate when the review of the case will be completed and what will be the results thereof we intend to cooperate with the district attorney’s office to enable them to conclude their investigation 

in december 2020 orbotech received an assessment from the ita with respect to its fiscal years 2015 through 2018 the “second assessment” for an aggregate amount of tax after offsetting all nols available through the end of 2018 of approximately nis 227 million equivalent to approximately 68 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the israeli consumer price index as of date of the issuance of the second assessment we filed an objection to the second assessment with the ita in march 2021 the objection moved the 20152018 audit to the second stage in which the ita will review the objections we believe that our recorded unrecognized tax benefits are sufficient to cover the resolution of the second assessment 

on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security “cares act” which includes several tax relief provisions was signed into law as a result of the cares act we have deferred payment of certain payroll taxes to the us federal government through december 31 2022 and accelerated the tax deduction of qualified improvement property the provisions of the cares act do not have a material impact to our liquidity and we are not expecting a material tax refund 

liquidity and capital resources 



cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

as of june 30 2021 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 249 billion which represents an increase of 5141 million from june 30 2020 the increase is mainly due to net cash provided by operating activities of 219 billion partially offset by stock repurchases of 9386 million cash used for payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of 5594 million net cash usage of 2881 million related to the purchases sales and maturities of availableforsale and trading securities and capital expenditures of 2316 million 

as of june 30 2021 096 billion of our 249 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices we currently intend to indefinitely reinvest 060 billion of the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries for which we assert that earnings are permanently reinvested if however a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the united states we would be required to accrue and pay state and foreign taxes of approximately 122 of the funds repatriated the amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated we have accrued state and foreign tax on the remaining cash of 036 billion of the 096 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices as such these funds can be returned to the us without accruing any additional us tax expense 

cash dividends and special cash dividend 

the total amounts of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal years ended june 30 2021 2020 and 2019 were 5594 million 5224 million and 4694 million respectively the increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from 085 to 090 per share that was instituted during the three months ended september 30 2020 the amounts of accrued dividend equivalents payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested rsus with dividend equivalent rights were 103 million and 83 million as of june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively these amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested rsus as described in note 10 “equity longterm incentive compensation plans and noncontrolling interest” to our consolidated financial statements 

on august 5 2021 we announced that our board of directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of 105 per share refer to note 21 “subsequent events” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the declaration of our quarterly cash dividend announced subsequent to june 30 2021 

on november 19 2014 our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of 1650 per share on our outstanding common stock the total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by us at the declaration date was substantially paid out during the three months ended december 31 2014 and the final payment was made during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 other than the special cash dividend declared during the three months ended december 31 2014 we historically have not declared any special cash dividends 

stock repurchases 

the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended june 30 2021 and 2020 the stock repurchase program is intended in part to offset the dilution from our equity incentive plans shares issued in connection with the purchases under our espp and the issuance of shares in the orbotech acquisition as well as to return excess cash to our stockholders 

cash flows from operating activities 

we have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 increased by 041 billion compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 from 178 billion to 219 billion primarily as a result of the following factors 

• an increase in collections of approximately 1 billion mainly driven by higher shipments during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 partially offset by the following 

• a decrease in interest income of approximately 14 million mainly due to lower interest rates during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 

• an increase in accounts payable payments of approximately 445 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 

• an increase in employeerelated payments of approximately 119 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 

• an increase of longterm incentive payments of approximately 12 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 

• an increase in income tax payments of 1314 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 

net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 was 5004 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 2589 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 this increase in cash used was mainly due to an increase in net purchases of available for sale and trading securities of 2709 million and an increase in cash paid to purchase fixed assets of 790 million partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for a business acquisition of 901 million and an increase in cash received from sale of a business of 168 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 from 130 billion to 150 billion this increase was mainly due to an increase in cash used for stock repurchases of 1095 million an increase in net debt repayments of 505 million and cash paid for dividends and dividend equivalents of 369 million 

senior notes 

in february 2020 march 2019 and november 2014 we issued 7500 million 120 billion and 250 billion respectively the “2020 senior notes” “2019 senior notes” and “2014 senior notes” respectively and collectively the “senior notes” aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes in february 2020 and october 2019 we repaid 5000 million and 2500 million of senior notes respectively 

in february 2020 sp upgraded its credit rating of the company to “bbb” and revised its outlook to stable which permanently removed interest rate adjustments and the interest rate on the 2014 senior notes became fixed the interest rates for each series of the 2020 senior notes and 2019 senior notes are not subject to adjustments 

in january 2020 we entered into a series of forward contracts “2020 rate lock agreements” to lock the 30year treasury rate the “benchmark interest rate” with respect to the 2020 rate lock agreements on a portion of the 2020 senior notes the 2020 rate lock agreements had a notional amount of 3500 million in aggregate and matured in the same quarter the 2020 rate lock agreements were terminated on the date of the pricing of the 7500 million of 3300 senior notes due in 2050 and we recorded the fair value of 215 million as a loss within accumulated other comprehensive income loss “aoci” as of march 31 2020 which is being amortized over the life of the debt during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 we entered into a series of forward contracts the “2018 rate lock agreements” to lock the benchmark interest rate with notional amount of 5000 million in aggregate in october 2014 we entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10year treasury rate the “benchmark interest rate” with respect to the 2014 rate lock agreements on a portion of the 2014 senior notes with a notional amount of 100 billion in aggregate for additional details refer to note 17 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” and note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

the original discounts on the 2020 senior notes the 2019 senior notes and the 2014 senior notes amounted to 03 million 67 million and 40 million respectively and are being amortized over the life of the debt interest is payable as follows semiannually on march 1 and september 1 of each year for the 2020 senior notes semiannually on march 15 and september 15 of each year for the 2019 senior notes and semiannually on may 1 and november 1 of each year for the 2014 senior notes the indenture for the senior notes the “indenture” includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of senior notes by at least two of moody’s sp and fitch unless we have exercised our rights to redeem the senior notes of such series we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or at the holder’s option any part of each holder’s senior notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below the “change of control offer” in the change of control offer we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of senior notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any on the senior notes repurchased up to but not including the date of repurchase 

as of june 30 2021 we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the indenture associated with the senior notes 

revolving credit facility 

in november 2017 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” providing for a 7500 million fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” which replaced our prior credit facility subject to the terms of the credit agreement the revolving credit facility may be increased by an amount up to 2500 million in the 

aggregate in november 2018 we entered into an incremental facility extension and amendment agreement the “amendment” which amended the credit agreement to a extend the maturity date the “maturity date” from november 30 2022 to november 30 2023 b increase the total commitment by 2500 million and c effect certain other amendments to the credit agreement as set forth in the amendment after giving effect to the amendment the total commitments under the credit agreement amount to 100 billion during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 we made a principal payment of 500 million as of june 30 2021 we had no outstanding aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

we may borrow repay and reborrow funds under the revolving credit facility until the maturity date at which time such revolving credit facility will terminate and all outstanding loans under such facility together with all accrued and unpaid interest must be repaid we may prepay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at any time without a prepayment penalty 

borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at our option at either i the alternative base rate “abr” plus a spread which ranges from 0 bps to 75 bps or ii the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a spread which ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps the spreads under abr and libor are subject to adjustment in conjunction with credit rating downgrades or upgrades we are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility which ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps subject to an adjustment in conjunction with changes to our credit rating as of june 30 2021 we elected to pay interest on the borrowed amount under the revolving credit facility at libor plus a spread of 1000 bps and we pay an annual commitment fee of 10 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility 

the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the credit agreement on a quarterly basis covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 350 to 100 in addition we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the credit agreement on a quarterly basis of 300 to 100 covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter which can be increased to 400 to 100 for a period of time in connection with a material acquisition or a series of material acquisitions as of june 30 2021 our maximum allowed leverage ratio was 300 to 100 

we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement as of june 30 2021 the interest expense coverage ratio was 1870 to 100 and the leverage ratio was 118 to 100 considering our current liquidity position shortterm financial forecasts and ability to prepay the revolving credit facility if necessary we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our fiscal year ending june 30 2022 

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june 30 2021   



 

1 represents 345 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due from fiscal year 2025 to fiscal year 2050 and 200 million principal amount of notes payable due in fiscal year 2022 

2 the interest payments associated with the senior notes payable included in the table above are based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable interest rate for each series of senior notes our future interest payments are subject to change if our then effective credit rating is below investment grade as discussed above the interest payment under the revolving credit facility for the undrawn balance is payable at 10 bps as a commitment fee based on the daily undrawn balance and we utilized the existing rate for the projected interest payments included in the table above our future interest payments for the revolving credit facility are subject to change due to any upgrades or downgrades to our then effective credit rating 

3 represents an estimate of significant commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as an estimate of significant purchase commitments associated with goods services and other assets in the ordinary course of business our obligation under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecasted timehorizon can vary among different suppliers actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 

4 represents the estimated income tax payable obligation related to uncertain tax positions as well as related accrued interest we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 

5 operating lease obligations represent the undiscounted lease payments under noncancelable leases but exclude nonlease components 

6 as part of our employee compensation program we issue cashbased longterm incentive “cash lti” awards to many of our employees cash lti awards issued to employees under the cash longterm incentive plan “cash lti plan” generally vest in three or four equal installments the amounts in the table above are those committed under the cash lti plan the expected total payment after estimated forfeitures is approximately 209 million for additional details refer to note 10 “equity longterm incentive compensation plans and noncontrolling interest” to our consolidated financial statements 

7 represents an estimate of expected benefit payments up to fiscal year 2031 that was actuarially determined and excludes the minimum cash required to contribute to the plan as of june 30 2021 our defined benefit pension plans do not have material required minimum cash contribution obligations 

8 represents the amount committed under our nonqualified executive deferred compensation plan we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to the uncertainties in the timing around participant’s separation and any potential changes that participants may decide to make to the previous distribution elections 

9 represents the transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings resulting from the enactment of the tax act into law on december 22 2017 

10 represents severance payments due upon dismissal of an employee or upon termination of employment in certain other circumstances as required under israeli law 

11 represents amounts committed for accrued dividends payable for quarterly cash dividends for unvested rsus granted with dividend equivalent rights for additional details refer to note 10 “equity longterm incentive compensation plans and noncontrolling interest” to our consolidated financial statements 

we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we periodically sell certain letters of credit “lc” without recourse received from customers as payment for goods and services 

the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lc for the indicated periods 



factoring and lc fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense income net and were not material for the periods presented 

we maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to 752 million of which 597 million had been issued as of june 30 2021 primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for valueadded tax “vat” and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in europe israel and asia 

working capital 

working capital was 359 billion as of june 30 2021 which represents an increase of 5693 million compared to our working capital as of june 30 2020 as of june 30 2021 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 249 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity may be affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business spending for business acquisitions and other factors such as uncertainty in the global and regional economies and the semiconductor semiconductorrelated and electronic device industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our 100 billion revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs capital expenditures cash dividends stock repurchases and other contractual obligations including repayment of outstanding debt for at least the next 12 months 

our credit ratings as of june 30 2021 are summarized below 



in june 2021 moodys upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from baa1 to a2 factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries our financial position material acquisitions and changes in our business strategy 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of june 30 2021 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial position changes in financial condition revenues and expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors refer to note 16 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for information related to indemnification obligations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of june 30 2021 actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2021 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 9247 million these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of june 30 2021 the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by 96 million 

the fair market value of longterm fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as market interest rates fall and decrease as market interest rates rise as of june 30 2021 the fair value and the book value of our senior notes were 398 billion and 342 billion respectively due in various fiscal years ranging from 2024 to 2050 the interest expense for the 2014 senior notes was subject to interest rate adjustments following a downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies in february 2020 sp upgraded its credit rating of the company to “bbb” and revised its outlook to stable which permanently removed interest rate adjustments and the interest rate on the 2014 senior notes became fixed unlike the 2014 senior notes the interest rates for each series of the 2020 senior notes and 2019 senior notes are not subject to such adjustments 

in november 2017 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” for a 7500 million fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” which replaced our prior credit agreement subject to the terms of the credit agreement the revolving credit facility may be increased by an amount up to 2500 million in the aggregate in november 2018 we entered into an incremental facility extension and amendment agreement the “amendment” which amends the credit agreement to a extend the maturity date from november 30 2022 to november 30 2023 b increase the total commitment by 2500 million and c effect certain other amendments to the credit agreement as set forth in the amendment after giving effect to the amendment the total commitments under the credit agreement amount to 100 billion as of june 30 2021 we had no outstanding aggregate principal borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of june 30 2020 we elected to pay interest on the borrowed amount under the revolving credit facility at the libor plus a spread the spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the adjusted credit rating the fair value of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility is subject to interest rate risk only to the extent of the fixed spread portion of the interest rates which does not fluctuate with changes in interest rates we are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 10 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility which is subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades the annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility depending upon the theneffective credit rating additionally as of june 30 2021 if our credit ratings were downgraded to be below investment grade the maximum potential increase to our annual commitment fee for the revolving credit facility using the highest range of the ranges discussed above is estimated to be approximately 1 million 

our equity investment in a publicly traded company is subject to market price risk which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities as of june 30 2021 the fair value of our investment in the marketable equity security which begun publicly trading on the tokyo stock exchange on april 5 2021 was 299 million assuming a decline of 50 in market prices the aggregate value of our investment in the marketable equity security could decrease by approximately 15 million based on the value as of june 30 2021 

see note 5 “marketable securities” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “liquidity and capital resources” in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 and risk factors in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of june 30 2021 

as of june 30 2021 we had net forward and option contracts to sell 2035 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures see note 17 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to our consolidated financial statements for additional details if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2021 the us dollar equivalent would have been 1980 million a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 545 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our results of operations or cash flows

definition of disclosure controls 

disclosure controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act such as this report is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls include components of our internal control over financial reporting which consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states to the extent that components of our internal control over financial reporting are included within our disclosure controls they are included in the scope of our annual controls evaluation 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our ceo and cfo we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in internal control—integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2021 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2021 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

industry 

general background 

kla’s core focus is the semiconductor industry the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is typically 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is highly sophisticated and involves the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them 

out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish other more specialized wafers such as epitaxial silicon “epi” silicon on insulator “soi” gallium nitride “gan” and silicon carbide “sic” are also common in the semiconductor industry 

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times the majority of chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions and the upper “interconnect” structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality the wafer is then cut into individual chips and the chips that pass functional testing are packaged final testing is performed on all packaged chips packaged chips are then mounted onto pcbs for connection to the rest of the electronic system additionally flat panel displays are manufactured using processes similar to ics eg film deposition photolithography etching except using glass as the starting substrate 

the semiconductor equipment industry is currently experiencing multiple growth drivers bolstered by demand for chips from leading edge foundry and logic manufacturers to support computational power and connectivity for markets such as artificial intelligence “ai” and 5g wireless technology growth of the virtual interaction driven by covid19 related travel restrictions and quarantines as well as work from home requirements advances in healthcare and industrial application together with the increasing adoption of electrical vehicles and intelligence in automobiles are powering leadingedge node technology investments and capacity expansions intertwined in these areas spurred by the requirements of big data is the growth in demand for memory chips finally china continues to emerge as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ics government initiatives are propelling china to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity china is currently seen as an important longterm growth region for the semiconductor capital equipment sector 

the semiconductor industry continually introduces numerous technology changes to support this multisegmented market growth kla’s inspection metrology and data analytics technologies play key roles in enabling our customers to develop and manufacture advanced semiconductor devices to support and innovate around these trends 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to highvolume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies some requiring new substrate and film materials new geometries advanced multipatterning and euv lithography and advanced packaging techniques while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected the adoption of these technologies into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects and device performance characteristics namely speed capacity or power management become more sensitive to parameters such as linewidth and film thickness variation new process materials such as photoresists for euv lithography require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face 

the continuing evolution of semiconductors to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost well above 1000 billion substantially more than previousgeneration facilities in addition chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment 

by developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption and production of these new technologies at scale kla enables customers to better leverage increasingly expensive facilities and improve return on investment “roi” once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume kla’s systems monitor to ensure yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution in addition each new generation’s smaller design rules coupled with new materials and device innovation increased inprocess variability which requires a subsequent increase in inspection and metrology sampling 

kla systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer reticle and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so they can identify and address the underlying process 

problems the ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables kla customers to improve control over the manufacturing processes increasing their yield of highperformance parts and delivering products to market faster—thus maximizing profits with a broad portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and dedicated yield technology expertise kla is in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ nextgeneration products kla helps customers respond to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architectures more demanding lithography processes and new packaging techniques 

kla’s spts group a semiconductor processing business from the orbotech acquisition develops and sells differentiated custom deposition and etching solutions for fastgrowing markets such as power and analog devices rf communication chips and mems these devices which are often built on nontraditional substrates like sic and gan have become critical to accelerating some of the secular trends in automotive industrial and communication industries infrastructure buildout for 5g creates demand for rf components new sic and gan based power devices are moving into volume production for electric vehicles and highdensity packaging is growing to support ai 

kla provides a comprehensive portfolio of pcb tools services and solutions to accelerate technology transitions and production ramp our portfolio includes inline inspection tools to monitor the quality of printed circuit board fabrication equipment to repair defective boards digital imaging technologies to print fine geometry according to the design and computer aided manufacturing “cam” software growth in the pcb business is driven mainly by investments in 5g technology and its supporting applications smartphones autonomous vehicles ai and cloud servershigh performance computing these applications will be based on several technological segments including flexible printed circuits “fpcs” high density interconnect “hdi” pcbs and ic substrates 

kla also provides complete yield management solutions for the fpd market including automated optical inspection systems repair technologies and electrical testers an accelerated transition to organic light emitting diode “oled” displays to serve the mobile market introduction of oled technology for large size tvs and a steep ramp in liquid crystal display “lcd” production for televisions in china are driving the flat panel display business new technologies such as microled represent a growth opportunity for kla in the display market

pcb display and component inspection 

printed circuit board manufacturing 

pcbs are the basic interconnect platforms for the electronic components that comprise all electronic equipment an assembly of one or more pcbs on which desired components have been mounted forms an essential part of most electronic products pcbs are manufactured in a series of complex steps generally starting with a sheet of epoxyfiberglass or other material with electric insulating qualities laminated with a conducting material such as copper the conductor pattern is subsequently transferred to a photoimageable layer which is coated over the conductive layer substrate either through a direct imaging “di” or masked based photolithographic process followed by a chemical development and etching removal process of excess conducting material leaving the desired conducting metal pattern printed on the layer 

because of the complexity of each step in the process of pcb manufacturing sophisticated equipment is required in order to enable manufacturing especially of high complexity boards where high accuracy is required dimensions of pcb boards change during the manufacturing process and digital printing is required in order to compensate for these changes and meet demand for high accuracy pcbs are susceptible to various defects electrical shorts open circuits and insufficient or offmeasure conductor widths inspection is required throughout pcb production to identify such defects which are then repaired if possible early detection of these defects increases the possibility of successful repair and reduces the number of unusable boards thereby reducing the overall cost to the manufacturer early detection and repair are particularly valuable in cases of multilayered and ‘buildup’ boards wherein pcb layers are embedded inside the finished board 

kla’s orbotech subsidiary manufactures several solutions intended for use by manufacturers of pcbs to streamline and increase the efficiency and yield of pcb production 

  direct imaging “di” 

direct imaging technology enables the manufacture of higher density more complex pcbs with significantly higher yields and reduced manufacturing costs through the elimination of artwork costs and the scrap created by contact printing the di involves the transfer of digital image data directly from the electronic media onto the photoresist or solder resist thereby eliminating the need for exposing photoresist through a production photolithography tool this process translates into fewer manufacturing steps lower material costs and greater accuracy of layertolayer registration enabling designs with higher density and miniaturization at high yield 

orbotech’s direct imaging di solutions include the nuvogo series the paragonultra series and the orbotech diamond series nuvogo is an advanced di series for substratelike pcb “slp” modified semiadditive process “msap” advanced highdensity interconnect “hdi” and flex rigidflex and advanced multilayer boards “mlb” pcb mass production the paragonultra series serves complex applications including flip chip ball grid array “fcbga” flip chipchip scale package “fccsp” and other bga and csp substrates orbotech diamond is a high capacity high throughput di series for a wide variety of solder mask applications

automated optical shaping “aos” 

aos solutions are designed to address certain limitations inherent in the manual repair of pcbs by enabling the automatic shaping of defects in pcb production such defects include excess copper causing electrical shorts and missing copper causing electrical opens efficient shaping can reduce the scrapping of unusable panels during the manufacturing process enabling a significant reduction in manufacturers’ overall manufacturing costs orbotech aos solutions ablate the excess conductor material or add copper where missing and are commonly used for advanced pcbs where manual repair is not practical 

orbotech’s precise series is an automated solution for shaping both open and shorts defects for increasingly fine linespace circuitry the perfix series addresses excess copper defects for advanced ic substrates fine line applications slpmsap advanced flex applications and complex hdi and mlb manufacturing 

inkjetadditive printing

product table 







customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout asia the united states and europe staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor semiconductorrelated and electronic device manufacturers in each of these regions 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2020 2019 and 2018 the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues primarily in semiconductor process control segment 



our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor semiconductorrelated and electronic device manufacturers which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ics products utilizing ics and other electronic components we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it has historically been cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor semiconductorrelated and electronic device manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor or other industries in which we operate or slowdowns in the worldwide economy as well as customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are aimed at building deep longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing comprehensive resources for the full breadth of process control processenabling and yield management solutions for manufacturing and testing wafers and reticles integrated circuits packaging light emitting diodes power devices compound semiconductor devices microelectromechanical systems data storage printed circuit boards and flat and flexible panel displays as well as general materials research our customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility which are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier for multiple products and services our revenues are derived primarily from product sales and related service contracts mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in asia the united states and europe we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2020 we employed approximately 4020 fulltime sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of subsidiaries or branches in other countries including china germany israel united kingdom japan singapore korea and taiwan international revenues accounted for approximately 89 87 and 88 of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended june 30 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 19 “segment reporting and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in nonus dollar product sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in item 1a “risk factors” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our backlog which represents our performance obligation to deliver products and services totaled 213 billion and 184 billion as of june 30 2020 and 2019 respectively and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received and a majority of the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months orders for service contracts and unreleased products are included in the backlog all orders are subject to risk of delays pushouts and cancellation by the customer usually with limited or no penalties 

because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods the historical cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between on the one hand our ability to manufacture deliver and install products and on the other the requirements of our customers in our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources management of our operating model and other factors we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries and installations of products which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products 

research and development 

the market for semiconductor and electronics industries is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs in addition we may enter certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby certain government agencies or other third parties fund a portion of our research and development costs as of june 30 2020 we employed approximately 2870 fulltime research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 involved the development of process control and processenabling solutions for a broad range of industries including semiconductors printed circuit boards and displays for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product research and development even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to enhance our competitive position new product introductions however may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products and if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in the united states singapore israel germany united kingdom italy and china as of june 30 2020 we employed approximately 1830 fulltime manufacturing personnel 

some critical parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications while other parts are standard commercial products we use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers through our business interruption planning we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by among other things monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources or disruptions within our suppliers’ oftencomplex supply chains could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for technologically advanced process control processenabling and yield management solutions used by semiconductor and electronics manufactures is highly competitive in each of our product markets we have many competitors including companies such as applied materials inc asml holding nv hitachi hightechnologies corporation onto innovation inc and lasertec inc some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated capabilities into their existing development and manufacturing processes to enhance productivity significant competitive factors in the market for process control and processenabling systems include system performance ease of use reliability interoperability with the existing installed base and technical service and support as well as overall cost of ownership 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions and alliances 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business no single patent copyright or trade secret is essential to us as a whole or to any of our business segments 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment including without limitation the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial condition results of operations or competitive position 

however any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of june 30 2020 we employed approximately 10600 fulltime employees except for our employees in belgium where a trade union delegation has been recognized and our employees in the german operations of our mie business unit who are represented by employee works council none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees

 item 1a risk factors 

a description of factors that could materially affect our business financial condition or operating results is provided below 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the current covid19 pandemic and the potential aftereffects from it could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations  

the covid19 pandemic has caused substantial global disruptions including in the jurisdictions where we conduct business and may cause additional disruptions in the future which are impossible to predict local regional and national authorities in numerous jurisdictions have implemented a variety of measures designed to slow the spread of the virus including social distancing guidelines quarantines banning of nonessential travel and requiring the cessation of nonessential activities on the premises of businesses 

some of the risks associated with the pandemic or a worsening of the pandemic in the future include 

• cancellation or reduction of routes available from common carriers which may cause delays in our ability to deliver or service our products or receive components from suppliers necessary to manufacture or service our products 

• travel bans or the requirement to quarantine for a lengthy period after entering a jurisdiction which may delay our ability to install the products we sell or service those products following installation 

• governmental orders or employee exposure requiring us our customers or our suppliers to discontinue manufacturing products at our respective facilities for a period of time 

• reduced demand for our products pushout of deliveries or cancellation of orders by our customers caused by a global recession resulting from the pandemic and the measures implemented by authorities to slow the spread of covid19 

• increased costs or inability to acquire components necessary for the manufacture of our products due to reduced availability 

• absence of liquidity at customers and suppliers caused by disruptions from the pandemic which may hamper the ability of customers to pay for the products they purchase on time or at all or hamper the ability of our suppliers to continue to supply components to us in a timely manner or at all and 

• loss of efficiencies due to remote working requirements for our employees 

if any of the foregoing risks occur or intensify during this pandemic our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

risks associated with our industry 

ongoing changes in the technology industry as well as the semiconductor industry in particular could expose our business to significant risks 

the industries that we serve including the semiconductor flat panel display and printed circuit board industries are constantly developing and changing over time many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve pricing trends in the endmarkets for consumer electronics and other products which place a growing emphasis on our customers’ cost of ownership changes in our customers’ capital spending patterns and in general an environment of constant change and development including decreasing product and component dimensions use of new materials and increasingly complex device structures applications and process steps if we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends or with respect to technological advances if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry as a significant majority of our sales are our process control and yield management products sold to semiconductor manufacturers some of the trends that our management monitors in operating our business include the following 

• the potential for reversal of the longterm historical trend of declining cost per transistor with each new generation of technological advancement within the semiconductor industry and the adverse impact that such reversal may have upon our business 

• the increasing cost of building and operating fabrication facilities and the impact of such increases on our customers’ capital equipment investment decisions 

• differing market growth rates and capital requirements for different applications such as memory logic and foundry 

• lower level of process control adoption by our memory customers compared to our foundry and logic customers 

• our customers’ reuse of existing and installed products which may decrease their need to purchase new products or solutions at more advanced technology nodes 

• the emergence of disruptive technologies that change the prevailing semiconductor manufacturing processes or the economics associated with semiconductor manufacturing and as a result also impact the inspection and metrology requirements associated with such processes 

• the higher design costs for the most advanced integrated circuits which could economically constrain leadingedge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications 

• the possible introduction of integrated products by our larger competitors that offer inspection and metrology functionality in addition to managing other semiconductor manufacturing processes 

• changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes that are extremely costly for our customers to implement and accordingly our customers could reduce their available budgets for process control equipment by reducing inspection and metrology sampling rates for certain technologies 

• the bifurcation of the semiconductor manufacturing industry into a leading edge manufacturers driving continued research and development into nextgeneration products and technologies and b other manufacturers that are content with existing including previous generation products and technologies 

• the everescalating cost of nextgeneration product development which may result in joint development programs between us and our customers or government entities to help fund such programs that could restrict our control of ownership of and profitability from the products and technologies developed through those programs and 

• the entry by some semiconductor manufacturers into collaboration or sharing arrangements for capacity cost or risk with other manufacturers as well as increased outsourcing of their manufacturing activities and greater focus only on specific markets or applications whether in response to adverse market conditions or other market pressures 

any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers’ rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce which could result in downward pressure on our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been highly concentrated due to corporate consolidation acquisitions and business closures in this environment orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales this increasing concentration exposes our business financial condition and operating results to a number of risks including the following 

• the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year which exposes our business and operating results to increased volatility tied to individual customers 

• new orders from our foundry customers in the past several years have constituted a significant portion of our total orders this concentration increases the impact that future business or technology changes within the foundry industry may have on our business financial condition and operating results 

• in a highly concentrated business environment if a particular customer does not place an order or if they delay or cancel orders we may not be able to replace the business furthermore because our process control and yield management products are configured to each customer’s specifications any changes delays or cancellations of orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs 

• as a result of this consolidation the customers that survive the consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales and consequently have greater commercial negotiating leverage many of our large customers have more aggressive policies regarding engaging alternative secondsource suppliers for the products we offer and in addition may seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that may have an adverse impact on our business any of these changes could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins 

• certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes created alliances with other companies experienced management changes or have outsourced manufacturing activities any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions any future change in ownership or management of our existing customers may result in similar challenges including the possibility of the successor entity or new management deciding to select a competitor’s products 

• the highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers for example as a result of the challenging economic environment during fiscal year 2009 we were and in some cases continue to be exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial viability of certain of our customers to the extent our customers experience liquidity issues in the future we may be required to incur additional bad debt expense with respect to receivables owed to us by those customers in addition customers with liquidity issues may be forced to reduce purchases of our equipment delay deliveries of our products discontinue operations or may be acquired by one of our customers and in either case such event would have the effect of further consolidating our customer base 

• semiconductor manufacturers generally must commit significant resources to qualify install and integrate process control and yield management equipment into a semiconductor production line we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s process control and yield management equipment the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time accordingly we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for that specific production line application and other similar production line applications if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment similarly we expect it to be challenging for a competitor to sell its products to a given customer for a specific production line application if that customer initially selects our equipment 

• prices differ among the products we offer for different applications due to differences in features offered or manufacturing costs if there is a shift in demand by our customers from our higherpriced to lowerpriced products our gross margin and revenue would decrease in addition when products are initially introduced they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation which can impact gross margin 

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we operate in industries that have historically been cyclical including the semiconductor industry the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the condition of the industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the industries in which we serve are difficult to predict the historically cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry in which we primarily operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization consumer demand for products inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in or cancellation or delay of orders which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customer’s funding status which could be weakened not only by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or companyspecific reasons but also by funding limitations imposed by the customer’s unique organizational structure any of these factors could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results then our business could be seriously harmed furthermore any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

in addition our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics which when made are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time however largely due to the historical cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles our actual results may vary and have varied in the past from forecasted results these variations can occur for any number of reasons including but not limited to unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders product shipments or product acceptance an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to adapt to changing business conditions or a different than anticipated effective tax rate the impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment this is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues but also due to the 

advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order to meet the expected lead times to significant inventory writeoffs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided we provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of management’s expectations for the future but those reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of and are themselves forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this item 1a and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements if our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts or if we revise our forecasts the market price of our common stock could decline 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the industries in which we serve including the semiconductor flat panel display and printed circuit board industries depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver appears to be slowing which may cause semiconductor manufacturers to delay investments in equipment investigate more complex device architectures use new materials and develop innovative fabrication processes these and other evolving customer plans and needs require us to respond with continued development programs and cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards develop and introduce new products and solutions that successfully address changing customer needs win market acceptance of these new products and solutions and manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner our failure to accurately predict evolving industry standards and develop as well as offer competitive technology solutions in a timely manner with costeffective products could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance features and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

in addition the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks we regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer even before receiving the customer’s formal acceptance of that product in certain situations including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted however our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents all of which must perform to their respective specifications so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall product’s required specifications in such a situation the customer may be entitled to certain remedies which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and as a result our stock price 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of inspection products as a result any delay or reduction of sales of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results the continued customer demand for these products and the development introduction and market acceptance of new products and technologies are critical to our future success 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or 

commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own which may adversely affect our business in addition we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects the termination of any such collaboration or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration could significantly impair our research and development efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of continuing significant investments in product research and development however we may enter new markets whether through acquisitions or new internal product development in which competition is based primarily on product pricing not technological superiority further some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing through our business interruption planning we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by among other things monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers certain key parts are available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers also key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers’ proprietary intellectual property in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for highperformance hightechnology components which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products in addition if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations which is a heightened risk especially during economic downturns it could affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products similarly especially with respect to suppliers of hightechnology components our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in a timely manner and result in delays for our products our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our 

production requirements and product specifications or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms furthermore a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons including the supplier’s financial condition or business operational decisions which would require us to purchase in a single transaction a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers such “endoflife” parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory writeoff either of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods 

if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan our operating results business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted 

we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually revised frequently generally quarterly and reviewed by management even more frequently at least monthly our business plan is developed based on a number of factors many of which require estimates and assumptions such as our expectations of the economic environment future business levels our customers’ willingness and ability to place orders leadtimes and future revenue and cash flow our budgeted operating expenses for example are based in part on our future revenue expectations however our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors including the volatile and historically cyclical nature of our primary industry customer order cancellations macroeconomic changes operational matters regarding particular agreements our ability to manage customer deliveries the availability of resources for the installation of our products delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a 

because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results similarly if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period which would also negatively affect our results of operations if we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted such an outcome could cause customers suppliers or investors to view us as less stable or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates any of which could have an adverse impact on our stock price 

in addition our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources the need to manage our operating model and other factors in furtherance of those efforts we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries installations and payment scheduling any such decisions may impact our ability to recognize revenue including the fiscal period during which such revenue may be recognized with respect to such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or stock price 

we have a leveraged capital structure 

as of june 30 2020 we had 350 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness consisting of 345 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes and 500 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility and an additional 9500 million in unfunded commitments we may incur additional indebtedness in the future by accessing the unfunded portion of our revolving credit facility andor entering into new financing arrangements for example at the same time we announced our intention to acquire orbotech we also announced a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase up to 300 billion of our common stock a large portion of which would be financed with new indebtedness our ability to pay interest and repay the principal of our current indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations our credit rating the ongoing interest rate environment and the other risk factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of notes by at least two of moody’s sp and fitch inc unless we have exercised our right to redeem the notes of such series we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or at the holder’s option any part of each holder’s notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below the “change of control offer” in the change of control offer we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any on the notes repurchased up to but not including the date of repurchase we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of that series of notes our ability to repurchase that series of notes in such event may be limited by law by the indenture associated with that series of notes or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time if we fail to repurchase that series of notes as 

required by the terms of such notes it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing that series of notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate and an increase in interest rates would require us to pay additional interest on any borrowings which may have an adverse effect on the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline the interest rate under our revolving credit facility is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades additionally under our revolving credit facility we are required to comply with affirmative and negative covenants which include the maintenance of certain financial ratios the details of which can be found in note 8 “debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

if we fail to comply with these covenants we will be in default and our borrowings will become immediately due and payable there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time in addition certain of our domestic subsidiaries are required to guarantee our borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the event that we default on our borrowings these domestic subsidiaries shall be liable for our borrowings which could disrupt our operations and result in a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

our leveraged capital structure may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and net income per share 

our issuance and maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to 

• a negative impact on our ability to satisfy our future obligations 

• an increase in the portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to increased interest and principal payments that may not be available for operations working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments dividends stock repurchases general corporate or other purposes 

• an impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and 

• obligations to comply with restrictive and financial covenants as noted in the above risk factor and note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

our ability to satisfy our future expenses as well as our new debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our future operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our future expenses and service our new debt obligations which may impact our ability to manage our capital structure to preserve and maintain our investment grade rating if our future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows we may need to access the money available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility or enter into new financing arrangements to obtain necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms any borrowings under our revolving credit facility will place further pressure on us to comply with the financial covenants if we fail to make a payment associated with our debt obligations we could be in default on such debt and such a default could cause us to be in default on our other obligations 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors first instituted a quarterly dividend during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 since that time we have announced a number of increases in the amount of our quarterly dividend level as well as payment of a special cash dividend that was declared and substantially paid in the second quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30 2015 we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends may be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws changes to our business model and our increased interest and principal payments required by our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions including our indemnification of third parties as well as the performance of our products 

although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties costly and timeconsuming litigation or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes or could impact our revenue or cost recognition any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in our commercial agreements from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers suppliers and lessors with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes in addition notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations whether or not asserted due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects especially when products are first introduced unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us including increased service or warranty costs providing product replacements for or modifications to defective products litigation related to defective products reimbursement for damages caused by our products product recalls or product writeoffs or disposal costs these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business financial condition and operating results in addition our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

furthermore we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives such as credits toward future purchases we believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our longterm business as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase higher volumes of our products however these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives our volume purchase agreements require significant estimation for the amounts to be accrued depending upon the estimate of volume of future purchases as such we are required to update our estimates of the accruals on a periodic basis until the earnings process is complete our estimates could differ in comparison to actual results as a result these volume purchase arrangements while expected to be beneficial to our business over time could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in nearterm periods including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and therefore our gross margins 

in addition we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customerspecific commitments on pricing tool reliability spare parts stocking levels response time and other commitments furthermore we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection to date we have made no significant accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in supporting an audit or inspection or defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

there are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development 

we are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies both domestically and internationally governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion or a project may be terminated by mutual agreement if the parties determine that the project’s goals or milestones are not being achieved so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future in addition under the terms of these government grants the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur directly and indirectly in connection with such programs any such audit could result in modifications to or even termination of the applicable government funding program for example if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program those costs would not be reimbursed and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded we do not know the outcome of any future audits any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties financial or otherwise termination of funding programs suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency any of which could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations 

historically we have recorded material restructuring charges related to our prior global workforce reductions large excess inventory writeoffs and material impairment charges related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans or do so within the expected time frame if we again restructure our organization and business processes implement additional cost reduction actions or discontinue certain business operations we may take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to among other things employee terminations or exit costs we may also be required to writeoff additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline also as our lead times from suppliers increase due to the increasing complexity of the parts and components they provide and the lead times demanded by our customers decrease due to the time pressures they face when introducing new products or technology or bringing new facilities into production we may be compelled to increase our commitments and therefore our risk exposure to inventory purchases to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner and that inventory may need to be writtenoff if demand for the underlying product declines for any reason such additional writeoffs could result in material charges 

we have recorded material charges related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives based on economic benefit if known or using the straightline method and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for longlived assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including but not limited to declines in our operating cash flows declines in our stock price or market capitalization declines in our market share and declines in revenues or profits a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and as applicable the amount of any previous impairment charge could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge 

any such additional material charges whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements 

we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements 

we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions any of which may prove not to be financially viable if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables however by entering into these arrangements and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services we are exposed to additional risks if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered 

in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws if we were to violate any such law we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general commercial operational financial and regulatory risks 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges including but not limited to 

• global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses trade sanctions tariffs and international trade disputes 

• political and social attitudes laws rules regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over nondomestic companies including customer or governmentsupported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors 

• ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries 

• managing cultural diversity and organizational alignment 

• exposure to the unique characteristics of each region in the global market which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period 

• periodic local or international economic downturns 

• potential adverse tax consequences including withholding tax rules that may limit the repatriation of our earnings and higher effective income tax rates in foreign countries where we do business 

• compliance with customs regulations in the countries in which we do business 

• existing and potentially new tariffs or other trade restrictions and barriers including those applied to our products spare parts and services or to parts and supplies that we purchase 

• political instability natural disasters legal or regulatory changes acts of war or terrorism in regions where we have operations or where we do business 

• fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may adversely impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business although we attempt to manage some of our nearterm currency risks through the use of hedging instruments there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate 

• receiving prepayments for certain of our products and services sold in certain jurisdictions these prepayments increase our cash flows for the quarter in which they are received if our practice of requiring prepayments in those jurisdictions changes or deteriorates our cash flows would be harmed 

• longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable outside of the united states 

• difficulties in managing foreign distributors including monitoring and ensuring our distributors’ compliance with applicable laws and 

• inadequate protection or enforcement of our intellectual property and other legal rights in foreign jurisdictions 

in addition government controls either by the united states or other countries that restrict our business overseas or restrict our ability to import or export our products and services or increase the cost of our operations through the imposition of tariffs new controls outright bans or otherwise could harm our business for example the united states department of commerce has added numerous chinabased entities to the us entity list including fujian jinhua integrated circuit company ltd “jhicc” and certain huawei entities  restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without a license in addition the us department of commerce has imposed new export licensing requirements on chinabased customers engaged in military end uses as well as requiring our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on us technology to manufacture custom products for huawei or its affiliates 

to date these new rules have not significantly impacted our operations but we are continually monitoring their impact similar actions by the us government or another country could impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers 

any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy 

demand for our products is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending which caused our customers to decrease cancel or delay their equipment and service orders from us in the economic slowdown during fiscal year 2009 in addition the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell reduced demand combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of such financing has at times in the past adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels 

in addition a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and where applicable credit ratings of such investments a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity if the market value of such investments were to decline or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

we might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property or other confidential information that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the industries in which we serve from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information in addition we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties with respect to intellectual property infringement disputes our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however there can be no assurance that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition furthermore we may potentially be subject to claims by customers suppliers or other business partners or by governmental law enforcement agencies related to our receipt distribution andor use of thirdparty intellectual property or confidential information legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit and associated internal investigations with respect to intellectual property or confidential information disputes are often expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert management’s attention and other company resources andor may result in restrictions on our ability to sell our products settlements on significantly adverse terms or adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines any of which could have a significant negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings claims or investigations the instigation of legal proceedings or claims our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims or the determination of any adverse findings against us or any of our employees in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our business reputation 

we are exposed to various risks related to the legal regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to compliance with new existing different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust anticorruptionantibribery unclaimed property and export control regulations our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws rules or regulations or changes to existing laws rules or regulations including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business from time to time we may receive inquiries or audit notices from governmental or regulatory bodies or we may participate in voluntary disclosure programs related to legal regulatory or tax compliance matters and these inquiries notices or programs may result in significant financial cost including investigation expenses defense costs assessments and penalties reputational harm and other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations including those that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental regulations including regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute potentially more expensive andor rarer materials further we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by any release regardless of fault we also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the materials composition of our products including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources of certain metals and other materials the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business 

in addition we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment immigration contracts product performance product liability antitrust environmental regulations securities unfair competition and other matters these legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit our ability to sell our products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims which could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel in addition current or future immigration laws policies or regulations may limit our ability to attract hire and retain qualified personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our current and future needs our business and operations could be harmed 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation information systems management and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting and procurement functions to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations in addition many of these outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage employ cloud computing technology for such storage these providers’ cloud computing systems may be susceptible to “cyber incidents” such as intentional cyberattacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cybersecurity compromises which are outside of our control if we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely 

obtained if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as anticipated or do not adequately protect our data from cyberrelated security breaches or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes we may experience operational difficulties such as limitations on our ability to ship products increased costs manufacturing or service interruptions or delays loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data quality and compliance issues and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and cyber incidents 

in the conduct of our business we collect use transmit and store data on information systems this data includes confidential information transactional information and intellectual property belonging to us our customers and our business partners as well as personallyidentifiable information of individuals we allocate significant resources to network security data encryption and other measures to protect our information systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse despite our ongoing efforts to enhance our network security measures our information systems are susceptible to computer viruses cyberrelated security breaches and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions tampering misuse criminal acts including phishing or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate and are subject to the inherent vulnerabilities of network security measures we have experienced cyberrelated attacks in the past and may experience cyberrelated attacks in the future our security measures may also be breached due to employee errors malfeasance or otherwise third parties may also attempt to influence employees users suppliers or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our our customers’ or business partners’ data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to the information systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

any of such occurrences could result in disruptions to our operations misappropriation corruption or theft of confidential information including intellectual property and other critical data of kla our customers and other business partners misappropriation of funds and company assets reduced value of our investments in research development and engineering litigation with or payment of damages to third parties reputational damage costs to comply with regulatory inquiries or actions data privacy issues costs to rebuild our internal information systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs 

we carry insurance that provides some protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident but it will not likely cover all such losses and the losses that it does not cover may be significant 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact our business operations 

our global operations are dependent upon certain information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications system failures or malfunctioning such as difficulties with our customer relationship management “crm” system could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results our enterprise resource planning “erp” system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records record transactions provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems whether in connection with the regular operation periodic enhancements modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort in february 2019 we announced that we had consummated our acquisition of orbotech we may also enter into definitive agreements for and consummate acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses if the costs associated with integrating the acquired business exceeds our expectations or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than anticipated in addition we may lose key employees of the acquired companies as a result risks associated with acquisition transactions may lead to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons including 

• we may have to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to acquired businesses 

• the combination of businesses may result in the loss of key personnel or an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our company andor the acquired business 

• we may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from our acquisitions 

• we may experience challenges in entering into new market segments for which we have not previously manufactured and sold products 

• we may face difficulties in coordinating geographically separated organizations systems and facilities 

• the customers distributors suppliers employees and others with whom the companies we acquire have business dealings may have a potentially adverse reaction to the acquisition 

• we may have difficulty implementing a cohesive framework of internal controls over the entire organization 

• we may have to writeoff goodwill or other intangible assets and 

• we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions 

at times we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary highly sensitive information the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations or in the operations of our customers due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states singapore israel germany united kingdom italy and china in addition our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors as well as our other operations and those of our customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics and pandemics fire earthquake volcanic eruptions energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites we cannot provide any assurance that alternate means of conducting our operations whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if such alternate means were available they could be obtained on favorable terms 

in addition as part of our costcutting actions we have consolidated several operating facilities our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above such as acts of war or terrorism earthquakes fires or other natural disasters if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at or acts of war in the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the industries we serve could adversely affect our business increased international political instability in various parts of the world disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations we maintain significant operations in israel since the establishment of the state of israel in 1948 a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility varying in degree and intensity has led to security and economic challenges for israel in addition some our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and may be called to active military duty in emergency circumstances we cannot assess the impact that emergency conditions in israel in the future may have on our business operations financial condition or results of operations but it could be material instability in any region could directly impact 

our ability to operate our business or our customers’ ability to operate their businesses cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate instability in the region could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we selfinsure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain risks are uninsurable are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance accordingly we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds the applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy for example we do not currently hold earthquake insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations a significant portion of which are conducted in california an area highly susceptible to earthquakes it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products much of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we selfinsure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also selfinsured either based on a similar costbenefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the japanese yen the euro the pound sterling and the israeli new shekel we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally in addition an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the united states and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected furthermore if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge we may experience material financial losses 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments impairment of our investments could harm our earnings in addition we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that are susceptible to changes in market interest rates and bond yields as market interest rates and bond yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss we believe we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity however an impairment of the fair market value of our investments even if unrealized must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

in addition the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets our operating results or other performance metrics or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies 

we are exposed to risks in connection with tax and regulatory compliance audits in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits such as related to customs or product safety requirements in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes penalties fines or other prohibitions against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that our products and practices comply with applicable 

regulations the final determination of any such audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals related to income taxes and other contingencies in addition to and in connection with the israel tax authority “ita” assessment described in more detail in note 14 “income taxes” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements there is an ongoing criminal investigation against our orbotech subsidiary certain of its employees and its tax consultant that began prior to the acquisition date we can make no assurances that an indictment will not result from the criminal investigation the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

we earn profits in and are therefore potentially subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions including singapore israel and the cayman islands the countries in which we earn the majority of our nonus profits due to economic political or other conditions tax rates in those jurisdictions may be subject to significant change a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in the tax rates imposed by those jurisdictions expiration of tax holidays in certain jurisdictions that are not renewed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in stockbased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of earnings from outside the us for which we have not previously provided for us taxes a change in our effective tax rate can materially and adversely impact our results from operations 

in addition recent changes to us tax laws will significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings numerous countries are evaluating their existing tax laws due in part to recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd’s” base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project as of december 31 2018 we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the act which was enacted into law on december 22 2017 however the recent us tax law changes are subject to future guidance from us federal and state governments such as the treasury department andor the irs any future guidance can change our tax liability a significant portion of the income taxes due to the enactment of the act is payable by us over a period of eight years as a result our cash flows from operating activities will be adversely impacted until tax liability is paid in full 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements has become increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices or changes in interpretations of such standards practices or rules can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting standards and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future changes to or revised interpretations or applications of existing accounting standards or tax rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business adoption of new standards may require changes to our processes accounting systems and internal controls difficulties encountered during adoption could result in internal control deficiencies or delay the reporting of our financial results in addition the passing of the tax cuts and jobsact in december 2017 caused us to significantly increase our provision for income taxes which had a material adverse effect on our net income for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 further interpretations of the act from the government and regulatory organizations may change our tax expense provided for our transitional tax liability and deferred tax adjustments as well as our provision liability or accounting treatment of the provisional liability which may potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts

executive summary 

we are a global leader in process control and a supplier of processenabling solutions and services for the data era 

we are a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions and services for the semiconductor pcb and display markets our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products and related service software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process from research and development to final volume production we provide leading edge equipment software and services that enable ic manufacturers to identify resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost in addition to serving the semiconductor pcb and display industry we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries including advanced packaging light emitting diode  “ led ” power devices compound semiconductor and data storage industries as well as general materials research 

our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer ic lithography reticle “reticle” or “mask” and hard disk drive manufacturers around the world our products services and expertise are used by our customers to measure detect analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes 

our revenues are driven largely by our customers’ spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand or expansion plans our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets  memory foundry and logic all three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in enduser demand which influence the level and pattern of our customers’ spending on our products and services although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been cyclical the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics communications data processing and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions particularly in the foundry and logic markets which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market the data era is creating multiple drivers for growth with increased demand for advanced and lower cost chips for artificial intelligence ai 5g connectivity virtual interaction electric cars advanced driver assistance automotive systems adas internet of things iot and mobile devices 

the semiconductor and electronics industries have also been characterized by constant technological innovation we believe that over the long term our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications that fuel demand for process control equipment 

the demand for our products and our revenue levels are driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate advanced ics that are incorporated into sophisticated devices our customers continuously seek to increase yields and enhance the efficiency of their manufacturing processes including by improving their manufacturing inspection testing and repair capabilities 

the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years 1    



 

1 on february 20 2019 we completed the acquisition of orbotech for total consideration of approximately 326 billion the operating results of orbotech have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date for additional details refer to note 6 “business combinations” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

2 our net income attributable to kla for the year ended june 30 2020 includes a pretax goodwill impairment charge of 2566 million and a pretax charge of 225 million as a result of the extinguishment of debt for additional details refer to note 7 goodwill and purchased intangible assets and note 8 debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

impact of covid19 

events surrounding the ongoing covid19 pandemic have resulted in a reduction in economic activity across the globe the severity and duration of these economic repercussions remain largely unknown and ultimately will depend on many factors including the speed and effectiveness of the containment efforts throughout the world the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact demand for our products depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and very difficult to predict including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and actions to contain and treat its impacts while all of our global sites are currently operational our facilities could be required to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates 

from the start of the covid19 pandemic we proactively implemented preventative protocols intended to safeguard our employees contractors suppliers customers and communities and ensure business continuity in the event government restrictions or severe outbreaks impact our operations at certain sites we remain committed to the health and safety of our employees contractors suppliers customers and communities and are following government policies and recommendations designed to slow the spread of covid19 

our efforts to respond to the covid19 pandemic include the following 

• we have put health screenings in place required social distancing and have established employee separation protocols at our facilities we have also suspended nonessential business travel and require team members to work from home to the extent possible where work from home is not possible all onsite team members must pass through thermal scanning equipment to ensure they do not have an elevated body temperature and must wear a mask at all times 

• we have developed strategies to address our responsiveness and ability to send engineers into customer facilities to provide support services 

• we have evaluated our supply chain and communicated with our suppliers to identify supply gaps and taken steps to ensure continuity we continue to monitor the supply chain and work with our suppliers to identify and mitigate potential gaps to ensure continuity of supply 

• we are evaluating all our construction projects across our global operations and enacting protocols to enhance the safety of our employees suppliers and contractors 

• we have developed strategies and are implementing measures to respond to a variety of potential economic scenarios such as limitations on new hiring and reductions in discretionary spending 

• we are working with government authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate and continuing to monitor our operations in an effort to ensure we follow government requirements relevant regulations industry standards and best practices to help safeguard our team members while safely continuing operations to the extent possible at our sites across the globe 

we believe these actions are appropriate and prudent to safeguard our employees contractors suppliers customers and communities while allowing us to safely continue operations but we cannot predict how the steps we our team members government entities suppliers or customers take in response to the covid19 pandemic will impact our business outlook or results of operations 

we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and stakeholders or as required by federal state or local authorities the covid19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in freight costs due in large part to reduced air traffic which impacts gross margin as well as decreases in travel costs which reduce our cost structure as of the date of this report we cannot predict with certainty any other effects the covid19 pandemic may have on our business including the effects on our customers employees or on our financial results for the remainder of calendar 2020 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following 

revenue recognition we primarily derive revenue from the sale of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries maintenance and support of all these products installation and training services and the sale of spare parts our portfolio also includes yield enhancement and production solutions used by manufacturers of printed circuit boards flat panel displays advanced packaging microelectromechanical systems and other electronic components our solutions provide a comprehensive portfolio of inspection metrology and data analytics products which are accompanied by a flexible portfolio of services to enable our customers to maintain the performance and productivity of the solutions purchased our solutions are generally not sold with a right of return nor have we experienced significant returns from or refunds to our customers 

we account for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties the rights of the parties are identified payment terms are identified the contract has commercial substance and collectibility of consideration is probable our revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties such as sales taxes the revenues are recognized as separate performance obligations that are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to the customer our arrangements with our customers include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations a product or service is considered distinct if it is separately identifiable from other deliverables in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer the transaction consideration including any sales incentives is allocated between separate performance obligations of an arrangement based on the standalone selling prices “ssp” for each distinct product or service management considers a variety of factors to determine the ssp such as historical standalone sales of products and services discounting strategies and other observable data from time to time our contracts are modified to account for additional or to change existing performance obligations our contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively 

product revenue 

we recognize revenue from product sales at a point in time when we have satisfied our performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer we use judgment to evaluate whether the control has transferred by considering several indicators including 

• whether we have a present right to payment 

• the customer has legal title 

• the customer has physical possession 

• the customer has significant risk and rewards of ownership and 

• the customer has accepted the product or whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of similar products for example when the customer has previously accepted the same tool with the same specifications and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria and when the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory 

not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer in circumstances in which revenue is recognized prior to the product acceptance the portion of revenue associated with our performance obligations to install product is deferred and recognized upon acceptance 

we enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers we adjust the transaction consideration for estimated credits earned by our customers for such incentives these credits are estimated based upon the forecasted and actual product sales for any given period and agreedupon incentive rate the estimate is updated at each reporting period 

we offer perpetual and term licenses for software products the primary difference between perpetual and term licenses is the duration over which the customer can benefit from the use of the software while the functionality and the features of the software are the same software is generally bundled with postcontract customer support “pcs” which includes unspecified software updates that are made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement revenue from software licenses is recognized at a point in time when the software is made available to the customer revenue from pcs is deferred at contract inception and recognized ratably over the service period or as services are performed 

services and spare parts revenue 

the majority of product sales include a standard 6 to 12month warranty that is not separately paid for by the customers the customers may also purchase extended warranty for periods beyond the initial year as part of the initial product sale we have concluded that the standard 12month warranty as well as any extended warranty periods included in the initial product sales are separate performance obligations for most of our products the estimated fair value of warranty services is deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the warranty period as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of warranty services provided by us 

additionally we offer product maintenance and support services which the customer may purchase separately from the standard and extended warranty offered as part of the initial product sale revenue from separately negotiated maintenance and support service contracts is also recognized over time based on the terms of the applicable service period revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract including training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed we also sell spare parts revenue from which is recognized when control over the spare parts is transferred to the customer 

installation services include connecting and validating configuration of the product in addition several testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to customer specifications revenues from product installation are deferred and recognized at a point in time once installation is complete 

significant judgments 

our contracts with our customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services each product and service is generally capable of being distinct within the context of the contract and represents a separate performance obligation determining the ssp for each distinct performance obligation and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements we typically estimate the ssp of products and services based on observable transactions when the products and services are sold on a standalone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable range we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of these products by customers and circumstances in these instances we use information such as the size of the customer geographic region as well as customization of the products in determining the ssp in instances where the ssp is not directly observable we determine the ssp using information that includes market conditions entityspecific factors including discounting strategies information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs while changes in the allocation of ssp between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular contract any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and result of operations 

although the products are generally not sold with a right of return we may provide other credits or sales incentives which are accounted for either as variable consideration or material right depending on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement these credits and incentives are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if and when additional information becomes available 

as outlined above we use judgments to evaluate whether or not the customer has obtained control of the product and considers the several indicators in evaluating whether or not control has transferred to the customer not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer 

contract assetsliabilities 

the timing of revenue recognition billings and cash collections may result in accounts receivable contract assets and contract liabilities deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets a receivable is recorded in the period we deliver products or provide services when we have an unconditional right to payment contract assets primarily relate to the value of 

products and services transferred to the customer for which the right to payment is not just dependent on the passage of time contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when rights to payment become unconditional 

a contract liability is recognized when we receive payment or have an unconditional right to payment in advance of the satisfaction of performance the contract liabilities represent 1 deferred product revenue related to the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers and for which the control has not been transferred to the customers and 2 deferred service revenue which is recorded when we receive consideration or such consideration is unconditionally due from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a contract deferred service revenue typically results from warranty services and maintenance and other service contracts 

contract assets and liabilities related to rights and obligations in a contract are recorded net in the consolidated balance sheets 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales customer contracts and acquired technologies expected costs to develop inprocess research and development into commercially viable products estimated cash flows from the projects when completed including assumptions associated with the technology migration curve estimated royalty rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets and discount rates the discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired including inprocess research and development “iprd” based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which will not exceed one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 

the fair value of iprd is initially capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the iprd assets may not be recoverable impairment of iprd is recorded to research and development expenses when an iprd project is completed the iprd is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized to costs of revenues over the asset’s estimated useful life 

acquisitionrelated expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or net realizable value net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value we review and set standard costs semiannually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of 

which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to record additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

accounting for stockbased compensation plans we account for sharebased awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors compensation expense for restricted stock units with performance metrics is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant or when a grant contains a market condition the grant date fair value using a monte carlo simulation the monte carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions including the award’s expected life the price volatility of the underlying stock as well as the potential outcomes of the market condition on the grant date of each award 

contingencies and litigation we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs incurred to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see note 16 “commitments and contingencies” and note 15 “litigation and other legal matters” to our consolidated financial statements for additional details 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets  impairment assessments we review goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable pursuant to the authoritative guidance we make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to those reporting units which determines the carrying values for each reporting unit when assessing goodwill for impairment an initial assessment of qualitative factors determines whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value judgments related to qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance relevant entityspecific events a sustained decrease in share price and other events affecting the reporting units if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value including goodwill if the former is lower goodwill is written down by the excess amount limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit see note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the market approach when deemed appropriate and the necessary information is available or the income approach which uses discounted cash flow dcf analysis or a combination of both if multiple valuation methodologies are used the results are weighted determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including judgments about appropriate discount rates revenue growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity plus a risk premium the wacc used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts the market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies 

we review purchased finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of the assets are no longer appropriate we determine whether finitelived intangible assets are recoverable based on the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowestlevel associated asset grouping assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective if the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the longlived assets carrying value we recognize an impairment loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable the authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill it allows the option to first assess qualitative factors events and circumstances that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset the qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is morelikelythannot that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinitelived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to 

calculating its fair value our indefinitelived intangible assets are inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets 

any impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and net asset value in the quarter in which we recognize the impairment charge see note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires income tax effects for changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which the law is enacted 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

we record income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us our effective tax rate would be adversely affected if we change our intent or if such undistributed earnings are needed for us operations because we would be required to provide or pay income taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings 

global intangible lowtaxed income the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” includes provisions for global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations this income will effectively be taxed at a 105 tax rate in general as a result our deferred tax assets and liabilities were being evaluated to determine if the deferred tax assets and liabilities should be recognized for the basis differences expected to reverse as a result of gilti provisions that are effective for us after the fiscal year ending june 30 2018 or should the tax on gilti provisions be recognized as period costs in each year incurred we elected to account for gilti as a component of current period tax expense starting from the first quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30 2019 

valuation of marketable securities our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration of the investment the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment default and loss rates of the underlying collateral structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment

results of operations 

revenues and gross margin   



product revenues 

our business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles in the preceding period 

the increase in product revenues by 28 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to product revenue from our newly acquired orbotech business and increased investments from our foundry and logic customers partially offset by a lower products shipments to customers in the memory business 

service revenues 

service revenues are generated from product maintenance and support services as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers the amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems but it is also impacted by other factors such as our rate of service contract renewals the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

the increase in service revenues by 26 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to service revenues from our newly acquired orbotech business and an increase in the number of customers requesting installations 

revenues by segment 1 



 

1 segment revenues exclude corporate allocation and the effects of foreign exchange rates for additional details refer to note 19 “segment reporting and geographic information” to our consolidated financial statements 

2 segment revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 includes the component inspection business only 

3 orbotech was acquired on february 20 2019 

fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 

revenue from our semiconductor process control segment increased by 16 primarily due to a strong demand from our foundry and logic customers and growth in service revenues the increase in revenues from our specialty semiconductor process pcb display and component inspection and other segments is primarily driven by full year results for the yearended june 30 2020 compared to partial year results for the yearended june 30 2019 and relates to the orbotech business which was acquired in february of 2019 

revenues  top customers 

the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues primarily in semiconductor process control segment for the indicated periods 



revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows 



a significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that trend to continue 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions 

the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage 



changes in gross margin percentage which are driven by the revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues it also includes average customer pricing customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements and the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in gross margin percentage from the mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes within the composition of product and service offerings and amortization of inventory fair value adjustments from business combinations changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements and amortization of intangible assets changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk 

the decrease in our gross margin from 591 to 579 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 is primarily attributable to an increase in amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of orbotech unfavorable mix of products and services sold and an increase in service and manufacturing costs these decreases were partially offset by a favorable impact from higher revenue volume of products and services 

segment gross margin 1 



 

1 segment gross margin is calculated as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues and excludes corporate allocations and the effects of foreign exchange rates amortization of intangible assets inventory fair value adjustments and acquisition related costs for additional details refer to note 19 “segment reporting and geographic information” to our consolidated financial statements 

2 segment gross margin in the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 includes the component inspection business only 

3 orbotech was acquired on february 20 2019 

fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 

the primary factors impacting the performance of our segment gross margins are summarized as follows 

• semiconductor process control segment gross margin remained relatively consistent from prior years 

• the segment gross margins of specialty semiconductor process pcb display and component inspection and other segments primarily relate to the orbotech business which was acquired in february 2019 

research and development “rd”   



rd expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our rd efforts as technological innovation is essential to our success we may incur significant costs associated with rd projects including compensation for engineering talent engineering material costs and other expenses 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 502 million as a result of additional engineering headcount higher employee benefit costs and higher variable compensation and an increase of 1002 million of expenses from the orbotech business partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expense of 43 million

sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 337 million as a result of additional headcount higher employee benefit costs and variable compensation an increase in depreciation expense of 125 million and expenses related to the orbotech business of 1156 million which includes an increase in amortization expense for purchased intangible assets of 308 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in acquisitionrelated expenses of 291 million lower travelrelated expenses of 116 million and 109 million of stockbased compensation expense from acceleration of certain equity awards for orbotech employees recorded in the three months ended march 31 2019 

goodwill impairment 

we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of february 28 2020 and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill for the wafer inspection and patterning global service and support and component inspection reporting units 

however due to the downward revision of financial outlook for the specialty semiconductor process and pcb and display reporting units as well as the impact of elevated risk and macroeconomic slowdown driven by the covid19 pandemic we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for these reporting units as a result we recorded 1442 million and 1125 million in impairment charges in the specialty semiconductor process and pcb and display reporting units respectively in the three months ended march 31 2020 

for our fiscal year ended june 30 2019 we performed our annual qualitative assessment of goodwill during the third quarter and concluded that there was no impairment

interest expense and other expense income net 



the increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 was primarily due to interest on the 120 billion senior notes issued in march 2019 

other expense income net is comprised primarily of realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts and interestrelated accruals such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations and interest income earned on our invested cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

the decrease in other expense income net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in interest income of 172 million other impairments of 88 million and foreign exchange losses of 46 million in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell certain core assets of our nonstrategic solar energy business this transaction resulted in a loss of 19 million which was included in other expense income in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2020 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 loss on extinguishment of debt reflected a pretax net loss of 225 million associated with the redemption of our 5000 million of the senior notes due 2021 including associated redemption premiums accrued interest and other fees and expenses we had no loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended june 30 2019 

provision for income taxes 

the following table provides details of income taxes 



tax expense was lower as a percentage of income before taxes during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 primarily due to the impact of the following items 

• tax expense decreased by 137 million relating to an increase in the foreign derived intangible income deduction during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 

• tax expense decreased by 69 million relating to a decrease in the global intangible low taxed income during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 

• tax expense decreased by 236 million relating to the impact of an increase in the proportion of kla’s earnings generated in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us statutory rate during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 and 

• tax expense decreased by 343 million relating to the impact of an internal restructuring during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 partially offset by 

• tax expense increased by 539 million relating to a 2566 million goodwill impairment charge which is nondeductible for income tax 

our effective tax rate during the fiscal years ended june 30 2019 and june 30 2018 was impacted by the tax cuts and jobs act “the act” which was enacted into law on december 22 2017 the following items are the tax impact as a result of the act 

• tax expense decreased by 509 million relating to the reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate from 350 to 281 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 and tax expense decreased by 499 million relating to the reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate from 281 to 210 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 the act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 350 to 210 as of january 1 2018 the decrease in the us federal corporate tax rate from 350 to 210 results in a blended statutory tax rate of 281 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 

• tax expense increased by 3396 million relating to the onetime transition tax recorded during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 on our total post1986 earnings and profits “ep” of which prior to the enactment of the act was previously deferred from us income taxes 

• tax expense increased by 1021 million relating to the onetime remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 based on the act’s new corporate tax rate of 210 and 

• tax expense decreased by 193 million relating to the transition tax liability during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income the amount of our pretax income as business activities fluctuate nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income nontaxable or nondeductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

in the normal course of business we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world we are subject to federal income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 and are under united states income tax examination for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 we are subject to state income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 we are also subject to examinations in other major foreign jurisdictions including singapore and israel for all years beginning from the calendar year ended december 31 2012 we are under audit in germany related to orbotech for the years ended december 31 2013 to december 31 2015 we are also under audit in israel related to kla for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017 to june 30 2019 although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

in may 2017 orbotech received an assessment from the israel tax authority “ita” with respect to its fiscal years 2012 through 2014 the “assessment” and the “audit period” respectively for an aggregate amount of tax after offsetting all net operating losses “nols” available through the end of 2014 of approximately nis 2290 million equivalent to approximately 660 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the israeli consumer price index as of date of the issuance of the tax decrees 

on august 31 2018 orbotech filed an objection in respect of the tax assessment the “objection” the ita completed the second stage of the audit in which the claims orbotech raised in the objection were examined by different personnel at the ita in addition the ita examined additional items during this second stage of the audit as orbotech and the ita did not reach an agreement during the second stage the ita issued tax decrees to orbotech on august 28 2019 “tax decrees” for an aggregate amount of tax after offsetting all nols available through the end of 2014 of approximately nis 257 million 

equivalent to approximately 74 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the israeli consumer price index as of the date of the issuance of the tax decrees these tax decrees replaced the assessment we believe that our recorded unrecognized tax benefits are sufficient to cover the resolution of these tax decrees 

orbotech filed a notice of appeal with respect to the above tax decrees with the district court of tel aviv on september 26 2019 on february 27 2020 the ita filed its arguments in support of the tax decrees orbotech filed the grounds of appeal with respect to the above tax decrees on july 30 2020 the ita and orbotech are continuing discussions in an effort to resolve this matter in a mutually agreeable manner 

in connection with the above there is an ongoing criminal investigation in israel against orbotech certain of its employees and its tax consultant on april 11 2018 orbotech received a “suspect notification letter” dated march 28 2018 from the tel aviv district attorney’s office fiscal and financial in the letter it was noted that the investigation file was transferred from the assessment investigation officer to the district attorney’s office the letter further states that the district attorney’s office has not yet made a decision regarding submission of an indictment against orbotech and that if after studying the case a decision is made to consider prosecuting orbotech orbotech will receive an additional letter and within 30 days orbotech may present its arguments to the district attorney’s office as to why it should not be indicted on october 27 2019 we received a request for additional information from the district attorneys office we will continue to monitor the progress of the district attorney’s office investigation however we cannot anticipate when the review of the case will be completed and what will be the results thereof we intend to cooperate with the district attorney’s office to enable them to conclude their investigation 

on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act was signed into law which included several tax relief provisions as a result of the cares act we have deferred payment of certain payroll taxes to the federal government through december 31 2022 and accelerated the tax deduction of qualified improvement property the provisions of the cares act do not have a material impact to our liquidity and we are not expecting a material tax refund 

liquidity and capital resources 



cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

as of june 30 2020 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 198 billion which represents an increase of 024 billion from june 30 2019 the increase is mainly due to net proceeds from our 2020 senior notes of 074 billion net proceeds from our revolving credit facility of 045 billion and cash generated from operations of 178 billion partially offset by repayments of debt of 117 billion payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of 052 billion stock repurchases of 083 billion and capital expenditures of 015 billion as of june 30 2020 082 billion of our 198 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices we currently intend to indefinitely reinvest 053 billion of the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries for which we assert that earnings are permanently reinvested if however a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the united states we would be required to accrue and pay state and foreign taxes of approximately 122 of the funds repatriated the amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated we have accrued state and foreign tax on the remaining cash of 029 billion of the 082 

billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices as such these funds can be returned to the us without accruing any additional us tax expense

stock repurchases 

the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended june 30 2020 and 2019 the stock repurchase program is intended in part to offset shares issued in connection with the purchases under our employee stock purchase plan “espp” program and the vesting of employee restricted stock units 

fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 

cash flows from operating activities

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 from 036 billion to 130 billion this change was mainly impacted by lower net proceeds from borrowings of 116 billion partially offset by a decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases of 027 billion

industry 

general background 

kla’s core focus is the semiconductor industry the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is typically 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish other more specialized wafers such as epitaxial silicon “epi” silicon on insulator “soi” gallium nitride “gan” and silicon carbide “sic” are also common in the semiconductor industry 

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper “interconnect” structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality the wafer is then cut into individual chips and the chips that pass functional testing are packaged final testing is performed on all packaged chips packaged chips are mounted onto printed circuit boards “pcbs” for connection to the outside world additionally flat panel displays are manufactured using processes similar to ics eg film deposition photolithography etching except using glass as the starting substrate 

the semiconductor equipment industry is currently experiencing growth from multiple drivers such as demand for chips providing computational power and connectivity for artificial intelligence “ai” applications and continued need for chips from leading edge foundry and logic chip manufacturers that support mobile devices qualification of early extreme ultraviolet “euv” lithography processes and equipment is driving growth at leading logicfoundry and dynamic randomaccess memory “dram” manufacturers expansion of the internet of things “iot” together with the increasing adoption of electrical vehicles and the need for automobile connectivity are accelerating trailingedge node technology conversions and capacity expansions intertwined in these areas spurred by data storage and connectivity needs is the growth in demand for memory chips finally china is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ics government initiatives are propelling china to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting semiconductor manufacturers from taiwan korea japan and the us china is currently seen as an important longterm growth region for the semiconductor capital equipment sector 

supporting this multisegmented market growth the semiconductor industry continues to introduce numerous technology changes new techniques and architectures in production today include three dimensional finfet transistors three dimensional flash memory “3d nand” design technology cooptimization “dtco” advanced patterning technologies including selfaligned multiple patterning and euv lithography and advanced packaging methods kla’s inspection metrology and data analytics technologies play key roles in enabling our customers to develop and manufacture advanced semiconductor devices to support these trends 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to high volume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trends such as a specific design rule shrink today leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies some requiring new substrate and film materials new geometries advanced multipatterning and euv lithography and packaging techniques while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected the adoption of these technologies into full volume production for example as design rules decrease 

 2 

yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects and device performance characteristics namely speed capacity or power management become more sensitive to parameters such as linewidth and film thickness variation new process materials such as photoresists for euv lithography require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost well above 500 billion substantially more than previousgeneration facilities in addition chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment 

by developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and improve their return on investment “roi” once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume our systems help ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution in addition the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules coupled with new materials and device innovation has increased inprocess variability which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling 

kla systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer reticle and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems the ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes this helps them increase their yield of highperformance parts and deliver their products to market faster—thus maximizing their profits with our broad portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ nextgeneration products helping our customers respond to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architectures more demanding lithography processes and new packaging techniques 

with the orbotech acquisition kla has expanded its presence in the semiconductor capital equipment market leveraging products and technologies of orbotech’s spts semiconductor processing business spts develops and sells differentiated custom deposition and etching solutions for fastgrowing markets such as power and analog devices rf communication chips and mems these devices which are often built on nontraditional substrates like sic and gan have become critical to accelerating some of the secular trends in automotive industrial and communication industries infrastructure buildout for 5g is creating demand for rf components new sic and gan based power devices are moving into volume production for electric vehicles and highdensity packaging is growing to support ai

pcb display and component inspection 

printed circuit board “pcb” manufacturing 

pcbs are the basic interconnect platforms for the electronic components that comprise all electronic equipment an assembly of one or more pcbs on which desired components have been mounted forms an essential part of most electronic products pcbs are manufactured in a series of complex steps generally starting with a sheet of epoxyfiberglass or other material with electric insulating qualities laminated with a conducting material such as copper the conductor pattern is subsequently transferred to the substrate either through a direct imaging “di” or photolithographic process and a chemical etching process followed by removal of excess conducting material leaving the desired conducting metal pattern printed on the layer 

because pcbs are susceptible to various defects electrical shorts open circuits and insufficient or offmeasure conductor widths inspection is required throughout pcb production to identify such defects which are then repaired if possible early detection of these defects increases the possibility of successful repair and reduces the number of unusable boards thereby reducing the overall cost to the manufacturer early detection and repair are particularly valuable in cases of multilayered and ‘buildup’ boards wherein pcb layers are embedded inside the finished board 

kla’s orbotech subsidiary manufactures several solutions intended for use by manufacturers of pcbs to streamline and increase the efficiency and yield of pcb production 

direct imaging “di” 

direct imaging technology enables the manufacture of higher density more complex pcbs with significantly higher yields and reduced manufacturing costs through the elimination of artwork costs and the scrap created by contact printing the di involves the transfer of digital image data directly from the electronic media onto the photoresist or solder resist thereby eliminating the need for exposing photoresist through a production photolithography tool this process translates into fewer manufacturing steps lower material costs and greater accuracy of layertolayer registration 

orbotech’s direct imaging di solutions include the nuvogo series the paragonultra series and the orbotech diamond series nuvogo is an advanced di series for substratelike pcb “slp” modified semiadditive process “msap” advanced high density interconnect “hdi” and flex and advanced multilayer pcb “mlb” mass production the paragonultra series serves complex applications including flip chip ball grid array “fcbga” flip chipchip scale package “fccsp” and bgacsp orbotech diamond is a high capacity high throughput di series to address challenging surface topographies

automated optical shaping “aos” 

aos solutions are designed to address certain limitations inherent in the manual repair of pcbs by enabling the automatic shaping of defects in pcb production such defects include excess copper causing electrical shorts and missing copper causing electrical opens efficient shaping can reduce the scrapping of unusable panels during the manufacturing process enabling a significant reduction in manufacturers’ overall manufacturing costs orbotech aos solutions ablate the excess conductor material or add copper where missing and are commonly used for advanced pcbs where manual repair is not practical 

orbotech’s precise series is an automated solution for shaping both open and shorts defects for increasingly fine linespace circuitry the perfix series addresses excess copper defects for advanced ic substrates fine line applications slpmsap advanced flex applications and complex hdi and mlb manufacturing

customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout asia the united states and europe staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor semiconductorrelated and electronic device manufacturers in each of these regions 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2019  2018  and 2017  the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues primarily in semiconductor process control segment 

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor semiconductorrelated and electronic device manufacturers which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ics products utilizing ics and other electronic components we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it has historically been cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or other industries in which we operate or slowdowns in the worldwide economy as well as customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

 14 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are aimed at building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control processenabling and yield management solutions for manufacturing and testing wafers and reticles integrated circuits “ic” or “chip” packaging light emitting diodes power devices compound semiconductor devices microelectromechanical systems data storage printed circuit boards and flat and flexible panel displays as well as general materials research our customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility which are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier for multiple products and services our revenues are derived primarily from product sales and related service contracts mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in asia the united states and europe we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2019  we employed approximately 4280 fulltime sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of subsidiaries or branches in other countries including china germany israel united kingdom japan singapore korea and taiwan international revenues accounted for approximately 87  88  and 86  of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended june 30 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 17 “segment reporting and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in nonus dollar product sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in item 1a “risk factors” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our backlog which represents our performance obligation to deliver products and services totaled 184 billion and 162 billion  as of june 30 2019  and 2018  respectively and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received and a majority of the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months orders for service contracts and unreleased products are included in the backlog all orders are subject to risk of delays pushouts and cancellation by the customer usually with limited or no penalties 

because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods the historical cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between on the one hand our ability to manufacture deliver and install products and on the other the requirements of our customers in our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources management of our operating model and other factors we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries and installations of products which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products 

 15 

research and development 

the market for semiconductor and electronics industries is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs in addition we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby certain government agencies or other third parties fund a portion of our research and development costs as of june 30 2019  we employed approximately 2710 fulltime research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  involved the development of process control and yield management equipment aimed at addressing the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes and new packaging techniques for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product research and development even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to enhance our competitive position new product introductions however may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products and if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in the united states singapore israel germany united kingdom italy and china as of june 30 2019  we employed approximately 1690 fulltime manufacturing personnel 

some critical parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications while other parts are standard commercial products we use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers through our business interruption planning we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by among other things monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources or disruptions within our suppliers’ oftencomplex supply chains could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for technologically advanced process control processenabling and yield management solutions used by semiconductor and electronics manufactures is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors such as applied materials inc asml holding nv hitachi hightechnologies corporation nanometrics inc and rudolph technologies inc some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a 

 16 

broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability interoperability with the existing installed base and technical service and support as well as overall cost of ownership 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions and alliances 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business no single patent copyright or trade secret is in itself essential to us as a whole or to any of our business segments 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment including without limitation the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial condition results of operations or competitive position 

however any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of june 30 2019  we employed approximately 10020 fulltime employees except for our employees in belgium where a trade union delegation has been recognized and our employees in the german operations of our mie business unit who are represented by employee works council none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

 17 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees

risk factors 

tableend a description of factors that could materially affect our business financial condition or operating results is provided below 

risks associated with our industry 

ongoing changes in the technology industry as well as the semiconductor industry in particular could expose our business to significant risks 

the industries that we serve including the semiconductor flat panel display and printed circuit board industries are constantly developing and changing over time many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve pricing trends in the endmarkets for consumer electronics and other products which place a growing emphasis on our customers’ cost of ownership changes in our customers’ capital spending patterns and in general an environment of constant change and development including decreasing product and component dimensions use of new materials and increasingly complex device structures applications and process steps if we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends or with respect to technological advances if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry as significant majority of our sales are our process control and yield management products sold to semiconductor manufacturers some of the trends that our management monitors in operating our business include the following 



 20 

any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers’ rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce which could result in downward pressure on our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been highly concentrated due to corporate consolidation acquisitions and business closures in this environment orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales this increasing concentration exposes our business financial condition and operating results to a number of risks including the following 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 21 

we operate in industries that have historically been cyclical including the semiconductor industry the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the condition of the industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the industries in which we serve are difficult to predict the historically cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry in which we primarily operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization consumer demand for products inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in or cancellation or delay of orders which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customer’s funding status which could be weakened not only by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or companyspecific reasons but also by funding limitations imposed by the customer’s unique organizational structure any of these factors could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results then our business could be seriously harmed furthermore any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

in addition our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics which when made are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time however largely due to the historical cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles our actual results may vary and have varied in the past from forecasted results these variations can occur for any number of reasons including but not limited to unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders product shipments or product acceptance an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to adapt to changing business conditions or a different than anticipated effective tax rate the impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment this is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues but also due to the advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order to meet the expected lead times to significant inventory writeoffs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided we provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of management’s expectations for the future but those reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of and are themselves forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this item 1a and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements if our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts or if we revise our forecasts the market price of our common stock could decline 

 22 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the industries in which we serve including the semiconductor flat panel display and printed circuit board industries depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver appears to be slowing which may cause semiconductor manufacturers to delay investments in equipment investigate more complex device architectures use new materials and develop innovative fabrication processes these and other evolving customer plans and needs require us to respond with continued development programs and cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards develop and introduce new products and solutions that successfully address changing customer needs win market acceptance of these new products and solutions and manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner our failure to accurately predict evolving industry standards and develop as well as offer competitive technology solutions in a timely manner with costeffective products could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance features and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

in addition the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks we regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer even before receiving the customer’s formal acceptance of that product in certain situations including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted however our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents all of which must perform to their respective specifications so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall product’s required specifications in such a situation the customer may be entitled to certain remedies which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and as a result our stock price 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of inspection products as a result any delay or reduction of sales of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results the continued customer demand for these products and the development introduction and market acceptance of new products and technologies are critical to our future success 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own which may adversely affect our business in addition we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects the termination of any such collaboration or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration could significantly impair our research and development efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of continuing significant investments in product research and development however we may enter new markets whether through acquisitions or new internal product development in which competition is based primarily on product pricing not technological superiority further some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing through our business interruption planning we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by among other things monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers certain key parts are available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers also key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers’ proprietary intellectual property in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for highperformance hightechnology components which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products in addition if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations which is a heightened risk especially during economic downturns it could affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products similarly especially with respect to suppliers of hightechnology components our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in a timely manner and result in delays for our products our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms furthermore a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons including the supplier’s financial condition or business operational decisions which would require us to purchase in a single transaction a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers such “endoflife” parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory writeoff either of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods 

 24 

if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan our operating results business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted 

we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually revised frequently generally quarterly and reviewed by management even more frequently at least monthly our business plan is developed based on a number of factors many of which require estimates and assumptions such as our expectations of the economic environment future business levels our customers’ willingness and ability to place orders leadtimes and future revenue and cash flow our budgeted operating expenses for example are based in part on our future revenue expectations however our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors including the volatile and historically cyclical nature of our primary industry customer order cancellations macroeconomic changes operational matters regarding particular agreements our ability to manage customer deliveries the availability of resources for the installation of our products delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a 

because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results similarly if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period which would also negatively affect our results of operations if we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted such an outcome could cause customers suppliers or investors to view us as less stable or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates any of which could have an adverse impact on our stock price 

in addition our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources the need to manage our operating model and other factors in furtherance of those efforts we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries installations and payment scheduling any such decisions may impact our ability to recognize revenue including the fiscal period during which such revenue may be recognized with respect to such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or stock price 

we have a leveraged capital structure 

as of june 30 2019  we had 345 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes additionally we have commitments for an unfunded revolving credit facility of 100 billion  under the credit agreement we may incur additional indebtedness in the future by accessing the unfunded portion of our revolving credit facility andor entering into new financing arrangements for example at the same time we announced our intention to acquire orbotech we also announced a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase up to 200 billion of our common stock a large portion of which would be financed with new indebtedness our ability to pay interest and repay the principal of our current indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations our credit rating the ongoing interest rate environment and the other risk factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in addition the interest rates of the senior unsecured longterm notes may be subject to adjustments from time to time if moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” or under certain circumstances a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for moody’s or sp as the case may be a “substitute rating agency” downgrades or subsequently upgrades its rating assigned to the respective series of notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade accordingly changes by moody’s sp or a substitute rating agency to the rating of any series of notes our outlook or credit rating could require us to pay additional interest which may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline factors that can affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the industries we serve our financial position including the incurrence of additional indebtedness and our business strategy 

 25 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of notes by at least two of moody’s sp and fitch inc unless we have exercised our right to redeem the notes of such series we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or at the holder’s option any part of each holder’s notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below the “change of control offer” in the change of control offer we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any on the notes repurchased up to but not including the date of repurchase we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of that series of notes our ability to repurchase that series of notes in such event may be limited by law by the indenture associated with that series of notes or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time if we fail to repurchase that series of notes as required by the terms of such notes it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing that series of notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate and an increase in interest rates would require us to pay additional interest on any borrowings which may have an adverse effect on the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline the interest rate under our revolving credit facility is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades additionally under our revolving credit facility we are required to comply with affirmative and negative covenants which include the maintenance of certain financial ratios the details of which can be found in note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

 if we fail to comply with these covenants we will be in default and our borrowings will become immediately due and payable there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time in addition certain of our domestic subsidiaries are required to guarantee our borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the event that we default on our borrowings these domestic subsidiaries shall be liable for our borrowings which could disrupt our operations and result in a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

our leveraged capital structure may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and net income per share 

our issuance and maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to 

 our ability to satisfy our future expenses as well as our new debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our future operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our future expenses and service our new debt obligations which may impact our ability to manage our capital structure to preserve and maintain our investment grade rating if our future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows we may need to access money available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility or enter into new financing arrangements to obtain necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms any borrowings under our revolving credit facility will place further pressure on us to comply with the financial covenants if we fail to make a payment associated with our debt obligations we could be in default on such debt and such a default could cause us to be in default on our other obligations 

 26 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors first instituted a quarterly dividend during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 since that time we have announced a number of increases in the amount of our quarterly dividend level as well as payment of a special cash dividend that was declared and substantially paid in the second quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30 2015 we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends may be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws changes to our business model and our increased interest and principal payments required by our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions including our indemnification of third parties as well as the performance of our products 

although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties costly and timeconsuming litigation or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes or could impact our revenue or cost recognition any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in our commercial agreements from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers suppliers and lessors with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes in addition notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations whether or not asserted due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects especially when products are first introduced unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us including increased service or warranty costs providing product replacements for or modifications to defective products litigation related to defective products reimbursement for damages caused by our products product recalls or product writeoffs or disposal costs these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business financial condition and operating results in addition our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

 27 

furthermore we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives such as credits toward future purchases we believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our longterm business as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase higher volumes of our products however these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives our volume purchase agreements require significant estimation for the amounts to be accrued depending upon the estimate of volume of future purchases as such we are required to update our estimates of the accruals on a periodic basis until the earnings process is complete our estimates could differ in comparison to actual results as a result these volume purchase arrangements while expected to be beneficial to our business over time could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in nearterm periods including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and therefore our gross margins 

in addition we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customerspecific commitments on pricing tool reliability spare parts stocking levels response time and other commitments furthermore we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection to date we have made no significant accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in supporting an audit or inspection or defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

there are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development 

we are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies both domestically and internationally governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion or a project may be terminated by mutual agreement if the parties determine that the project’s goals or milestones are not being achieved so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future in addition under the terms of these government grants the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur directly and indirectly in connection with such programs any such audit could result in modifications to or even termination of the applicable government funding program for example if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program those costs would not be reimbursed and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded we do not know the outcome of any future audits any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties financial or otherwise termination of funding programs suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency any of which could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our business 

historically we have recorded material restructuring charges related to our prior global workforce reductions large excess inventory writeoffs and material impairment charges related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans or do so within the expected time frame if we again restructure our organization and business processes implement additional cost reduction actions or discontinue certain business operations we may take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to among other things employee terminations or exit costs we may also be required to writeoff additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline also as our lead times from suppliers increase due to the increasing complexity of the parts and components they provide and the lead times demanded by our customers decrease due to the time pressures they face when introducing new products or technology or bringing new facilities into production we may be compelled to increase our commitments and therefore our risk exposure to inventory purchases to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner and that inventory may need to be writtenoff if demand for the underlying product declines for any reason such additional writeoffs could result in material charges 

 28 

in the past we have recorded material charges related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives based on economic benefit if known or using the straightline method and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for longlived assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and as applicable the amount of any previous impairment charge could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge 

any such additional material charges whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements 

we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements 

we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions any of which may prove not to be financially viable if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables however by entering into these arrangements and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services we are exposed to additional risks if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered 

in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws if we were to violate any such law we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general commercial operational financial and regulatory risks 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges including but not limited to 



 29 

 in addition government controls either by the united states or other countries that restrict our business overseas or the import or export of our products or increase the cost of our operations through the imposition of tariffs or otherwise could harm our business for example effective on october 30 2018 the united states department of commerce added fujian jinhua integrated circuit company ltd “jhicc” to its entity list restricting exports of technology to jhicc without a license as a result unless jhicc is subsequently removed from the entity list we will be unable to fulfill orders jhicc has made for our products accept future orders placed by jhicc for our products and provide services for any of our products already installed at jhicc 

any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy 

demand for our products is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending which caused our customers to decrease cancel or delay their equipment and service orders from us in the economic slowdown during fiscal year 2009 in addition the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell reduced demand combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of such financing has at times in the past adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels 

in addition a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and where applicable credit ratings a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity if the market value of such investments were to decline or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

 30 

we might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property or other confidential information that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the industries in which we serve from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information in addition we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties with respect to intellectual property infringement disputes our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however there can be no assurance that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition furthermore we may potentially be subject to claims by customers suppliers or other business partners or by governmental law enforcement agencies related to our receipt distribution andor use of thirdparty intellectual property or confidential information legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit and associated internal investigations with respect to intellectual property or confidential information disputes are often expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert management’s attention and other company resources andor may result in restrictions on our ability to sell our products settlements on significantly adverse terms or adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines any of which could have a significant negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings claims or investigations the instigation of legal proceedings or claims our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims or the determination of any adverse findings against us or any of our employees in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our business reputation 

we are exposed to various risks related to the legal regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to compliance with new existing different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust anticorruptionantibribery unclaimed property and export control regulations our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws rules or regulations or changes to existing laws rules or regulations including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business from time to time we may receive inquiries or audit notices from governmental or regulatory bodies or we may participate in voluntary disclosure programs related to legal regulatory or tax compliance matters and these inquiries notices or programs may result in significant financial cost including investigation expenses defense costs assessments and penalties reputational harm and other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations including those that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental regulations including regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute potentially more expensive andor rarer materials further we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by any release regardless of fault we also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the materials composition of our products including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources of certain metals and other materials the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business 

 31 

in addition we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment immigration contracts product performance product liability antitrust environmental regulations securities unfair competition and other matters these legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit our ability to sell our products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims which could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our current and future needs our business and operations could be harmed 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation information systems management and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting and procurement functions to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations in addition many of these outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage employ cloud computing technology for such storage these providers’ cloud computing systems may be susceptible to “cyber incidents” such as intentional cyber attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cybersecurity compromises which are outside of our control if we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as anticipated or do not adequately protect our data from cyberrelated security breaches or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes we may experience operational difficulties such as limitations on our ability to ship products increased costs manufacturing or service interruptions or delays loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data quality and compliance issues and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and cyber incidents 

in the conduct of our business we collect use transmit and store data on information systems this data includes confidential information transactional information and intellectual property belonging to us our customers and our business partners as well as personallyidentifiable information of individuals we allocate significant resources to network security data encryption and other measures to protect our information systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse despite our ongoing efforts to enhance our network security measures our information systems are susceptible to computer viruses cyberrelated security breaches and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions tampering misuse criminal acts including phishing or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate and are subject to the inherent vulnerabilities of network security measures we have experienced cyberrelated attacks in the past and may experience cyberrelated attacks in the future our security measures may also be breached due to employee errors malfeasance or otherwise third parties may also attempt to influence employees users suppliers or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our our customers’ or business partners’ data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to the information systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

any of such occurrences could result in disruptions to our operations misappropriation corruption or theft of confidential information including intellectual property and other critical data of kla our customers and other business partners misappropriation of funds and company assets reduced value of our investments in research development and engineering litigation with or payment of damages to third parties reputational damage costs to comply with regulatory inquiries or actions data privacy issues costs to rebuild our internal information systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs 

 32 

we carry insurance that provides some protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident but it will not likely cover all such losses and the losses that it does not cover may be significant 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact our business operations 

our global operations are dependent upon certain information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications system failures or malfunctioning such as difficulties with our customer relationship management “crm” system could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results our enterprise resource planning “erp” system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records record transactions provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems whether in connection with the regular operation periodic enhancements modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort in february 2019 we announced that we had consummated our acquisition of orbotech we may also enter into definitive agreements for and consummate acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses if the costs associated with integrating the acquired business exceeds our expectations or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than anticipated in addition we may lose key employees of the acquired companies as a result risks associated with acquisition transactions may lead to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons including 

 at times we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary highly sensitive information the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results

disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations or in the operations of our customers due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states singapore israel germany united kingdom italy and china in addition our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors as well as our other operations and those of our customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fire earthquake volcanic eruptions energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites we cannot provide any assurance that alternate means of conducting our operations whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if such alternate means were available they could be obtained on favorable terms 

in addition as part of our costcutting actions we have consolidated several operating facilities our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above such as acts of war or terrorism earthquakes fires or other natural disasters if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at or acts of war in the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the industries we serve could adversely affect our business increased international political instability in various parts of the world disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations we maintain significant operations in israel since the establishment of the state of israel in 1948 a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility varying in degree and intensity has led to security and economic challenges for israel in addition some our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and may be called to active military duty in emergency circumstances we cannot assess the impact that emergency conditions in israel in the future may have on our business operations financial condition or results of operations but it could be material instability in any region could directly impact our ability to operate our business or our customers’ ability to operate their businesses cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate instability in the region could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we selfinsure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain risks are uninsurable are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance accordingly we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds the applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy for example we do not currently hold earthquake insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations a significant portion of which are conducted in california an area highly susceptible to earthquakes it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products much of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we selfinsure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also selfinsured either based on a similar costbenefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the japanese yen the euro the pound sterling and the israeli new shekel we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally in addition an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the united states and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected furthermore if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge we may experience material financial losses 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments impairment of our investments could harm our earnings in addition we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that are susceptible to changes in market interest rates and bond yields as market interest rates and bond yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss we believe we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity however an impairment of the fair market value of our investments even if unrealized must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

in addition the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets our operating results or other performance metrics or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies 

we are exposed to risks in connection with tax and regulatory compliance audits in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits such as related to customs or product safety requirements in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes penalties fines or other prohibitions against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that our products and practices comply with applicable regulations the final determination of any such audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals related to income taxes and other contingencies in addition to and in connection with the israel tax authority “ita” assessment described in more detail in note 13 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements there is an ongoing criminal investigation against our orbotech subsidiary certain of its employees and its tax consultant that began prior to the acquisition date we can make no assurances that an indictment will not result from the criminal investigation the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

we earn profits in and are therefore potentially subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions including singapore israel and the cayman islands the countries in which we earn the majority of our nonus profits due to economic political or other conditions tax rates in those jurisdictions may be subject to significant change a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in the tax rates imposed by those jurisdictions expiration of tax holidays in certain jurisdictions that are not renewed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in stockbased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of earnings from outside the us for which we have not previously provided for us taxes a change in our effective tax rate can materially and adversely impact our results from operations 

 35 

in addition recent changes to us tax laws will significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings numerous countries are evaluating their existing tax laws due in part to recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd’s” base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project as of december 31 2018 we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the act which was enacted into law on december 22 2017 however the recent us tax law changes are subject to future guidance from us federal and state governments such as the treasury department andor the irs any future guidance can change our tax liability a significant portion of the income taxes due to the enactment of the act is payable by us over a period of eight years as a result our cash flows from operating activities will be adversely impacted until tax liability is paid in full 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements has become increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices or changes in interpretations of such standards practices or rules can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting standards and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future changes to or revised interpretations or applications of existing accounting standards or tax rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business for example in february 2016 the fasb issued an accounting standard update which amends the existing accounting standards for leases adoption of new standards may require changes to our processes accounting systems and internal controls difficulties encountered during adoption could result in internal control deficiencies or delay the reporting of our financial results in addition the passing of the act in december 2017 caused us to significantly increase our provision for income taxes which had a material adverse effect on our net income for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 further interpretations of the act from the government and regulatory organizations may change our tax expense provided for our transitional tax liability and deferred tax adjustments as well as our provision liability or accounting treatment of the provisional liability which may potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts

executive summary 

we are a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products and related service software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process from research and development to final volume production we provide leading edge equipment software and support that enable ic manufacturers to identify resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost in addition to serving the semiconductor industry we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries including advanced packaging light emitting diode  “ led ” power devices compound semiconductor and data storage industries as well as general materials research 

our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer ic lithography reticle “reticle” or “mask” and hard disk drive manufacturers around the world our products services and expertise are used by our customers to measure detect analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes 

our revenues are driven largely by our customers’ spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand or expansion plans our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets  memory foundry and logic all three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in enduser demand which influence the level and pattern of our customers’ spending on our products and services although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics communications data processing and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions particularly in the foundry and logic markets which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market 

through the acquisition of orbotech ltd “orbotech” we have expanded our reach in the electronics value chain to include technologically advanced yieldenhancing and processenabling solutions to address various manufacturing stages of printed circuit boards “pcb” flat panel displays “fpd” specialty semiconductor devices “sd” and other electronic components the products include automated optical inspection “aoi” automated optical shaping “aos” direct imaging “di” additive printing laser drilling laser plotters computer aided manufacturing “cam” and engineering solutions for pcb and additional adjacent electronics component manufacturing as well as aoi test repair and process monitoring systems for fpd manufacturing and vacuum process tools for etch physical vapor deposition “pvd” molecular vapor deposition “mvd” and chemical vapor deposition “cvd” solutions for sd manufacturing 

in our newly acquired orbotech business consumer end markets have been experiencing a fundamental shift in technology complexity driven primarily by the proliferation of highend mobile devices and automotive devices as well as by the demand for large area fpds such as largesize lcd televisions and oled displays the shift towards 5g connectivity and the fastpaced growth of the internet of things “iot” services is expected to continue to further accelerate this shift as more devices become connected and dependent upon other electronic devices 

 41 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor semiconductorrelated and electronics industries our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability as our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings in the global semiconductor and electronics related industries china is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ics additionally a significant portion of global fpd and pcb manufacturing has migrated to china government initiatives are propelling china to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting semiconductor manufacturers from taiwan korea japan and the us china is currently seen as an important longterm growth region for the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment sector we are also subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor semiconductorrelated and electronics industries the timing length intensity and volatility of the capacityoriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable 

the semiconductor and electronics industries have also been characterized by constant technological innovation currently there are multiple drivers for growth in the industry with increased demand for chips providing computation power and connectivity for artificial intelligence “ai” applications and support for mobile devices at the leading edge of foundry and logic chip manufacturing qualification of early extreme ultraviolet “euv” lithography processes and equipment is driving growth at leading logicfoundry and dynamic randomaccess memory “dram” manufacturers expansion of iot together with increasing acceptance of advanced driver assistance systems “adas” in anticipation of the introduction of autonomous cars have begun to accelerate legacynode technology conversions and capacity expansions intertwined in these areas spurred by data storage and connectivity needs is the growth in demand for memory chips on the other hand higher design costs for the most advanced ics could economically constrain leadingedge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications we believe that over the long term our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications that fuel demand for process control equipment although the growth for such equipment may be adversely impacted by higher design costs for advanced ics reuse of installed products and delays in production ramps by our customers in response to higher costs and technical challenges at more advanced technology nodes 

additionally current trends in smart mobile devices 5g connectivity automotive electronics smart vehicles flexible displays arvr and wearable devices highperformance computing large size televisions and the iot are expected to drive the need for production inspection test and repair solutions that are able to address the cuttingedge technology embedded in these types of electronic products 

the demand for our products and our revenue levels are driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate advanced ics that are incorporated into sophisticated mobile devices our customers continuously seek to increase yields and enhance the efficiency of their manufacturing processes including by improving their manufacturing inspection testing and repair capabilities 

subsequent to the orbotech acquisition we changed our organizational structure resulting in four reportable segments semiconductor process control specialty semiconductor process pcb display and component inspection and other prior period results have been recast to conform to the current presentation 

our view of the current wafer fab equipment demand climate is aligned with consensus industry analyst expectations for the calendar year 2019 which reflects a decline in capital equipment spending by memory customers in contrast to the memory business capital equipment spending by foundry and logic customers at the leading edge has begun to ramp up and the momentum is expected to continue in calendar year 2019 we have already seen our mix of business begin to shift toward increased purchases by logic and foundry customers as a percentage of total sales and we expect spending from these customers to continue to remain strong because of a more diversified semiconductor deviceend demand and disciplined capacity planning by wafer fab equipment customers we believe the longterm growth dynamics for the industry remain strong while manufacturers of pcbs fpds sds and other electronic components create different products for diverse endmarkets they share similar production challenges in an increasingly competitive environment 

 42 

the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years 1    



 

 

total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  increased by 13  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  our year over year revenue growth reflected strong demand in the semiconductor process control market growth in service revenues and additional revenues from the orbotech business which was acquired in the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 

acquisition of orbotech ltd   

on february 20 2019 we completed the acquisition of orbotech for total purchase consideration of approximately 326  billion orbotech’s core business enables electronic device manufacturers to inspect test and measure printed circuit boards and flat panel displays to verify their quality pattern electronic circuitry on substrate and perform threedimensional shaping of metalized circuits on multiple surfaces and utilize advanced vacuum deposition and etching process in semiconductor device and semiconductor manufacturing and to perform laser drilling of electronic substrates for additional details on the financial statement impacts of the orbotech acquisition refer to note 6 “business combinations” to our consolidated financial statements 

in addition our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase of up to 200 billion of our common stock reflecting an increase from 100 billion upon the close of the orbotech acquisition we raised approximately 120 billion in new longterm debt financing to partially refinance our existing debt to repurchase shares and for general corporate purposes for additional details refer to note 8 “debt” and note 10 “stock repurchase program” to our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following 

revenue recognition  we primarily derive revenue from the sale of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries maintenance and support of all these products installation and training services and the sale of spare parts our solutions provide a comprehensive portfolio of inspection metrology and data analytics products which are accompanied by a flexible portfolio of services to enable our customers to maintain the performance and productivity of the solutions purchased the acquisition of orbotech enabled us to broaden our portfolio to include the yield enhancement and production solutions used by manufacturers of printed circuit boards flat panel displays advanced packaging microelectromechanical systems and other electronic components 

 43 

our solutions are generally not sold with a right of return nor have we experienced significant returns from or refunds to our customers 

we account for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties the rights of the parties are identified payment terms are identified the contract has commercial substance and collectibility of consideration is probable 

our revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties such as sales taxes the revenues are recognized as separate performance obligations that are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to the customer 

our arrangements with our customers include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations a product or service is considered distinct if it is separately identifiable from other deliverables in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer 

the transaction consideration including any sales incentives is allocated between separate performance obligations of an arrangement based on the standalone selling prices “ssp” for each distinct product or service management considers a variety of factors to determine the ssp such as historical standalone sales of products and services discounting strategies and other observable data 

from time to time our contracts are modified to account for additional or to change existing performance obligations our contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively 

product revenue 

we recognize revenue from product sales at a point in time when we have satisfied our performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer we use judgment to evaluate whether the control has transferred by considering several indicators including 

 not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer in circumstances in which revenue is recognized prior to the product acceptance the portion of revenue associated with our performance obligations to install product is deferred and recognized upon acceptance 

we enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers we adjust the transaction consideration for estimated credits earned by our customers for such incentives these credits are estimated based upon the forecasted and actual product sales for any given period and agreedupon incentive rate the estimate is updated at each reporting period 

we offer perpetual and term licenses for defects and data analysis software the primary difference between perpetual and term licenses is the duration over which the customer can benefit from the use of the software while the functionality and the features of the software are the same with the acquisition of orbotech we offer computeraided manufacturing and engineering software solutions for the printed circuit boards production software is generally bundled with postcontract customer support “pcs” which includes unspecified software updates that are made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement revenue from software licenses is recognized at a point in time when the software is made available to the customer revenue from pcs is deferred at contract inception and recognized ratably over the service period or as services are performed 

 44 

services and spare parts revenue 

the majority of product sales include a standard 6 to 12month warranty that is not separately paid for by the customers the customers may also purchase extended warranty for periods beyond the initial year as part of the initial product sale we have concluded that the standard 12month warranty as well as any extended warranty periods included in the initial product sales are separate performance obligations the estimated fair value of warranty services is deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the warranty period as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of warranty services provided by us 

additionally we offer product maintenance and support services which the customer may purchase separately from the standard and extended warranty offered as part of the initial product sale revenue from separately negotiated maintenance and support service contracts is also recognized over time based on the terms of the applicable service period revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract including training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed we also sell spare parts revenue from which is recognized when control over the spare parts is transferred to the customer 

installation services include connecting and validating configuration of the product in addition several testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to customer specifications revenues from product installation are deferred and recognized at a point in time once installation is complete 

significant judgments 

our contracts with our customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services each product and service is generally capable of being distinct within the context of the contract and represents a separate performance obligation determining the ssp for each distinct performance obligation and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements we typically estimate the ssp of products and services based on observable transactions when the products and services are sold on a standalone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable range we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of these products by customers and circumstances in these instances we use information such as the size of the customer geographic region as well as customization of the products in determining the ssp in instances where the ssp is not directly observable we determine the ssp using information that includes market conditions entityspecific factors including discounting strategies information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs while changes in the allocation of ssp between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular contract any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and result of operations 

although the products are generally not sold with a right of return we may provide other credits or sales incentives which are accounted for either as variable consideration or material right depending on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement these credits and incentives are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if and when additional information becomes available 

as outlined above we use judgments to evaluate whether or not the customer has obtained control of the product and considers the several indicators in evaluating whether or not control has transferred to the customer not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer 

contract assetsliabilities 

the timing of revenue recognition billings and cash collections may result in accounts receivable contract assets and contract liabilities deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets a receivable is recorded in the period we deliver products or provide services when we have an unconditional right to payment contract assets primarily relate to the value of products and services transferred to the customer for which the right to payment is not just dependent on the passage of time contract assets are transferred to receivable when rights to payment become unconditional 

a contract liability is recognized when we receive payment or have an unconditional right to payment in advance of the satisfaction of performance the contract liabilities represent 1 deferred product revenue related to the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers and for which the control has not been transferred to the customers and 2 deferred service revenue which is recorded when we receive consideration or such consideration is unconditionally due from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a contract deferred service revenue typically results from warranty services and maintenance and other service contracts 

 45 

contract assets and liabilities related to rights and obligations in a contract are recorded net in the consolidated balance sheets upon the adoption of asc 606 deferred costs of revenue are included in other current assets while under the legacy guidance deferred costs of revenue was included in deferred system profit 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales customer contracts and acquired technologies expected costs to develop inprocess research and development into commercially viable products estimated cash flows from the projects when completed including assumptions associated with the technology migration curve estimated royalty rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets and discount rates the discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired including inprocess research and development “iprd” based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which will not exceed one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 

the fair value of iprd is initially capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the iprd assets may not be recoverable impairment of iprd is recorded to research and development expenses when an iprd project is completed the iprd is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized to costs of revenues over the asset’s estimated useful life 

acquisitionrelated expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or net realizable value net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value we review and set standard costs semiannually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

allowance for doubtful accounts  a majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to record additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income

accounting for stockbased compensation plans  we account for stockbased awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards the fair value of stockbased awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period the fair value for restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units the fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date the award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests ie the award holder is entitled to receive credits payable in cash or shares of our common stock equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award compensation expense for restricted stock units with performance metrics is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant or when a grant contains a market condition the grant date fair value using a monte carlo simulation the monte carlo simulation incorporates estimates of the potential outcomes of the market condition on the grant date fair value of each award additionally we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimated amounts the fair value is determined using a blackscholes valuation model for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan the blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of assumptions including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the marketbased historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock 

contingencies and litigation  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see note 14 “commitments and contingencies” and note 15 “litigation and other legal matters” to our consolidated financial statements for additional details 

goodwill and purchased intangible assets  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable longlived purchased intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable see note 7 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination we performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit during the third quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  and concluded that there was no impairment in addition as a result of the orbotech acquisition we updated our organizational structure and performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill for our reporting units which were impacted by the organizational change and concluded that there were no impairment indicators affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test the next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the third quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30 2020  

if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions we may be required to perform quantitative goodwill impairment analysis in addition if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets we may be required to record goodwill andor intangible asset impairment charges in future periods whether in connection with our next annual impairment assessment or prior to that if any triggering event occurs outside of the quarter during which the annual goodwill impairment assessment is performed it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or if it does whether such charge would be material to our results of operations 

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires income tax effects for changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which the law is enacted 

transition tax liability is recognized in the period when the change in the us tax law was enacted and the income tax effects are recorded as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations several inputs were considered in the calculation such as the calculation of the post1986 foreign earnings and profit “ep” income tax pools for all foreign subsidiaries and the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets we applied the current interpretations from the us federal and state governments and regulatory organization in its calculation of the transition tax liability 

 47 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

we record income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us our effective tax rate would be adversely affected if we change our intent or if such undistributed earnings are needed for us operations because we would be required to provide or pay income taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings 

global intangible lowtaxed income the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” includes provisions for global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations this income will effectively be taxed at a 105 tax rate in general as a result our deferred tax assets and liabilities were being evaluated to determine if the deferred tax assets and liabilities should be recognized for the basis differences expected to reverse as a result of gilti provisions that are effective for us after the fiscal year ending june 30 2018 or should the tax on gilti provisions be recognized as period costs in each year incurred we elected to account for gilti as a component of current period tax expense starting from the first quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30 2019 

valuation of marketable securities our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration of the investment the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment default and loss rates of the underlying collateral structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment

results of operations 

revenues and gross margin   

on july 1 2018 we adopted asc 606 using the modified retrospective transition approach results for reporting periods beginning after june 30 2018 are presented under asc 606 while prior period amounts are presented under legacy guidance for additional details refer to note 2 “revenue” to our consolidated financial statements 



product revenues 

our business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles in the preceding period 

the increase in product revenues by 7 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to product revenue from our newly acquired orbotech business increased investments from our foundry and wafer customers and a favorable impact from the adoption of asc 606 due to our earlier timing of transfer of control partially offset by a lower products shipments to customers in the memory business 

service revenues 

service revenues are generated from product maintenance and support services as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers the amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems but it is also impacted by other factors such as our rate of service contract renewals the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

the increase in service revenues by 34 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to service revenues from our newly acquired orbotech business the impact of adoption of asc 606 whereby revenue from the standard warranty represents a separate performance obligation and included in our services revenue and an increase in the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites 

revenues by segment 1   



 



 49 

fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 

revenue from our semiconductor process control segment increased by 3 primarily due to a strong demand from our customers in the patterning business and growth in service revenues the increase in revenues from specialty semiconductor process pcb display and component inspection and other segments primarily relates to the orbotech business which was acquired in february of 2019 

fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 

revenue from our semiconductor process control segment increased by 16 primarily due to increases from sales of both our wafer inspection and patterning products as our customers continue to invest in the process control and services and an increase in the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over this time period 

revenues  top customers 

the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues primarily in semiconductor process control segment for the indicated periods 

revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows 

a significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that trend to continue 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions 

 50 

the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage 

changes in gross margin percentage which are driven by the revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues it also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements changes in gross margin percentage from the mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes within the composition of product and service offerings and amortization of inventory fair value adjustments from business combinations changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements and amortization of intangible assets changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk 

the decrease in our gross margin to 591  from 641  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 is primarily attributable to the acquisition of orbotech which historically had lower product gross margins an increase in service and manufacturing costs and a lower revenue volume of products and services these trends were partially offset by a favorable mix of products and services sold 

segment gross margin 1   



 



 51 

fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 

the primary factors impacting the performance of our segment gross margins are summarized as follows 

 fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 

the primary factors impacting the performance of our segment gross margins are summarized as follows 



research and development “rd”   



rd expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our rd efforts as technological innovation is essential to our success we may incur significant costs associated with rd projects including compensation for engineering talent engineering material costs and other expenses 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 362 million as a result of additional engineering headcount and higher employee benefit costs an increase in depreciation expense of 51 million and 557 million of expenses from the orbotech business 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our research and development we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies 

selling general and administrative “sga” 



sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 111 million as a result of additional headcount and higher employee benefit costs an increase in acquisitionrelated expenses of 220 million 109 million of stockbased compensation expense acceleration for certain equity awards for orbotech employees and 918 million of expenses from the orbotech business including 302 million of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets 

 52 

interest expense and other expense income net 



the increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  was primarily due to interest on the 120 billion senior notes issued in march 2019 

other expense income net is comprised primarily of realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts and interestrelated accruals such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations and interest income earned on our invested cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

the increase in other expense income net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  was primarily due to an increase in interest income of 37 million partially offset by an increase in accruals related to uncertain tax positions of 26 million 

provision for income taxes 

the following table provides details of income taxes 



our effective tax rate during the fiscal years ended june 30 2019  and june 30 2018  was impacted by the tax cuts and jobs act “the act” which was enacted into law on december 22 2017 income tax effects resulting from changes in tax laws are accounted for by us in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that these tax effects be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted and the effects are recorded as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the act as a result we recorded a tax benefit of 193 million during the year ended june 30 2019  relating to the transition tax liability provided by the act 

tax expense was lower as a percentage of income before taxes during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  primarily due to the impact of the following items 

 our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income the amount of our pretax income as business activities fluctuate nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income nontaxable or nondeductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

 53 

in the normal course of business we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world we are subject to federal income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 and are under us federal income tax examination for the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 we are subject to state income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 we are also subject to examinations in other major foreign jurisdictions including singapore and israel for all years beginning from the calendar year ended december 31 2012 we are under audit in germany related to orbotech for the years ended december 31 2013 to december 31 2015 although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

in may 2017 orbotech received an assessment from the ita with respect to its fiscal years 2012 through 2014 the “assessment” and the “audit period” respectively for an aggregate amount of tax against us after offsetting all nols for tax purposes available through the end of 2014 of approximately nis 218 million approximately 610 million as of june 30 2019  which amount includes related interest and linkage differentials to the israeli consumer price index as of date of the assessment we believe our recorded unrecognized tax benefits are sufficient to cover the resolution of the assessment 

on august 31 2018 orbotech filed an objection in respect of the tax assessment the “objection” orbotech is now in the process of the second stage in which the claims raised by it in the objection are examined by different personnel at the israel tax authority “ita” in addition the ita can examine additional items and may assess additional amounts in the second stage the second stage must be completed within one year of when the objection was filed 

liquidity and capital resources 



cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

as of june 30 2019  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 174 billion  which represents a decrease of 114 billion  from june 30 2018  the decrease is mainly due to 182 billion paid to fund orbotech and other business acquisitions payment of dividends and dividend equivalents of 4723 million  and stock repurchases of 110 billion  partially offset by the net proceeds from our 2019 senior notes of 118 billion  our cash generated from operations of 115 billion  and net proceeds of 7642 million from marketable securities transactions as of june 30 2019  6693 million  of our 174 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices we currently intend to indefinitely reinvest 3791 million  of the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries for which we assert that earnings are permanently reinvested if however a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the united states we would be required to accrue and pay state and foreign taxes of approximately 122 of the funds repatriated the amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated we have accrued state and foreign tax on the remaining cash of 2902 million  of the 6693 million  held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices as such these funds can be returned to the us without accruing any additional us tax expense 

 54 

cash dividends and special cash dividend 

the total amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal years ended june 30 2019  2018  and 2017  was 4694 million  3956 million  and 3354 million  respectively the increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from 059  to 075  per share that were instituted during the three months ended june 30 2018 the amount of accrued dividend equivalents payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested restricted stock units “rsus” with dividend equivalent rights was 73 million  and 67 million  as of june 30 2019  and 2018  respectively these amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested rsus as described in note 9 “equity longterm incentive compensation plans and noncontrolling interest” to our consolidated financial statements 

on august 1 2019 we announced that our board of directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of 075 per share refer to note 19 “subsequent events” to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the declaration of our quarterly cash dividend announced subsequent to june 30 2019 

on november 19 2014 our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of 1650 per share on our outstanding common stock the declaration and payment of the special cash dividend was part of our leveraged recapitalization transaction under which the special cash dividend was financed through a combination of existing cash and proceeds from the debt financing disclosed in note 8 “debt” that was completed during the three  months ended december 31 2014  the total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by us at the declaration date was substantially paid out during the three  months ended december 31 2014  except for the aggregate special cash dividend of 430 million that was accrued for the unvested rsus and to be paid when such underlying unvested rsus vest during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 all of the special cash dividends accrued with respect to outstanding rsus were vested and paid in full we paid a special cash dividend with respect to vested restricted stock units during the fiscal years ended june 30 2019  2018  and 2017  of 29 million  64 million  and 86 million  respectively other than the special cash dividend declared during the three  months ended december 31 2014  we historically have not declared any special cash dividend for details of the special cash dividend refer to note 9 “equity longterm incentive compensation plans and noncontrolling interest” to our consolidated financial statements 

stock repurchases 

the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended june 30 2019  and 2018  the stock repurchase program is intended in part to offset shares issued in connection with the purchases under our employee stock purchase plan “espp” program and the vesting of employee restricted stock units 

fiscal year 2019  compared to fiscal year 2018 

cash flows from operating activities 

we have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  decreased by 765 million compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  from 123 billion  to 115 billion  primarily as a result of the following factors 

 these trends were partially offset by a decrease in income tax payments of 727 million and an increase in collections of approximately 100 million 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  was 118 billion  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 2916 million  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  this increase was mainly due to 182 billion paid to fund orbotech and other acquisitions an increase in capital expenditures of 636 million partially offset by higher net sales and maturities of marketable securities of 3888 million 

 55 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  from 127 billion  to 3600 million  this change was mainly impacted by net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in march 2019 of 118 billion  partially offset by an increase in common stock repurchases of 8920 million and an increase in dividend and dividend equivalent payments of 702 million due to an increase in our quarterly dividend from 059 to 075 per share 

senior notes 

in march 2019 and november 2014 we issued 120 billion  and 250 billion  respectively each a “2019 senior notes” a “2014 senior notes” and collectively the “senior notes” aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes 

the interest rate specified for each series of the 2014 senior notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if moody’s investor service inc “moody’s” or standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” or under certain circumstances a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for moody’s or sp as the case may be a “substitute rating agency” downgrades or subsequently upgrades its rating assigned to the respective series of the 2014 senior notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade unlike the 2014 senior notes the interest rate for each series of the 2019 senior notes will not be subject to such adjustments during the three months ended june 30 2018 we entered into a series of forward contracts the “2018 rate lock agreements” to lock the benchmark interest rate with notional amount of 5000 million in aggregate in october 2014 we entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10year treasury rate “benchmark rate” on a portion of the 2014 senior notes with a notional amount of 100 billion  in aggregate for additional details refer to note 17 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” and note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

the original discounts on the 2019 senior notes and the 2014 senior notes amounted to 67 million  and 40 million  respectively and are being amortized over the life of the debt interest is payable semiannually  on may 1 and november 1 of each year for the 2014 senior notes and semiannually on march 15 and september 15 of each year for the 2019 senior notes the indenture for the senior notes the “indenture” includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of senior notes by at least two of moody’s sp and fitch inc unless we have exercised our rights to redeem the senior notes of such series we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or at the holder’s option any part of each holder’s senior notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below the “change of control offer” in the change of control offer we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of senior notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any on the senior notes repurchased up to but not including the date of repurchase 

as of june 30 2019  we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the indenture associated with the senior notes 

revolving credit facility 

in november 2017 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” providing for a 7500 million  fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” which replaced our prior credit facility subject to the terms of the credit agreement the revolving credit facility may be increased in an amount up to 2500 million  in the aggregate in november 2018 we entered into an incremental facility extension and amendment agreement the “amendment” which amends the credit agreement to a extend the maturity date the “maturity date” from november 30 2022 to november 30 2023 b increase the total commitment by 2500 million and c effect certain other amendments to the credit agreement as set forth in the amendment after giving effect to the amendment the total commitments under the credit agreement are 100 billion during the third quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2019  we made borrowings of 9000 million  from the revolving credit facility as part of the funding for the orbotech acquisition which were paid in full in the same quarter as of june 30 2019  we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

we may borrow repay and reborrow funds under the revolving credit facility until the maturity date at which time such revolving credit facility will terminate and all outstanding loans under such facility together with all accrued and unpaid interest must be repaid we may prepay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at any time without a prepayment penalty 

 56 

borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at our option at either i the alternative base rate “abr” plus a spread which ranges from 0 bps  to 75 bps  or ii the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a spread which ranges from 100 bps  to 175 bps  the spreads under abr and libor are subject to adjustment in conjunction with credit rating downgrades or upgrades we are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility which ranges from 10 bps  to 25 bps  subject to an adjustment in conjunction with changes to our credit rating as of june 30 2019  we pay an annual commitment fee of 125 bps  on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility 

the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the credit agreement on a quarterly basis covering the trailing four  consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 350  to 100  in addition we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the credit agreement on a quarterly basis of 300  to 100  covering the trailing four  consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter which can be increased to 400  to 100  for a period of time in connection with a material acquisition or a series of material acquisitions as of june 30 2019  we elected to increase the maximum allowed leverage ratio to 400 to 100 following the orbotech acquisition 

we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement as of june 30 2019  the interest expense coverage ratio was 1427 to 100 and the leverage ratio was 180 to 100 considering our current liquidity position shortterm financial forecasts and ability to prepay the revolving credit facility if necessary we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our fiscal year ending june 30 2020  

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june 30 2019    



 



 57 

 we have adopted a cashbased longterm incentive “cash lti” program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program cash lti awards issued to employees under the cash longterm incentive plan “cash lti plan” generally vest in three or four equal installments for additional details refer to note 9 “equity longterm incentive compensation plans and noncontrolling interest” to our consolidated financial statements 

we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we periodically sell certain letters of credit “lcs” without recourse received from customers in payment for goods and services 

the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lcs for the indicated periods 



factoring and lc fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense income net and were not material for the periods presented 

we maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to 508 million  of which 447 million  had been issued as of june 30 2019  primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for valueadded tax “vat” and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in europe israel and asia 

 58 

working capital 

working capital was 255 billion  as of june 30 2019  which represents a decrease of 7881 million  compared to our working capital as of june 30 2018  as of june 30 2019  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 174 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity may be affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business spending for business acquisitions and other factors such as uncertainty in the global and regional economies and the semiconductor semiconductorrelated and electronic device industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our 100 billion revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs capital expenditures cash dividends stock repurchases and other contractual obligations including repayment of outstanding debt for at least the next 12 months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position as of june 30 2019  actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2019  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 8135 million these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of june 30 2019  the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by 43 million 

in march 2019 and november 2014 we issued 120 billion  and 250 billion  respectively each a “2019 senior notes” a “2014 senior notes” and collectively the “senior notes” aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior unsecured longterm notes the fair market value of longterm fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of june 30 2019  the fair value and the book value of our senior notes were 370 billion  and 345 billion  respectively due in various fiscal years ranging from 2020 to 2049 additionally the interest expense for the 2014 senior notes is subject to interest rate adjustments following a downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies following a rating change below investment grade the stated interest rate for each series of the 2014 senior notes may increase between 25 bps to 100 bps based on the adjusted credit rating refer to note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “liquidity and capital resources”  in part ii item 7 for additional details factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor semiconductorrelated and electronics industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy as of june 30 2019  if our credit rating was downgraded below investment grade by moody’s and sp the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense on the 2014 senior notes considering a 200 bps increase to the stated interest rate for each series of our 2014 senior notes is estimated to be approximately 417 million unlike the 2014 senior notes the interest rate for each series of the 2019 senior notes will not be subject to such adjustments 

in november 2017 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” for a 7500 million fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” which replaced our prior credit agreement subject to the terms of the credit agreement the revolving credit facility may be increased in an amount up to 2500 million in the aggregate in november 2018 we entered into an incremental facility extension and amendment agreement the “amendment” which amends the credit agreement to a extend the maturity date the “maturity date” from november 30 2022 to november 30 2023 b increase the total commitment by 2500 million and c effect certain other amendments to the credit agreement as set forth in the amendment after giving effect to the amendment the total commitments under the credit agreement are 100 billion as of june 30 2019  we do not have any outstanding floating rate debts that are subject to an increase in interest rates we are obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 125 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility which is subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades the annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility depending upon the then effective credit rating as of june 30 2019  if our credit ratings were downgraded to be below investment grade the maximum potential increase to our annual commitment fee for the revolving credit facility using the highest range of the ranges discussed above is estimated to be approximately 08 million

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by rule 13a15d and 15d15d of the exchange act that occurred during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

industry 

general background 

klatencor’s core focus is the semiconductor industry the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is typically 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish other more specialized wafers such as epitaxial silicon “epi” silicon on insulator “soi” gallium nitride “gan” and silicon carbide “sic” are also common in the semiconductor industry 

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper “interconnect” structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when all of the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality the wafer is then cut into individual chips and those chips that passed functional testing are packaged final testing is performed on all packaged chips 

current trends 

the semiconductor equipment industry is currently experiencing growth from multiple drivers such as demand for chips providing computational power and connectivity for artificial intelligence “ai” applications and continued need for chips from leading edge foundry and logic chip manufacturers that support mobile devices qualification of early extreme ultraviolet “euv” lithography processes and equipment is driving growth at leading logicfoundry and dynamic randomaccess memory “dram” manufacturers expansion of the internet of things “iot” together with increasing acceptance of advanced driver assistance systems “adas” that support the introduction of autonomous cars have begun to accelerate legacynode technology conversions and capacity expansions intertwined in these areas spurred by data storage and connectivity needs is the growth in demand for memory chips finally china is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ics government initiatives are propelling china to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting semiconductor manufacturers from taiwan korea japan and the us china is currently seen as an important longterm growth region for the semiconductor capital equipment sector 

supporting this multisegmented market growth the semiconductor industry continues to introduce numerous technology changes new techniques and architectures in production today include three dimensional finfet transistors three dimensional flash memory “3d nand” design technology cooptimization “dtco” advanced patterning technologies including selfaligned multiple patterning and euv lithography and packaging klatencor’s inspection metrology and data analytic technologies play key roles in enabling our customers to develop and manufacture advanced semiconductor devices to support these trends 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to high volume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trends such as a specific design rule shrink today the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies some requiring new substrate and film materials new geometries advanced multipatterning and euv lithography and packaging techniques while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected the adoption of these technologies into full volume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects and device performance characteristics namely speed capacity or power management become more sensitive to parameters such as linewidth and film thickness variation new process materials such as photoresists for euv lithography require extensive characterization before they can be used in the

manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 500 billion substantially more than previousgeneration facilities in addition chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment 

by developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and improve their return on investment “roi” once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume our systems help ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution in addition the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules coupled with new materials and device innovation has increased inprocess variability which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling 

klatencor systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer reticle and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems the ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes this helps them increase their yield of highperformance parts and deliver their products to market faster—thus maximizing their profits with our broad portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ nextgeneration products helping our customers respond to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architectures more demanding lithography processes and new packaging techniques

customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout asia the united states and europe staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers in each of these regions 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2018  2017  and 2016  the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues 

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it has historically been cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy as well as customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are aimed at building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services our customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility which are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier for multiple products and services our revenues are derived primarily from product sales mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in asia the united states and europe we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2018  we employed approximately 2420 fulltime sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of subsidiaries or branches in other countries including china germany israel japan singapore korea and taiwan international revenues accounted for approximately 88  86  and 82  of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended june 30 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 17 “segment reporting and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

 10 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in nonus dollar product sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in item 1a “risk factors” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our shipment backlog for systems and associated warranty totaled 156 billion and 146 billion as of june 30 2018  and 2017  respectively and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received and the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months orders for service contracts and unreleased products are excluded from shipment backlog all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer often with limited or no penalties we make adjustments for shipment backlog obtained from acquired companies sales order cancellations customer delivery date changes and currency adjustments shipment backlog is not subject to normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our consolidated financial statements in addition the concept of shipment backlog is not defined in the accounting literature making comparisons between periods and with other companies difficult and potentially misleading 

our revenue backlog which includes the gross value of sales orders where physical deliveries have been completed but for which revenue has not been recognized pursuant to our policy for revenue recognition totaled 4150 million and 3280 million as of june 30 2018  and 2017  respectively orders for service contracts are excluded from revenue backlog 

because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods the historical cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between on the one hand our ability to manufacture deliver and install products and on the other the requirements of our customers in our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources management of our operating model and other factors we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries and installations of products which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products 

research and development 

the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs in addition we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby certain government agencies or other third parties fund a portion of our research and development costs as of june 30 2018  we employed approximately 1720 fulltime research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  involved the development of process control and yield management equipment aimed at addressing the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes and new packaging techniques for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

 11 

the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product research and development even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to enhance our competitive position new product introductions however may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products and if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in the united states milpitas california singapore israel germany and china as of june 30 2018  we employed approximately 1150 fulltime manufacturing personnel 

some critical parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications while other parts are standard commercial products we use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers through our business interruption planning we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by among other things monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources or disruptions within our suppliers’ oftencomplex supply chains could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors such as applied materials inc asml holding nv hitachi hightechnologies corporation nanometrics inc and rudolph technologies inc some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability interoperability with the existing installed base and technical service and support as well as overall cost of ownership 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

 12 

acquisitions and alliances 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment including without limitation the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial condition results of operations or competitive position 

however any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of june 30 2018  we employed approximately 6550 fulltime employees except for our employees in belgium where a trade union delegation has been recognized and our employees in the german operations of our mie business unit who are represented by employee works council none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees

risk factors 

tableend a description of factors that could materially affect our business financial condition or operating results is provided below 

risks associated with our industry 

ongoing changes in the technology industry as well as the semiconductor industry in particular could expose our business to significant risks 

the semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve pricing trends in the endmarkets for consumer electronics and other products which place a growing emphasis on our customers’ cost of ownership changes in our customers’ capital spending patterns and in general an environment of constant change and development including decreasing product and component dimensions use of new materials and increasingly complex device structures applications and process steps if we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends or with respect to technological advances if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry as the significant majority of our sales are made to semiconductor manufacturers some of the trends that our management monitors in operating our business include the following 

 any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers’ rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce which could result in downward pressure on our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

 16 

we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been highly concentrated due to corporate consolidation acquisitions and business closures in this environment orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales this increasing concentration exposes our business financial condition and operating results to a number of risks including the following 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 17 

the semiconductor equipment industry has been cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict the historically cyclical nature of the primary industry in which we operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization consumer demand for products inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in or cancellation or delay of orders which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customer’s funding status which could be weakened not only by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or companyspecific reasons but also by funding limitations imposed by the customer’s unique organizational structure any of these factors could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results then our business could be seriously harmed furthermore any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

in addition our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics which when made are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time however largely due to the historical cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles our actual results may vary and have varied in the past from forecasted results these variations can occur for any number of reasons including but not limited to unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders product shipments or product acceptance an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to adapt to changing business conditions or a different than anticipated effective tax rate the impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment this is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues but also due to the advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order to meet the expected lead times to significant inventory writeoffs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided we provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of management’s expectations for the future but those reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of and are themselves forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this item 1a and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements if our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts or if we revise our forecasts the market price of our common stock could decline 

 18 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver appears to be slowing which may cause semiconductor manufacturers to delay investments in equipment investigate more complex device architectures use new materials and develop innovative fabrication processes these and other evolving customer plans and needs require us to respond with continued development programs and cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards develop and introduce new products and solutions that successfully address changing customer needs win market acceptance of these new products and solutions and manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner our failure to accurately predict evolving industry standards and develop as well as offer competitive technology solutions in a timely manner with costeffective products could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance features and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

in addition the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks we regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer even before receiving the customer’s formal acceptance of that product in certain situations including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted however our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents all of which must perform to their respective specifications so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall product’s required specifications in such a situation the customer may be entitled to certain remedies which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and as a result our stock price 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of inspection products as a result any delay or reduction of sales of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results the continued customer demand for these products and the development introduction and market acceptance of new products and technologies are critical to our future success 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business in addition we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects the termination of any such collaboration or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration could significantly impair our research and development efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations 

 19 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of continuing significant investments in product research and development however we may enter new markets whether through acquisitions or new internal product development in which competition is based primarily on product pricing not technological superiority further some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing through our business interruption planning we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by among other things monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers certain key parts are available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers also key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers’ proprietary intellectual property in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for highperformance hightechnology components which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products in addition if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations which is a heightened risk during economic downturns it could affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products similarly especially with respect to suppliers of hightechnology components our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in a timely manner and result in delays for our products our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms furthermore a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons including the supplier’s financial condition or business operational decisions which would require us to purchase in a single transaction a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers such “endoflife” parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory writeoff either of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods 

 20 

if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan our operating results business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted 

we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually revised frequently generally quarterly and reviewed by management even more frequently at least monthly our business plan is developed based on a number of factors many of which require estimates and assumptions such as our expectations of the economic environment future business levels our customers’ willingness and ability to place orders leadtimes and future revenue and cash flow our budgeted operating expenses for example are based in part on our future revenue expectations however our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors including the volatile and historically cyclical nature of our primary industry customer order cancellations macroeconomic changes operational matters regarding particular agreements our ability to manage customer deliveries the availability of resources for the installation of our products delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a 

because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results similarly if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period which would also negatively affect our results of operations if we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted such an outcome could cause customers suppliers or investors to view us as less stable or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates any of which could have an adverse impact on our stock price 

in addition our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources the need to manage our operating model and other factors in furtherance of those efforts we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries installations and payment scheduling any such decisions may impact our ability to recognize revenue including the fiscal period during which such revenue may be recognized with respect to such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or stock price 

our capital structure is highly leveraged 

as of june 30 2018  we had 225 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes additionally we have commitments for an unfunded revolving credit facility of 7500 million  under the credit agreement we may incur additional indebtedness in the future by accessing the unfunded portion of our revolving credit facility andor entering into new financing arrangements for example at the same time we announced our intention to acquire orbotech we also announced a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase up to 200 billion of our common stock a large portion of which would be financed with new indebtedness our ability to pay interest and repay the principal of our current indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations our credit rating the ongoing interest rate environment and the other risk factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in addition the interest rates of the senior unsecured longterm notes may be subject to adjustments from time to time if moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” or under certain circumstances a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for moody’s or sp as the case may be a “substitute rating agency” downgrades or subsequently upgrades its rating assigned to the respective series of notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade accordingly changes by moody’s sp or a substitute rating agency to the rating of any series of notes our outlook or credit rating could require us to pay additional interest which may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline factors that can affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position including the incurrence of additional indebtedness and our business strategy 

 21 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of notes by at least two of moody’s sp and fitch inc unless we have exercised our right to redeem the notes of such series we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or at the holder’s option any part of each holder’s notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below the “change of control offer” in the change of control offer we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any on the notes repurchased up to but not including the date of repurchase we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of that series of notes our ability to repurchase that series of notes in such event may be limited by law by the indenture associated with that series of notes or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time if we fail to repurchase that series of notes as required by the terms of such notes it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing that series of notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate and an increase in interest rates would require us to pay additional interest on any borrowings which may have an adverse effect on the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline the interest rate under our revolving credit facility is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades additionally under our revolving credit facility we are required to comply with affirmative and negative covenants which include the maintenance of certain financial ratios the details of which can be found in note 7 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

 if we fail to comply with these covenants we will be in default and our borrowings will become immediately due and payable there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time in addition certain of our domestic subsidiaries are required to guarantee our borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the event that we default on our borrowings these domestic subsidiaries shall be liable for our borrowings which could disrupt our operations and result in a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

our leveraged capital structure may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and net income per share 

our issuance and maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to 

 our ability to satisfy our future expenses as well as our new debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our future operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our future expenses and service our new debt obligations which may impact our ability to manage our capital structure to preserve and maintain our investment grade rating if our future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows we may need to access the unfunded portion of our revolving credit facility of 7500 million  or enter into new financing arrangements to obtain necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms any additional borrowing under our revolving credit facility will place further pressure on us to comply with the financial covenants if we fail to make a payment associated with our debt obligations we could be in default on such debt and such a default could cause us to be in default on our other obligations 

 22 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors first instituted a quarterly dividend during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 since that time we have announced a number of increases in the amount of our quarterly dividend level as well as payment of a special cash dividend that was declared and substantially paid in the second quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30 2015 we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends may be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws changes to our business model and our increased interest and principal payments required by our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions including our indemnification of third parties as well as the performance of our products 

although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties costly and timeconsuming litigation or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes or could impact our revenue or cost recognition any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in our commercial agreements from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers suppliers and lessors with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes in addition notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations whether or not asserted due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects especially when products are first introduced unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us including increased service or warranty costs providing product replacements for or modifications to defective products litigation related to defective products reimbursement for damages caused by our products product recalls or product writeoffs or disposal costs these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business financial condition and operating results in addition our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

 23 

furthermore we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives such as credits toward future purchases we believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our longterm business as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase higher volumes of our products however these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives our volume purchase agreements require significant estimation for the amounts to be accrued depending upon the estimate of volume of future purchases as such we are required to update our estimates of the accruals on a periodic basis until the earnings process is complete our estimates could differ in comparison to actuals as a result these volume purchase arrangements while expected to be beneficial to our business over time could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in nearterm periods including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and therefore our gross margins 

in addition we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customerspecific commitments on pricing tool reliability spare parts stocking levels response time and other commitments furthermore we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection to date we have made no significant accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in supporting an audit or inspection or defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

there are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development 

we are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies both domestically and internationally governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion or a project may be terminated by mutual agreement if the parties determine that the project’s goals or milestones are not being achieved so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future in addition under the terms of these government grants the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur directly and indirectly in connection with such programs any such audit could result in modifications to or even termination of the applicable government funding program for example if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program those costs would not be reimbursed and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded we do not know the outcome of any future audits any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties financial or otherwise termination of funding programs suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency any of which could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our business 

historically we recorded material restructuring charges related to our prior global workforce reductions large excess inventory writeoffs and material impairment charges related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans or do so within the expected time frame if we again restructure our organization and business processes implement additional cost reduction actions or discontinue certain business operations we may take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to among other things employee terminations or exit costs we may also be required to writeoff additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline also as our lead times from suppliers increase due to the increasing complexity of the parts and components they provide and the lead times demanded by our customers decrease due to the time pressures they face when introducing new products or technology or bringing new facilities into production we may be compelled to increase our commitments and therefore our risk exposure to inventory purchases to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner and that inventory may need to be writtenoff if demand for the underlying product declines for any reason such additional writeoffs could result in material charges 

 24 

in the past we recorded a material charge related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives based on economic benefit if known or using the straightline method and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for longlived assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and as applicable the amount of any previous impairment charge could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge 

any such additional material charges whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements 

we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements 

we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions any of which may prove not to be financially viable if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables however by entering into these arrangements and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services we are exposed to additional risks if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered 

in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws if we were to violate any such law we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general commercial operational financial and regulatory risks 

we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy 

the markets for semiconductors and therefore our business are ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending which caused our customers to decrease cancel or delay their equipment and service orders from us in the economic slowdown during fiscal year 2009 in addition the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell reduced demand combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of such financing has at times in the past adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels 

 25 

in addition a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and where applicable credit ratings a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity if the market value of such investments were to decline or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges including but not limited to 

 any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

 26 

we might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property or other confidential information that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information in addition we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties with respect to intellectual property infringement disputes our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition furthermore we may potentially be subject to claims by customers suppliers or other business partners or by governmental law enforcement agencies related to our receipt distribution andor use of thirdparty intellectual property or confidential information legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit and associated internal investigations with respect to intellectual property or confidential information disputes are often expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert management’s attention and other company resources andor may result in restrictions on our ability to sell our products settlements on significantly adverse terms or adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines any of which could have a significant negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings claims or investigations the instigation of legal proceedings or claims our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims or the determination of any adverse findings against us or any of our employees in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our business reputation 

we are exposed to various risks related to the legal regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to compliance with new existing different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust anticorruptionantibribery unclaimed property and export control regulations our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws rules or regulations or changes to existing laws rules or regulations including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business from time to time we may receive inquiries or audit notices from governmental or regulatory bodies or we may participate in voluntary disclosure programs related to legal regulatory or tax compliance matters and these inquiries notices or programs may result in significant financial cost including investigation expenses defense costs assessments and penalties reputational harm and other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations including those that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental regulations including regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute potentially more expensive andor rarer materials further we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by any release regardless of fault we also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the materials composition of our products including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources of certain metals and other materials the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business 

 27 

in addition we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment immigration contracts product performance product liability antitrust environmental regulations securities unfair competition and other matters these legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit our ability to sell our products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims which could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our current and future needs our business and operations could be harmed 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation information systems management and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting and procurement functions to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations in addition many of these outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage employ cloud computing technology for such storage these providers’ cloud computing systems may be susceptible to “cyber incidents” such as intentional cyber attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cybersecurity compromises which are outside of our control if we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as anticipated or do not adequately protect our data from cyberrelated security breaches or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes we may experience operational difficulties such as limitations on our ability to ship products increased costs manufacturing or service interruptions or delays loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data quality and compliance issues and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and cyber incidents 

in the conduct of our business we collect use transmit and store data on information systems this data includes confidential information transactional information and intellectual property belonging to us our customers and our business partners as well as personallyidentifiable information of individuals we allocate significant resources to network security data encryption and other measures to protect our information systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse despite our ongoing efforts to enhance our network security measures our information systems are susceptible to computer viruses cyberrelated security breaches and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions tampering misuse criminal acts including phishing or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate and are subject to the inherent vulnerabilities of network security measures we have experienced cyberrelated attacks in the past and may experience cyberrelated attacks in the future our security measures may also be breached due to employee errors malfeasance or otherwise third parties may also attempt to influence employees users suppliers or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our our customers’ or business partners’ data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to the information systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

any of such occurrences could result in disruptions to our operations misappropriation corruption or theft of confidential information including intellectual property and other critical data of klatencor our customers and other business partners misappropriation of funds and company assets reduced value of our investments in research development and engineering litigation with or payment of damages to third parties reputational damage costs to comply with regulatory inquiries or actions data privacy issues costs to rebuild our internal information systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs 

 28 

we carry insurance that provides some protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident but it will not likely cover all such losses and the losses that it does not cover may be significant 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact our business operations 

our global operations are dependent upon certain information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications system failures or malfunctioning such as difficulties with our customer relationship management “crm” system could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results our enterprise resource planning “erp” system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records record transactions provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems whether in connection with the regular operation periodic enhancements modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort in march 2018 we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire orbotech we may also enter into definitive agreements for and consummate acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than anticipated in addition we may lose key employees of the acquired companies as a result risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons including 

 at times we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary highly sensitive information the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

 29 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations or in the operations of our customers due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states singapore israel germany and china in addition our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors as well as our other operations and those of our customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fire earthquake volcanic eruptions energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites we cannot ensure that alternate means of conducting our operations whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if such alternate means were available they could be obtained on favorable terms 

in addition as part of our costcutting actions we have consolidated several operating facilities our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above such as acts of war or terrorism earthquakes fires or other natural disasters if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at or acts of war in the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business increased international political instability in various parts of the world disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations we maintain significant manufacturing and research and development operations in israel an area that has historically experienced a high degree of political instability and we are therefore exposed to risks associated with future instability in that region such instability could directly impact our ability to operate our business or our customers’ ability to operate their businesses in the affected region cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate such instability could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we selfinsure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain risks are uninsurable are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance accordingly we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds the applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy for example we do not currently hold earthquake insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations a significant portion of which are conducted in california an area highly susceptible to earthquakes it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products much of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we selfinsure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also selfinsured either based on a similar costbenefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

 30 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the japanese yen and the euro we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally in addition an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the united states and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected furthermore if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge we may experience material financial losses 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments impairment of our investments could harm our earnings in addition we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that are susceptible to changes in market interest rates and bond yields as market interest rates and bond yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss we believe we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity however an impairment of the fair market value of our investments even if unrealized must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

in addition the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets our operating results or other performance metrics any perception that we might be unable to complete the merger with orbotech material delays in our ability to complete the merger with orbotech or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies 

we are exposed to risks in connection with tax and regulatory compliance audits in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits such as related to customs or product safety requirements in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes penalties fines or other prohibitions against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that our products and practices comply with applicable regulations the final determination of any such audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals related to income taxes and other contingencies the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

we earn profits in and are therefore potentially subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions including singapore israel and the cayman islands the countries in which we earn the majority of our nonus profits due to economic political or other conditions tax rates in those jurisdictions may be subject to significant change a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in the tax rates imposed by those jurisdictions expiration of tax holidays in certain jurisdictions that are not renewed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in stockbased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes a change in our effective tax rate can materially and adversely impact our results from operations for example as a consequence of the newly enacted tax cuts and jobs act “the act” foreign earnings are now deemed to be repatriated which resulted in a higher effective tax rate for the company’s fiscal year ending june 30 2018 

 31 

in addition recent changes to us tax laws will significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings numerous countries are evaluating their existing tax laws due in part to recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd’s” base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project to address the impact of the recent us tax law changes we recorded a provisional tax amount of 3396 million  for the transitional tax liability and recorded a provisional tax amount of 1021 million  to remeasure certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of the act these provisional tax amounts recorded are based on our reasonable estimate until we fully complete our assessment and we may need additional information to complete our assessment we are still evaluating the tax provisions related to global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” and we have not made a policy election on how to account for the gilti provisions of the act as allowed by the us generally accepted accounting standards our selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new gilti tax rules will depend in part on analyzing our global income to determine whether we expect to have future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti and if so what the impact is expected to be also the recent us tax law changes are subject to further interpretations from the us federal and state governments and regulatory organizations such as treasury department andor irs and this could change the provisional tax liability or the accounting treatment of the provisional tax liability based on updated guidance and interpretations a significant portion of the additional provisions for income taxes we have made due to the enactment of the act is payable by us over a period of up to eight years as a result our cash flows from operating activities will be adversely impacted until the additional tax provisions are paid in full 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements has become increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices or changes in interpretations of such standards practices or rules can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting standards and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future changes to or revised interpretations or applications of existing accounting standards or tax rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business for example in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an accounting standard update regarding revenue from contracts with customers and in february 2016 the fasb issued an accounting standard update which amends the existing accounting standards for leases adoption of new standards may require changes to our processes accounting systems and internal controls difficulties encountered during adoption could result in internal control deficiencies or delay the reporting of our financial results in addition the passing of the act in december 2017 caused us to significantly increase our provision for income taxes which had a material adverse effect on our net income for the year ended june 30 2018 further interpretations of the act from the government and regulatory organizations may change our tax expense provided for our transitional tax liability and deferred tax adjustments as well as our provision liability or accounting treatment of the provisional liability which may potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts

risks related to our pending acquisition of orbotech 

if we are unable to complete our contemplated acquisition of orbotech our expected financial results and the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected 

on march 18 2018 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire orbotech consummation of the acquisition is subject to customary conditions to closing including the receipt of required regulatory approvals if any condition to the closing of the acquisition is not satisfied or waived the acquisition will not be completed we and orbotech also may terminate the acquisition agreement under certain circumstances any or all of the preceding could jeopardize our ability to consummate the acquisition on the already negotiated terms to the extent the acquisition is not completed for any reason we would have devoted substantial resources and management attention to the transaction without realizing the accompanying benefits expected by our management and our financial condition and results of operations and the market value of our stock may be adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties associated with the acquisition include 

 even if the orbotech acquisition is consummated we may not be able to integrate the business of orbotech successfully with our own or realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

the acquisition involves the combination of two companies that currently operate as independent public companies the combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices with those of orbotech potential difficulties that the combined company may encounter as part of the integration process include the following 

 in addition we have operated and until the completion of the acquisition will continue to operate independently it is possible that the integration process could result in 

 

any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company 

 33 

the combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the acquisition of and the integration of orbotech 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the acquisition of and the integration of orbotech there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that may need to be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing marketing and benefits while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred there are many factors beyond our or their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses moreover many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings these integration expenses likely will result in the combined company taking charges against earnings following the completion of the acquisition and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present

management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements which involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured we derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems spare parts and services in general we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer when we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance we recognize revenue upon delivery and customer acceptance under certain circumstances however we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer as follows 

 in circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation 

in many instances products are sold in standalone arrangements services are sold separately through renewals of annual maintenance contracts we have multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period to determine the relative fair value of each element in a revenue arrangement we allocate arrangement consideration based on the selling price hierarchy for substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services we use vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” or thirdparty evidence “tpe” to allocate the selling price to each deliverable we determine tpe based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a standalone basis when we are unable to establish relative selling price using vsoe or tpe we use estimated selling price “esp” in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis esp could potentially be used for new or customized products we regularly review relative selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 

in a multiple element revenue arrangement we defer revenue recognition associated with the relative fair value of each undelivered element until that element is delivered to the customer to be considered a separate element the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting which means that such product or service must fulfill the following criteria a the delivered items has value to the customer on a standalone basis and b if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control if the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer 

 39 

tradein rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases we estimate the value of the tradein right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale this amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the tradein right or the expiration of the tradein right 

we enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers we accrue the estimated credits earned by our customers for such incentives and in situations when the credit levels vary depending upon sales volume we update our accrual based on the amount that we estimate will be purchased pursuant to the volume purchase agreements accruals for customer credits are recorded as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the parts have been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract including consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured 

we sell standalone software that is subject to software revenue recognition guidance we periodically review selling prices to determine whether vsoe exists and in situations where we are unable to establish vsoe for undelivered elements such as postcontract service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for 12  months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences 

the deferred system profit balance equals the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria less applicable product and warranty costs deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to certain customers in japan to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to such customers in japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance 

we enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units additionally judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or net realizable value net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value we review and set standard costs semiannually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

allowance for doubtful accounts  a majority of our accounts receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to record additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

 40 

accounting for stockbased compensation plans  we account for stockbased awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards the fair value of stockbased awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period the fair value for restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units the fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date the award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests ie the award holder is entitled to receive credits payable in cash or shares of our common stock equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award additionally we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimated amounts the fair value is determined using a blackscholes valuation model for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan the blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of assumptions including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the marketbased historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock 

contingencies and litigation  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” and note 14 “litigation and other legal matters” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

goodwill and intangible assets  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable longlived purchased intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable see note 6 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination we performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  and concluded that there was no impairment there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test the next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the third quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30 2019  

if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions we may be required to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment analysis in addition if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets we may be required to record goodwill andor intangible asset impairment charges in future periods whether in connection with our next annual impairment assessment or prior to that if any triggering event occurs outside of the quarter during which the annual goodwill impairment assessment is performed it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or if it does whether such charge would be material to our results of operations 

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires income tax effects for changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which the law is enacted 

transition tax liability is recognized in the period when the change in the us tax law was enacted and the income tax effects are recorded as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations the calculation of the transition tax liability includes assumptions and reasonable estimates of the income tax effects and are based on provisional tax amounts several inputs were considered in the calculation such as the calculation of the post1986 foreign earnings and profit “ep” income tax pools for all foreign subsidiaries and the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets we applied the current interpretations from the us federal and state governments and regulatory organization in our calculation of the transition tax liability and our reasonable estimate of the transition tax liability could change if further interpretations are provided for in the future we expect to fully complete our provisional transition tax liability calculation within the reasonable measurement period allowed by the authoritative guidance 

 41 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

valuation of marketable securities our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration of the investment the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment default and loss rates of the underlying collateral structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment

executive summary 

klatencor corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products and related service software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process from research and development to final volume production we provide leading edge equipment software and support that enable ic manufacturers to identify resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost in addition to serving the semiconductor industry we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries including advanced packaging light emitting diode  “ led ” power devices compound semiconductor and data storage industries as well as general materials research 

our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer ic lithography reticle “reticle” or “mask” and hard disk drive manufacturers around the world our products services and expertise are used by our customers to measure detect analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes our revenues are driven largely by our customers’ spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand or expansion plans our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets  memory foundry and logic all three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in enduser demand which influence the level and pattern of our customers’ spending on our products and services although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics communications data processing and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions particularly in the foundry and logic markets which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market 

as we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability as our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings in the global semiconductor related industries china is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ics government initiatives are propelling china to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting semiconductor manufacturers from taiwan korea japan and the us china is currently seen as an important longterm growth region for the semiconductor capital equipment sector we are also subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries the timing length intensity and volatility of the capacityoriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable 

the semiconductor industry has also been characterized by constant technological innovation currently there are multiple drivers for growth in the industry with increased demand for chips providing computation power and connectivity for artificial intelligence “ai” applications and support for mobile devices at the leading edge of foundry and logic chip manufacturing qualification of early extreme ultraviolet “euv” lithography processes and equipment is driving growth at leading logicfoundry and dynamic randomaccess memory “dram” manufacturers expansion of the internet of things “iot” together with increasing acceptance of advanced driver assistance systems “adas” in anticipation of the introduction of autonomous cars have begun to accelerate legacynode technology conversions and capacity expansions intertwined in these areas spurred by data storage and connectivity needs is the growth in demand for memory chips on the other hand higher design costs for the most advanced ics could economically constrain leadingedge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications we believe that over the long term our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications that fuel demand for process control equipment although the growth for such equipment may be adversely impacted by higher design costs for advanced ics reuse of installed products and delays in production ramps by our customers in response to higher costs and technical challenges at more advanced technology nodes 

 43 

the demand for our products and our revenue levels are driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate advanced ics that are incorporated into sophisticated mobile devices the timing for our customers in ordering and taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment is also determined by our customers’ requirements to meet the next generation production ramp schedules and the timing for capacity expansion to meet end customer demand our earnings will depend not only on our revenue levels but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers’ technology roadmaps we have maintained production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventoryrelated and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate over the past year our customers have taken delivery of higher volumes of process control equipment than they did in the previous year however any delay or push out by our customers in taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment may cause earnings volatility due to increases in the risk of inventory related charges as well as timing of revenue recognition 

the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years   



total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  increased by 16  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  our year over year revenue growth was primarily due to increases from sales of both our wafer inspection and patterning products as our customers continue to invest in process control and services and an increase in the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over this time period for our service revenues 

total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  increased by 17  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  our year over year revenue growth reflected increases from sales of both our inspection and metrology products as our customers continue to invest in process control and services increased revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  were also driven by strong demand from our foundry customers and an increase in the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over this time period for our service revenues 

proposed merger with orbotech ltd 

on march 18 2018  we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” with orbotech ltd “orbotech” pursuant to which we would acquire orbotech for 3886  in cash and 025  of a share of our common stock in exchange for each ordinary share of orbotech which at the time of announcement valued orbotech at 32  billion in enterprise value the merger contemplated by the merger agreement the “orbotech merger” is subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of the other customary closing conditions we intend to fund the cash portion of the purchase price with cash from the combined companys balance sheet 

in addition we announced a 2 billion share repurchase authorization the share repurchase program is targeted to be completed within 12 to 18 months following the close of this transaction we intend to raise approximately 1 billion in new longterm debt financing to complete the share repurchase

revenues and gross margin   



product revenues 

our business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles in the preceding period 

product revenues increased by 17 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  primarily due to growth in revenues from our customers in korea china and japan our year over year increase in our product revenues were primarily driven by increased investments from our memory and wafer customers for next generation technology as well as capacityrelated investments 

product revenues increased by 20 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  primarily due to growth in revenues from our customers in korea taiwan and europe  israel our year over year increase in our product revenues were primarily driven by strong demand for our inspection and metrology products increased investments by our foundry customers to support their new device architectures and and sales of our next generation inspection products 

service revenues 

service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period the amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems but it is also impacted by other factors such as our rate of service contract renewals the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended june 30 2016  2017  and 2018  primarily as a result of an increase over time in the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over that time period

a significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that trend to continue 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions 

the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage 

changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues it also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements this includes the impact of capacity utilization use of overtime and variability of cost structure changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk 

our gross margin increased to 641  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  from 630  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  primarily due to a favorable mix of products and services sold a higher revenue volume of products and services and lower customer support costs partially offset by higher manufacturing and service costs to support increased volume of product shipments

our gross margin increased to 630  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  from 610  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  primarily due to a higher revenue volume of products and services and a favorable mix of products and services sold partially offset by other service and manufacturing costs

rd expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our focused rd efforts that are aligned with our overall business strategy as technological innovation is essential to our success we may incur significant costs associated with rd projects including compensation for engineering talent engineering material costs and other expenses 

 47 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 390 million as a result of additional engineering headcount higher variable compensation and higher employee benefit costs and an increase in engineering materials and supplies expenses of 327 million

the increase in other expense income net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  was primarily due to an increase in interest income of 139 million and a decrease in accruals related to uncertain tax positions of 21 million partially offset by a decrease in net gains from our investments in privatelyheld companies of 16 million

provision for income taxes 

the following table provides details of income taxes 



our effective tax rate during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  was impacted by the tax cuts and jobs act “the act” which was enacted into law on december 22 2017 income tax effects resulting from changes in tax laws are accounted for by us in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that these tax effects be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted and the effects are recorded as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations we have not fully completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the act as a result we made an additional provision for income tax during the three months ended june 30 2018 relating to the enactment of the act 

this act includes significant changes to the us corporate income tax system which reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 350 to 210 as of january 1 2018 shifts to a modified territorial tax regime which requires companies to pay a transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings the decrease in the us federal corporate tax rate from 350 to 210 results in a blended statutory tax rate of 281  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  the new taxes for certain foreignsourced earnings under the act are effective for the company after the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 

tax expense was higher as a percentage of income before taxes during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  primarily due to the impact of the following items 



 49 

as of june 30 2018  we had not yet completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the act our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  is based in part on a reasonable estimate of the effects on its transition tax and existing deferred tax balances for the amounts which we were able to reasonably estimate we recognized a provisional tax amount of 4417 million  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  the provisional tax amount is included as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations the components of the provisional tax amounts are as follows 

 the act also includes provisions for global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations this income will effectively be taxed at a 105 tax rate in general as a result our deferred tax assets and liabilities are being evaluated if the deferred tax assets and liabilities should be recognized for the basis differences expected to reverse as a result of gilti provisions that are effective for us after the fiscal year ending june 30 2018 or should the tax on gilti provisions be recognized in the period the act was signed into law because of the complexity of the new provisions we are continuing to evaluate on how the provisions will be accounted for under the us generally accepted accounting principles wherein companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election of either i account for gilti as a component of tax expense in the period in which we are subject to the rules the “period cost method” or ii account for gilti in our measurement of deferred taxes the “deferred method” currently we have not elected a method and will only do so after our completion of the analysis of the gilti provisions and our election method will depend in part on analyzing our global income to determine whether we expect to have future us inclusions in our taxable income related to gilti and if so the impact that is expected 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income the amount of our pretax income as business activities fluctuate nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income the domestic manufacturing deduction nontaxable or nondeductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

in the normal course of business we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world we are under united states federal income tax examination for the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

liquidity and capital resources 



cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

as of june 30 2018  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 288 billion  which is a decrease of 1364 million  from june 30 2017  the decrease is mainly due to the payment of 9463 million  for senior notes term loans and the borrowed amount under the revolving credit facility payment of dividends and dividend equivalents of 4021 million  and stock repurchases of 2032 million  partially offset by our cash generated from operations proceeds from the revolving credit facility net of issuance costs of 2487 million and net proceeds from marketable securities of 3754 million as of june 30 2018  193 billion  of our 288 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices we have accrued us federal taxes under the tax cut and jobs act and can repatriate these funds without incurring any additional us federal tax other than if the us dollar value of the funds increase we currently intend to indefinitely reinvest 171 billion  of the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries if however a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the united states we would be required to accrue and pay state and foreign taxes of approximately 122 of the funds repatriated in addition to the transition tax liability already computed on such balances the amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated we have accrued state and foreign tax on the remaining cash of 2193 million  of the 193 billion  held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices as such these funds can be returned to the us without accruing any additional us tax expense 

cash dividends and special cash dividend 

the total amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal years ended june 30 2018  2017  and 2016  was 3956 million  3354 million  and 3245 million  respectively the increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from 054  to 059  per share and from 059  to 075  per share that were instituted during the three months ended september 30 2017 and june 30 2018 respectively the amount of accrued dividends payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested restricted stock units with dividend equivalent rights was 67 million  and 48 million  as of june 30 2018  and 2017  respectively these amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested restricted stock units as described in note 8 “equity and longterm incentive compensation plans” 

on august 2 2018 we announced that our board of directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of 075 per share refer to note 19 “subsequent events” to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the declaration of our quarterly cash dividend announced subsequent to june 30 2018 

on november 19 2014 we declared a special cash dividend of 1650  per share on our outstanding common stock which was paid on december 9 2014 to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on december 1 2014 additionally in connection with the special cash dividend our board of directors and our compensation committee of our board of directors approved a proportionate and equitable adjustment to outstanding equity awards restricted stock units and stock options under the 2004 equity incentive plan the “2004 plan” as required by the 2004 plan subject to the vesting requirements of the underlying awards as the adjustment was required by the 2004 plan the adjustment to the outstanding awards did not result in 

 51 

any incremental compensation expense due to modification of such awards under the authoritative guidance the declaration and payment of the special cash dividend was part of our leveraged recapitalization transaction under which the special cash dividend was financed through a combination of existing cash and proceeds from the debt financing disclosed in note 7 “debt” that was completed during the three  months ended december 31 2014  as of the declaration date the total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by us was approximately 276 billion  substantially all of which was paid out during the three  months ended december 31 2014  except for the aggregate special cash dividend of 430 million that was accrued for the unvested restricted stock units as of june 30 2018  and 2017  we had 28 million  and 90 million  respectively of accrued dividends payable for the special cash dividend with respect to outstanding unvested restricted stock units which will be paid when such underlying unvested restricted stock units vest we paid a special cash dividend with respect to vested restricted stock units during the fiscal years ended june 30 2018  2017  and 2016  of 64 million  86 million  and 218 million  respectively other than the special cash dividend declared during the three  months ended december 31 2014  we historically have not declared any special cash dividend 

stock repurchases 

the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended june 30 2018  and 2017  the stock repurchase program is intended in part to offset shares issued in connection with the purchases under our espp program and the vesting of employee restricted stock units 

fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017 

cash flows from operating activities

net cash provided by investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  was 2916 million  compared to net cash used by investing activities of 5609 million  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  the change primarily resulted from net purchases of marketable securities of 4928 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  compared to net liquidation of marketable securities of 3754 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  

cash flows from financing activities

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  from 7597 million  to 108 billion  primarily as a result of the following key factors

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  from 6367 million  to 4728 million  primarily as a result of a decrease in common stock repurchases of 1567 million and the impact of our early adoption of the new accounting standard update for sharebased payment awards to employees on a prospective basis during the year ended june 30 2017  this new standard no longer requires the excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation to be shown as a cash inflow from financing activities resulting in a change of 119 million from the year ended june 30 2016  

senior notes 

in november 2014 we issued 250 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes collectively referred to as “senior notes” we issued the senior notes as part of the leveraged recapitalization plan under which the proceeds from the senior notes in conjunction with the proceeds from the term loans described below and cash on hand were used x to fund a special cash dividend of 1650  per share aggregating to approximately 276 billion  y to redeem 7500 million  of 2018 senior notes including associated redemption premiums accrued interest and other fees and expenses and z for other general corporate purposes including repurchases of shares pursuant to our stock repurchase program the interest rate specified for each series of the senior notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if moody’s investor service inc “moody’s” or standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” or under certain circumstances a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for moody’s or sp as the case may be a “substitute rating agency” downgrades or subsequently upgrades its rating assigned to the respective series of senior notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade if the adjusted rating of any series of senior notes from moody’s or if applicable any substitute rating agency is decreased to ba1 ba2 ba3 or b1 or below the stated interest rate on such series of senior notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps 50 bps 75 bps or 100 bps respectively “bps” refers to basis points and 1 is equal to 100 bps if the rating of any series of senior notes from sp or if applicable any substitute rating agency with respect to such series of senior notes is decreased to bb bb bb or b or below the stated interest rate on such series of senior notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps 50 bps 75 bps or 100 bps respectively the interest rates on any series of senior notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any of moody’s 

 53 

sp and if applicable any substitute rating agency if such series of senior notes becomes rated “baa1” or its equivalent or higher by moody’s or if applicable any substitute rating agency and “bbb” or its equivalent or higher by sp or if applicable any substitute rating agency or one of those ratings if rated by only one of moody’s sp and if applicable any substitute rating agency in each case with a stable or positive outlook in october 2014 we entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10year treasury rate “benchmark rate” on a portion of the senior notes with a notional amount of 100 billion  in aggregate for additional details refer to note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements

credit facility term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility and revolving credit facility 

in november 2014 we entered into 7500 million  of fiveyear senior unsecured prepayable term loans and a 5000 million  unfunded revolving credit facility collectively the “credit facility” 

in november 2017 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” providing for a 7500 million  fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” which replaced our prior credit facility subject to the terms of the credit agreement the revolving credit facility may be increased in an amount up to 2500 million  in the aggregate we made borrowings of 2500 million  from the revolving credit facility on the closing date which were paid in full during the second half of the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 

we may borrow repay and reborrow funds under the revolving credit facility until its maturity on november 30 2022 the “maturity date” at which time such revolving credit facility will terminate and all outstanding loans under such facility together with all accrued and unpaid interest must be repaid we may prepay the revolving credit facility at any time without a prepayment penalty 

borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at our option at either i the alternative base rate “abr” plus a spread which ranges from 0 bps  to 75 bps  or ii the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a spread which ranges from 100 bps  to 175 bps  the spreads under abr and libor are subject to adjustment in conjunction with credit rating downgrades or upgrades we are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility which ranges from 10 bps  to 25 bps  subject to an adjustment in conjunction with changes to our credit rating as of june 30 2018  we elected to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps  on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility 

the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the credit agreement on a quarterly basis covering the trailing four  consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 350  to 100  in addition we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the credit agreement on a quarterly basis of 300  to 100  covering the trailing four  consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter which can be increased to 400  to 100  for a period of time in connection with a material acquisition or a series of material acquisitions 

we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement as of june 30 2018  the interest expense coverage ratio was 1493 to 100 and the leverage ratio was 132 to 100 considering our current liquidity position shortterm financial forecasts and ability to prepay the revolving credit facility if necessary we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our first quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30 2019

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june 30 2018    



 



 55 

 we have adopted a cashbased longterm incentive “cash lti” program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program cash lti awards issued to employees under the cash longterm incentive plan “cash lti plan” generally vest in three or four equal installments with onethird  or onefourth  of the aggregate amount of the cash lti award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a three or fouryear period in order to receive payments under the cash lti plan participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date 

we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we periodically sell certain letters of credit “lcs” without recourse received from customers in payment for goods and services 

the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lcs for the indicated periods 



factoring and lc fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense income net and were not material for the periods presented 

we maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to 224 million  of which 156 million  had been issued as of june 30 2018  primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for valueadded tax “vat” and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in europe and asia 

we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable nonstandard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hours per week coverage for 12 months see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

working capital 

working capital was 333 billion  as of june 30 2018  which is an increase of 2320 million  compared to our working capital as of june 30 2017  as of june 30 2018  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 288 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity may be affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business spending for business acquisitions including the pending acquisition of orbotech and other factors such as uncertainty in the global and regional economies and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our 7500 million revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs capital expenditures cash dividends stock repurchases and other contractual obligations including repayment of outstanding debt for at least the next 12 months 

 56 

our credit ratings as of june 30 2018  are summarized below   



factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries business acquisitions our financial position and changes in our business strategy 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under our foreign currency risk management strategy we utilize derivative instruments to protect our earnings and cash flows from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates this financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months see note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details our outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts with maximum remaining maturities of approximately ten  months as of june 30 2018  and 2017  were as follows   



in october 2014 we entered into a series of forward contracts “rate lock agreements” to lock the benchmark rate on a portion of the senior notes the rate lock agreements had a notional amount of 100 billion  in aggregate which matured in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 the rate lock agreements were terminated on the date of pricing of the 125 billion  of 4650  senior notes due in 2024 and we recorded the fair value of 75 million  as a gain within accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of december 31 2014 we recognized 08 million  for each of the fiscal years ended june 30 2018  2017  and 2016  for the amortization of the gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss which amount reduced the interest expense as of june 30 2018  the unamortized portion of the fair value of the forward contracts for the rate lock agreements was 48 million  

during the three months ended june 30 2018  we entered into a series of forward contracts the “2018 rate lock agreements” to lock the benchmark interest rate prior to expected debt issuances the objective of the 2018 rate lock agreements was to hedge the risk associated with the variability in interest rates due to the changes in the benchmark rate leading up to the closing of the intended financing on the notional amount being hedged the 2018 rate lock agreement had a notional amount of 5000 million  in aggregate with contract maturity dates in the first half of the fiscal year ending june 30 2019  each forward contract will be closed on the earlier of the completion date of pricing of the portion of the intended debt being hedged or the expiration date we designated each of the 2018 rate lock agreements as a qualifying hedging instrument to be accounted for as a cash flow hedge under which the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss “oci” and subsequently amortized into earnings as a component of interest expenses over the term of the underlying debt the ineffective portion if any will be recognized in earnings immediately the fair market value of the 2018 rate lock agreements outstanding as of the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  was 49 million

indemnification obligations subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us these obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws applicable contracts and delaware and california law the obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters for example we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors officers and employees although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited we believe the fair value of this liability to the extent estimable is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings 

we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters typically these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from or provide customers with other remedies to protect against bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products noncompliance with our product performance specifications infringement by our products of thirdparty intellectual property rights and a breach of warranties representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold validity of certain intellectual property rights noninfringement of thirdparty rights and certain income taxrelated matters in each of these circumstances payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract this usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants to control the defense or settlement of any thirdparty claims brought against the other party further our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts activity typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party and duration in some instances we may have recourse against third parties andor insurance covering certain payments made by us

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of june 30 2018  actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2018  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 150 billion these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of june 30 2018  the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by 136 million 

in november 2014 we issued 250 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior unsecured longterm notes collectively referred to as “senior notes” the fair market value of longterm fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of june 30 2018  the fair value and the book value of our senior notes were 233 billion  and 225 billion  respectively due in various fiscal years ranging from 2020 to 2035 additionally the interest expense for the senior notes is subject to interest rate adjustments following a downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies following a rating change below investment grade the stated interest rate for each series of senior notes may increase between 25 bps to 100 bps based on the adjusted credit rating refer to note 7 “debt” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “liquidity and capital resources”  in part ii item 7 for additional details factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy as of june 30 2018  if our credit rating was downgraded below investment grade by moody’s and sp the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense on the senior notes considering a 200 bps increase to the stated interest rate for each series of our senior notes is estimated to be approximately 450 million 

in november 2017 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” for a 7500 million fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” which replaced our prior credit agreement subject to the terms of the credit agreement the revolving credit facility may be increased in an amount up to 2500 million in the aggregate we made borrowings of 2500 million  from the revolving credit facility on the closing date which were paid in full during the second half of the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  as of june 30 2018  we do not have any outstanding floating rate debts that are subject to an increase in interest rates we are obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility which is subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades the annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility depending upon the then effective credit rating as of june 30 2018  if our credit ratings were downgraded to be below investment grade the maximum potential increase to our annual commitment fee for the revolving credit facility using the highest range of the ranges discussed above is estimated to be approximately 10 million 

see note 4 “marketable securities” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 and risk factors in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of june 30 2018  

as of june 30 2018  we had net forward and option contracts to sell 1309 million  in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures see note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2018  the us dollar equivalent would have been 14 million a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 302 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows 

as of june 30 2018  we had forward contracts to sell 5000 million  in treasury securities in order to hedge certain interest rate exposures see note 14 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details a 10 adverse move in interest rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 241 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that as a result of the hedging of certain of our interest rate exposure changes in most relevant interest rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows

industry 

general background 

klatencor’s core focus is the semiconductor industry the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is typically 150 millimeters 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish other more specialized wafers such as epitaxial silicon “epi” silicononinsulator “soi” gallium nitride “gan” and silicon carbide “sic” are also common in the semiconductor industry 

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper “interconnect” structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when all of the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality the wafer is then cut into individual chips and those chips that passed functional testing are packaged final testing is performed on all packaged chips 

current trends 

the semiconductor equipment industry is currently experiencing growth from multiple drivers such as demand for chips providing computation power and connectivity for artificial intelligence “ai” applications and support for mobile devices at the leading edge of foundry chip manufacturing qualification of early euv lithography processes and equipment is driving growth at leading logicfoundry and dynamic randomaccess memory “dram” manufacturers expansion of the internet of things “iot” together with increasing acceptance of advanced driver assistance systems “adas” in anticipation of the introduction of autonomous cars have begun to accelerate legacynode technology conversions and capacity expansions intertwined in these areas spurred by data storage and connectivity needs is the growth in demand for memory chips finally china is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ics government initiatives are propelling china to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting semiconductor manufacturers from taiwan korea japan and the us china is currently seen as an important longterm growth region for the semiconductor capital equipment sector 

supporting this multisegmented market growth the semiconductor industry continues to introduce numerous technology changes new techniques and architectures in production today include threedimensional finfet transistors threedimensional flash memory “3d nand” design technology cooptimization “dtco” advanced patterning lithography including selfaligned multiple patterning and extreme ultraviolet “euv” lithography and advanced waferlevel packaging klatencor’s inspection and measurement technologies play key roles in enabling our customers to develop and manufacture advanced semiconductor devices to support these trends 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to highvolume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trends such as a specific design rule shrink in today’s market driven by consumer demand for lowcost electronic goods the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies some requiring new substrate and film materials new geometries advanced multiplepatterning and euv lithography and advanced packaging techniques while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected the adoption of these technologies into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects and device performance characteristics namely speed capacity or power management become more sensitive to parameters such as line width and film thickness variation new process materials such as euv lithographycapable photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face 

 2 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 500 billion substantially more than previousgeneration facilities in addition chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment 

by developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and improve their return on investment “roi” once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume our tools help ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution in addition the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules coupled with new materials and device innovation has increased inprocess variability which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling 

klatencor systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer reticle and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems the ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes this helps them increase their yield of highperformance parts and deliver their products to market faster—thus maximizing their profits with our broad portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ nextgeneration products helping our customers respond to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architectures more demanding lithography processes and new backend packaging techniques

customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout asia the united states and europe staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers in each of these regions 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017  2016  and 2015  the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues 

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it has historically been cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy as well as customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are aimed at building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services our customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility which are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier for multiple products and services our revenues are derived primarily from product sales mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in asia the united states and europe we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2017  we employed approximately 2220 fulltime sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of subsidiaries or branches in other countries including belgium china germany israel japan singapore korea and taiwan international revenues accounted for approximately 86  82  and 71  of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended june 30 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 17 “segment reporting and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in nonus dollar product sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in item 1a “risk factors” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our shipment backlog for systems and associated warranty totaled 146 billion and 121 billion as of june 30 2017  and 2016  respectively and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received and the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months orders for service contracts and unreleased products are excluded from shipment backlog all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer often with limited or no penalties we make adjustments for shipment backlog obtained from acquired companies sales order cancellations customer delivery date changes and currency adjustments shipment backlog is not subject to normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our consolidated financial statements in addition the concept of shipment backlog is not defined in the accounting literature making comparisons between periods and with other companies difficult and potentially misleading 

our revenue backlog which includes the gross value of sales orders where physical deliveries have been completed but for which revenue has not been recognized pursuant to our policy for revenue recognition totaled 3280 million and 2550 million as of june 30 2017  and 2016  respectively orders for service contracts are excluded from revenue backlog 

because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods the historical cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between on the one hand our ability to manufacture deliver and install products and on the other the requirements of our customers in our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources management of our operating model and other factors we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries and installations of products which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products 

research and development 

the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs in addition we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby certain government agencies or other third parties fund a portion of our research and development costs as of june 30 2017  we employed approximately 1560 fulltime research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  involved the development of process control and yield management equipment aimed at addressing the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes and new backend packaging techniques for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

 11 

the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product research and development even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to enhance our competitive position new product introductions however may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products and if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in the united states milpitas california singapore israel germany and china as of june 30 2017  we employed approximately 1090 fulltime manufacturing personnel 

some critical parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications while other parts are standard commercial products we use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers through our business interruption planning we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by among other things monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources or disruptions within our suppliers’ oftencomplex supply chains could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors such as applied materials inc asml holding nv hitachi hightechnologies corporation nanometrics inc and rudolph technologies inc some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability interoperability with the existing installed base and technical service and support as well as overall cost of ownership 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

 12 

acquisitions and alliances 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment including without limitation the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial condition results of operations or competitive position 

however any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of june 30 2017  we employed approximately 5990 fulltime employees except for our employees in belgium where a trade union delegation has been recognized and our employees in the german operations of our mie business unit who are represented by employee works council none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees

risk factors 

tableend a description of factors that could materially affect our business financial condition or operating results is provided below 

risks associated with our industry 

ongoing changes in the technology industry as well as the semiconductor industry in particular could expose our business to significant risks 

the semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve pricing trends in the endmarkets for consumer electronics and other products which place a growing emphasis on our customers’ cost of ownership changes in our customers’ capital spending patterns and in general an environment of constant change and development including decreasing product and component dimensions use of new materials and increasingly complex device structures applications and process steps if we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends or with respect to technological advances if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry as the significant majority of our sales are made to semiconductor manufacturers some of the trends that our management monitors in operating our business include the following 

 any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers’ rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce which could result in downward pressure on our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

 16 

we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been and is becoming increasingly highly concentrated due to corporate consolidation acquisitions and business closures in this environment orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales this increasing concentration exposes our business financial condition and operating results to a number of risks including the following 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 17 

the semiconductor equipment industry has been cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict the historically cyclical nature of the primary industry in which we operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization consumer demand for products inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in or cancellation or delay of orders which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customer’s funding status which could be weakened not only by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or companyspecific reasons but also by funding limitations imposed by the customer’s unique corporate structure any of these factors could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results then our business could be seriously harmed furthermore any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

in addition our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics which when made are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time however largely due to the historical cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles our actual results may vary and have varied in the past from forecasted results these variations can occur for any number of reasons including but not limited to unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders product shipments or product acceptances an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to adapt to changing business conditions or a different than anticipated effective tax rate the impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment this is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues but also due to the advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order to meet the expected lead times to significant inventory writeoffs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided we provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of management’s expectations for the future but those reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of and are themselves forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this item 1a and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements if our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts or if we revise our forecasts the market price of our common stock could decline 

 18 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver appears to be slowing which may cause semiconductor manufacturers to delay investments in equipment investigate more complex device architectures use new materials and develop innovative fabrication processes these and other evolving customer plans and needs require us to respond with continued development programs and cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards develop and introduce new products and solutions that successfully address changing customer needs win market acceptance of these new products and solutions and manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner our failure to accurately predict evolving industry standards and develop as well as offer competitive technology solutions in a timely manner with costeffective products could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance features and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

in addition the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks we regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer even before receiving the customer’s formal acceptance of that product in certain situations including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted however our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents all of which must perform to their respective specifications so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall product’s required specifications in such a situation the customer may be entitled to certain remedies which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and as a result our stock price 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of inspection products as a result any delay or reduction of sales of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results the continued customer demand for these products and the development introduction and market acceptance of new products and technologies are critical to our future success 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business in addition we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects the termination of any such collaboration or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration could significantly impair our research and development efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations 

 19 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of continuing significant investments in product research and development however we may enter new markets whether through acquisitions or new internal product development in which competition is based primarily on product pricing not technological superiority further some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing through our business interruption planning we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by among other things monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers certain key parts are available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers also key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers’ proprietary intellectual property in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for highperformance hightechnology components which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products in addition if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations which is a heightened risk during economic downturns it could affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products similarly especially with respect to suppliers of hightechnology components our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in a timely manner and result in delays for our products our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms furthermore a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons including the supplier’s financial condition or business operational decisions which would require us to purchase in a single transaction a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers such “endoflife” parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory writeoff either of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods 

 20 

if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan our operating results business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted 

we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually revised frequently generally quarterly and reviewed by management even more frequently at least monthly our business plan is developed based on a number of factors many of which require estimates and assumptions such as our expectations of the economic environment future business levels our customers’ willingness and ability to place orders leadtimes and future revenue and cash flow our budgeted operating expenses for example are based in part on our future revenue expectations however our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors including the volatile and historically cyclical nature of our primary industry customer order cancellations macroeconomic changes operational matters regarding particular agreements our ability to manage customer deliveries the availability of resources for the installation of our products delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a 

because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results similarly if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period which would also negatively affect our results of operations if we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted such an outcome could cause customers suppliers or investors to view us as less stable or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates any of which could have an adverse impact on our stock price 

in addition our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources the need to manage our operating model and other factors in furtherance of those efforts we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries installations and payment scheduling any such decisions may impact our ability to recognize revenue including the fiscal period during which such revenue may be recognized with respect to such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or stock price 

our capital structure is highly leveraged 

as of june 30 2017  we had 295 billion  aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness consisting of 250 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes and 4463 million  of term loans under a credit agreement the “credit agreement” additionally we have commitments for an unfunded revolving credit facility of 5000 million under the credit agreement we may incur additional indebtedness in the future by accessing the unfunded revolving credit facility under the credit agreement andor entering into new financing arrangements our ability to pay interest and repay the principal of our current indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations our credit rating the ongoing interest rate environment and the other risk factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in addition the interest rates of the senior unsecured longterm notes may be subject to adjustments from time to time if moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” or under certain circumstances a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for moody’s or sp as the case may be a “substitute rating agency” downgrades or subsequently upgrades its rating assigned to the respective series of notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade accordingly changes by moody’s sp or a substitute rating agency to the rating of any series of notes our outlook or credit rating could require us to pay additional interest which may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline factors that can affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position including the incurrence of additional indebtedness and our business strategy 

 21 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of notes by at least two of moody’s sp and fitch inc unless we have exercised our right to redeem the notes of such series we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or at the holder’s option any part of each holder’s notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below the “change of control offer” in the change of control offer we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any on the notes repurchased up to but not including the date of repurchase we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of that series of notes our ability to repurchase that series of notes in such event may be limited by law by the indenture associated with that series of notes or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time if we fail to repurchase that series of notes as required by the terms of such notes it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing that series of notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations 

the term loans under the credit agreement bear interest at a floating rate which is based on the london interbank offered rate plus a fixed spread and therefore any increase in interest rates would require us to pay additional interest which may have an adverse effect on the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline the interest rate under the credit facility is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades additionally under the credit agreement we are required to comply with affirmative and negative covenants which include the maintenance of certain financial ratios the details of which can be found in note 7 “debt” to the consolidated financial statements 

 if we fail to comply with these covenants we will be in default and our borrowings will become immediately due and payable there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time in addition certain of our domestic subsidiaries under the credit agreement are required to guarantee our borrowings under the credit agreement in the event that we default on our borrowings these domestic subsidiaries shall be liable for our borrowings which could disrupt our operations and result in a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

our leveraged capital structure may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and net income per share 

our issuance and maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to 

 our ability to satisfy our future expenses as well as our new debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our future operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our future expenses and service our debt obligations which may impact our ability to manage our capital structure to preserve and maintain our investment grade rating if our future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows we may need to access the unfunded revolving credit facility of 5000 million under the credit agreement or enter into new financing arrangements to obtain necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms any additional borrowing under the credit agreement will place further pressure on us to comply with the financial covenants if we fail to make a payment associated with our debt obligations we could be in default on such debt and such a default could cause us to be in default on our other obligations 

 22 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors first instituted a quarterly dividend during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 since that time we have announced a number of increases in the amount of our quarterly dividend level as well as payment of a special cash dividend that was declared and substantially paid in the second quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30 2015 we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends may be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws changes to our business model and our increased interest and principal payments required by our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions including our indemnification of third parties as well as the performance of our products 

although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties costly and timeconsuming litigation or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes or could impact our revenue or cost recognition any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in our commercial agreements from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers suppliers and lessors with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes in addition notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations whether or not asserted due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects especially when products are first introduced unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us including increased service or warranty costs providing product replacements for or modifications to defective products litigation related to defective products reimbursement for damages caused by our products product recalls or product writeoffs or disposal costs these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business financial condition and operating results in addition our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

 23 

furthermore we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives such as credits toward future purchases we believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our longterm business as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase higher volumes of our products however these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives our volume purchase agreements require significant estimation for the amounts to be accrued depending upon the estimate of volume of future purchases as such we are required to update our estimates of the accruals on a periodic basis until the earnings process is complete our estimates could differ in comparison to actuals as a result these volume purchase arrangements while expected to be beneficial to our business over time could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in nearterm periods including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and therefore our gross margins 

in addition we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customerspecific commitments on pricing tool reliability spare parts stocking levels response time and other commitments furthermore we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection to date we have made no significant accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in supporting an audit or inspection or defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

there are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development 

we are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies both domestically and internationally governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion or a project may be terminated by mutual agreement if the parties determine that the project’s goals or milestones are not being achieved so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future in addition under the terms of these government grants the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur directly and indirectly in connection with such programs any such audit could result in modifications to or even termination of the applicable government funding program for example if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program those costs would not be reimbursed and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded we do not know the outcome of any future audits any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties financial or otherwise termination of funding programs suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency any of which could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our business 

historically we recorded material restructuring charges related to our prior global workforce reductions large excess inventory writeoffs and material impairment charges related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended 2015 we implemented a plan to reduce our global employee workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirements in our industry we substantially completed the global employee workforce reduction during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans or do so within the expected time frame if we again restructure our organization and business processes implement additional cost reduction actions or discontinue certain business operations we may take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to among other things employee terminations or exit costs we may also be required to writeoff additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline also as our lead times from suppliers increase due to the increasing complexity of the parts and components they provide and the lead times demanded by our customers decrease due to the time pressures they face when introducing new products or technology or bringing new facilities into production we may be compelled to increase our commitments and therefore our risk exposure to inventory purchases to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner and that inventory may need to be writtenoff if demand for the underlying product declines for any reason such additional writeoffs could constitute material charges 

 24 

in the past we recorded a material charge related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives based on economic benefit if known or using the straightline method and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for longlived assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and as applicable the amount of any previous impairment charge could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge 

any such additional material charges whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements 

we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements 

we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions any of which may prove not to be financially viable if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables however by entering into these arrangements and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services we are exposed to additional risks if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered 

in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws if we were to violate any such law we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general commercial operational financial and regulatory risks 

we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy 

the markets for semiconductors and therefore our business are ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending which caused our customers to decrease cancel or delay their equipment and service orders from us in the economic slowdown during fiscal year 2009 in addition the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell reduced demand combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of such financing has at times in the past adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels 

 25 

in addition a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and where applicable credit ratings a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity if the market value of such investments were to decline or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges including but not limited to 

 

 any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

 26 

we might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property or other confidential information that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information in addition we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties with respect to intellectual property infringement disputes our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition furthermore we may potentially be subject to claims by customers suppliers or other business partners or by governmental law enforcement agencies related to our receipt distribution andor use of thirdparty intellectual property or confidential information legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit and associated internal investigations with respect to intellectual property or confidential information disputes are often expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert management’s attention and other company resources andor may result in restrictions on our ability to sell our products settlements on significantly adverse terms or adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines any of which could have a significant negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings claims or investigations the instigation of legal proceedings or claims our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims or the determination of any adverse findings against us or any of our employees in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our business reputation 

we are exposed to various risks related to the legal regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to compliance with new existing different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust anticorruptionantibribery unclaimed property and export control regulations our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws rules or regulations or changes to existing laws rules or regulations including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business from time to time we may receive inquiries or audit notices from governmental or regulatory bodies or we may participate in voluntary disclosure programs related to legal regulatory or tax compliance matters and these inquiries notices or programs may result in significant financial cost including investigation expenses defense costs assessments and penalties reputational harm and other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations including those that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental regulations including regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute potentially more expensive andor rarer materials further we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by any release regardless of fault we also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the materials composition of our products including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources of certain metals and other materials the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business 

 27 

in addition we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment immigration contracts product performance product liability antitrust environmental regulations securities unfair competition and other matters in addition to proceedings and claims related to intellectual property matters which are separately discussed elsewhere in this item 1a these legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit our ability to sell our products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims which could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our current and future needs our business and operations could be harmed 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation information systems management and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting and procurement functions to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations in addition many of these outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage employ cloud computing technology for such storage these providers’ cloud computing systems may be susceptible to “cyber incidents” such as intentional cyber attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cybersecurity compromises which are outside of our control if we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as anticipated or do not adequately protect our data from cyberrelated security breaches or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes we may experience operational difficulties such as limitations on our ability to ship products increased costs manufacturing or service interruptions or delays loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data quality and compliance issues and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and cyber incidents 

in the conduct of our business we collect use transmit and store data on information systems this data includes confidential information transactional information and intellectual property belonging to us our customers and our business partners as well as personallyidentifiable information of individuals we allocate significant resources to network security data encryption and other measures to protect our information systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse despite our ongoing efforts to enhance our network security measures our information systems are susceptible to computer viruses cyberrelated security breaches and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions tampering misuse criminal acts including phishing or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate and are subject to the inherent vulnerabilities of network security measures we have experienced cyberrelated attacks in the past and may experience cyberrelated attacks in the future our security measures may also be breached due to employee errors malfeasance or otherwise third parties may also attempt to influence employees users suppliers or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our our customers’ or business partners’ data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to the information systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

any of such occurrences could result in disruptions to our operations misappropriation corruption or theft of confidential information including intellectual property and other critical data of klatencor our customers and other business partners misappropriation of funds and company assets reduced value of our investments in research development and engineering litigation with or payment of damages to third parties reputational damage costs to comply with regulatory inquiries or actions data privacy issues costs to rebuild our internal information systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs 

 28 

we carry insurance that provides some protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident but it will not likely cover all such losses and the losses that it does not cover may be significant 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact our business operations 

our global operations are dependent upon certain information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications system failures or malfunctioning such as difficulties with our customer relationship management “crm” system could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results our enterprise resource planning “erp” system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records record transactions provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems whether in connection with the regular operation periodic enhancements modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than anticipated in addition we may lose key employees of the acquired companies as a result risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons including 

 at times we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary highly sensitive information the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

 29 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations or in the operations of our customers due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states singapore israel germany and china in addition our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors as well as our other operations and those of our customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fire earthquake volcanic eruptions energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites we cannot ensure that alternate means of conducting our operations whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if such alternate means were available they could be obtained on favorable terms 

in addition as part of our costcutting actions we have consolidated several operating facilities our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above such as acts of war or terrorism earthquakes fires or other natural disasters if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at or acts of war in the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business increased international political instability in various parts of the world disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations we maintain significant manufacturing and research and development operations in israel an area that has historically experienced a high degree of political instability and we are therefore exposed to risks associated with future instability in that region such instability could directly impact our ability to operate our business or our customers’ ability to operate their businesses in the affected region cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate such instability could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we selfinsure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain risks are uninsurable are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance accordingly we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds the applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy for example we do not currently hold earthquake insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations a significant portion of which are conducted in california an area highly susceptible to earthquakes it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products much of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we selfinsure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also selfinsured either based on a similar costbenefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

 30 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the japanese yen and the euro we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally in addition an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the united states and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected furthermore if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge we may experience material financial losses 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments impairment of our investments could harm our earnings in addition we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that are susceptible to changes in market interest rates and bond yields as market interest rates and bond yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss we believe we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity however an impairment of the fair market value of our investments even if unrealized must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

in addition the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets our operating results or other performance metrics or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies 

we are exposed to risks in connection with tax and regulatory compliance audits in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits such as related to customs or product safety requirements in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes penalties fines or other prohibitions against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that our products and practices comply with applicable regulations the final determination of any such audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals related to income taxes and other contingencies the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

we earn profits in and are therefore potentially subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions including singapore israel and the cayman islands the countries in which we earn the majority of our nonus profits due to economic political or other conditions tax rates in those jurisdictions may be subject to significant change a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in the tax rates imposed by those jurisdictions expiration of tax holidays in certain jurisdictions that are not renewed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in stockbased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws for example proposals for fundamental united states international tax reform changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes a change in our effective tax rate can materially and adversely impact our results from operations 

 31 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements has become increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices or changes in interpretations of such standards practices or rules can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting standards and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future changes to or revised interpretations or applications of existing accounting standards or tax rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business for example in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an accounting standard update regarding revenue from contracts with customers and in february 2016 the fasb issued an accounting standard update which amends the existing accounting standards for leases adoption of new standards may require changes to our processes accounting systems and internal controls difficulties encountered during adoption could result in internal control deficiencies or delay the reporting of our financial results

tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements which involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured we derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems spare parts and services in general we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer when we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance we recognize revenue upon delivery and customer acceptance under certain circumstances however we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer as follows 

 in circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation 

in many instances products are sold in standalone arrangements services are sold separately through renewals of annual maintenance contracts we have multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period to determine the relative fair value of each element in a revenue arrangement we allocate arrangement consideration based on the selling price hierarchy for substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services we use vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” or thirdparty evidence “tpe” to allocate the selling price to each deliverable we determine tpe based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a standalone basis when we are unable to establish relative selling price using vsoe or tpe we use estimated selling price “esp” in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis esp could potentially be used for new or customized products we regularly review relative selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 

in a multiple element revenue arrangement we defer revenue recognition associated with the relative fair value of each undelivered element until that element is delivered to the customer to be considered a separate element the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting which means that such product or service must fulfill the following criteria a the delivered items has value to the customer on a standalone basis and b if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control if the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer 

 37 

tradein rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases we estimate the value of the tradein right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale this amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the tradein right or the expiration of the tradein right 

we enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers we accrue the estimated credits earned by our customers for such incentives and in situations when the credit levels vary depending upon sales volume we update our accrual based on the amount that we estimate to be purchased pursuant to the volume purchase agreements accruals for customer credits are recorded as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract including consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured 

we sell standalone software that is subject to software revenue recognition guidance we periodically review selling prices to determine whether vsoe exists and in situations where we are unable to establish vsoe for undelivered elements such as postcontract service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for 12  months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences 

the deferred system profit balance equals the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria less applicable product and warranty costs deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to certain customers in japan to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to such customers in japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance 

we enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units additionally judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or market demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

warranty  we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12  months providing labor and parts necessary to repair and maintain the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses utilizing actual service records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge we update these estimated charges on a regular basis the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

 38 

allowance for doubtful accounts  a majority of our accounts receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to record additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

accounting for stockbased compensation plans  we account for stockbased awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards the fair value of stockbased awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period the fair value for restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units the fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date the award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests ie the award holder is entitled to receive credits payable in cash or shares of our common stock equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award additionally we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimated amounts the fair value is determined using a blackscholes valuation model for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan the blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of assumptions including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the marketbased historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock 

accounting for cashbased longterm incentive compensation  cashbased longterm incentive “cash lti” awards issued to employees under our cash lti program vest in three  or four  equal installments with onethird  or onefourth  of the aggregate amount of the cash lti award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a three  or four year period in order to receive payments under a cash lti award participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date compensation expense related to the cash lti awards is recognized over the vesting term which is adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures 

contingencies and litigation  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” and note 14 “litigation and other legal matters” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

goodwill and intangible assets  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable longlived purchased intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable see note 6 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination we performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit in our second quarter of fiscal year ended june 30 2017  and concluded that there was no impairment there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test the next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30 2018  

if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions we may be required to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment analysis in addition if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets we may be required to record goodwill andor intangible asset impairment charges in future periods it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or if it does whether such charge would be material to our results of operations 

 39 

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

valuation of marketable securities our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration of the investment the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment default and loss rates of the underlying collateral structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment

executive summary 

klatencor corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products and related service software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process from research and development to final volume production we provide leadingedge equipment software and support that enable ic manufacturers to identify resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost in addition to serving the semiconductor industry we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries including advanced packaging light emitting diode  “ led ” power devices compound semiconductor and data storage industries as well as general materials research 

our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer ic lithography reticle “reticle” or “mask” and disk manufacturers around the world our products services and expertise are used by our customers to measure detect analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes our revenues are driven largely by our customers’ spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand or expansion plans our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets  memory foundry and logic all three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in enduser demand which influence the level and pattern of our customers’ spending on our products and services although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been cyclical the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics communications data processing and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions particularly in the foundry and logic markets which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market 

as we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability as our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings in the global semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries china is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ics government initiatives are propelling china to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting semiconductor manufacturers from taiwan korea japan and the us china is currently seen as an important longterm growth region for the semiconductor capital equipment sector we are also subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries the timing length intensity and volatility of the capacityoriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable 

the semiconductor industry has also been characterized by constant technological innovation currently there are multiple drivers for growth in the industry with increased demand for chips providing computation power and connectivity for ai applications and support for mobile devices at the leading edge of foundry chip manufacturing qualification of early euv lithography processes and equipment is driving growth at leading logicfoundry and dram manufacturers expansion of the iot together with increasing acceptance of adas in anticipation of the introduction of autonomous cars have begun to accelerate legacynode technology conversions and capacity expansions intertwined in these areas spurred by data storage and connectivity needs is the growth in demand for memory chips on the other hand higher design costs for the most advanced ics could economically constrain leadingedge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications we believe that over the long term our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications that fuel demand for process control equipment although the growth for such equipment may be adversely impacted by higher design costs for advanced ics reuse of installed products and delays in production ramps by our customers in response to higher costs and technical challenges at more advanced technology nodes 

 41 

the demand for our products and our revenue levels are driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate advanced ics that are incorporated into sophisticated mobile devices the timing for our customers in ordering and taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment is also determined by our customers’ requirements to meet the next generation production ramp schedules and the timing for capacity expansion to meet end customer demand our earnings will depend not only on our revenue levels but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers’ technology roadmaps we have maintained production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventoryrelated and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate over the past year our customers have taken delivery of higher volumes of process control equipment than they did in the previous year however any delay or push out by our customers in taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment may cause earnings volatility due to increases in the risk of inventory related charges as well as timing of revenue recognition 

on october 20 2015 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization the “merger agreement” or “merger” with lam research corporation “lam research” which was subject to regulatory approvals on october 5 2016  we mutually agreed to terminate the merger agreement and n o termination fees were payable by either party in connection with the termination 

the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years   



total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 increased by 17 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 our year over year revenue growth reflected increases from sales of both our inspection and metrology products as our customers continue to invest in process control and services increased revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 were also driven by strong demand from our foundry customers and an increase in the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over this time period for our service revenues 

total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 increased by 6 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 our year over year revenue growth reflected increases from sales of both our inspection and metrology products as our customers continue to invest in process control and services increased revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 were also driven by the introduction of our new generation of inspection products as well strong demand from our foundry customers and an increase in the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over this time period for our service revenues 

revenues and gross margin   



product revenues 

our business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles in the preceding period 

 42 

product revenues increased by 20 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  primarily due to growth in revenues from our customers in korea taiwan and europe  israel our year over year increase in our product revenues were primarily driven by strong demand for our inspection and metrology products increased investments by our foundry customers to support their new device architectures and process technologies for capacityrelated expansion and sales of our next generation inspection products 

product revenues increased by 6 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 primarily due to growth in revenues from our customers in china taiwan and japan partially offset by lower revenues from our customers in north america korea rest of asia and europe  israel the year over year increase in our product revenues were primarily driven by strong demand for our inspection and metrology products the introduction of our new generation of inspection products and the expansion of semiconductor investments in asia particularly in china and taiwan from our foundry customers 

service revenues 

service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period the amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems but it is also impacted by other factors such as our rate of service contract renewals the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended june 30 2015  2016  and 2017  primarily as a result of an increase over time in the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over that time period 

revenues  top customers 

the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the indicated periods 

revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows 

a significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that trend to continue 

 43 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions 

the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage 

changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues it also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements this includes the impact of capacity utilization use of overtime and variability of cost structure changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk 

our gross margin increased to 630  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  from 610  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  primarily due to a higher revenue volume of products and services and a favorable mix of products and services sold partially offset by other service and manufacturing costs 

our gross margin increased to 610  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  from 568  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  primarily due to a favorable mix of products and services sold an increase in manufacturing efficiencies driven by lower warranty costs as well as a decrease in severancerelated expenses and higher revenue volume of products and services 

research and development “rd”   



rd expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our focused rd efforts that are aligned with our overall business strategy as technological innovation is essential to our success we may incur significant costs associated with rd projects including compensation for engineering talent engineering material costs and other expenses 

 44 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 254 million as a result of additional engineering headcount higher variable compensation and higher employee benefit costs an increase in consulting expenses of 125 million an increase in engineering materials and supplies expenses of 99 million an increase in mergerrelated expenses of 23 million a lower benefit from external funding of 19 million and higher travelrelated costs of 12 million partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of 73 million and lower severancerelated charges of 15 million 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 primarily due to a decrease in employeerelated expenses including severancerelated expenses of 339 million as a result of the reduced headcount from our global workforce reduction that we initiated during the three months ended june 30 2015 partially offset by an increase in variable compensation of 106 million additionally there was a decrease in engineering materials and supplies expenses of 210 million and an increase in the benefit to rd expense from external funding of 54 million 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our research and development we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes 

selling general and administrative “sga” 



sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  primarily due to an increase in consulting expenses of 71 million an increase in employeerelated expenses of 67 million mainly as a result of higher variable compensation and employee benefit costs an increase in travel costs of 23 million an increase in cost of support for sales evaluations of 13 million and an increase in facilitiesrelated expense of 11 million the increases above were partially offset by a decrease in mergerrelated expenses of 66 million and a lower severancerelated charges of 37 million 

sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 primarily due to a decrease in employeerelated expenses including severancerelated expenses of 280 million as a result of the reduced headcount from our global workforce reduction that we initiated during the three months ended june 30 2015 partially offset by an increase in variable compensation of 164 million a decrease in cost of support for sales evaluation of 86 million a decrease in contributions to support our corporate social responsibility program of 70 million and a decrease in travelrelated expenses of 47 million the decreases above were partially offset by an increase in our mergerrelated expenses of 156 million principally for financial advisory services including the fairness opinion fees employeerelated expenses and legal fees during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  

restructuring charges 

during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended 2015 we announced a plan to reduce our global employee workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirements in its industry the goals of this reduction were to enable continued innovation direct our resources toward its best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate we substantially completed our global workforce reduction during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016

the following table shows the activity primarily related to accrual for severance and benefits for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017  2016  and 2015  



interest expense and other expense income net 



during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 interest expense remained relatively unchanged compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 

the increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 was primarily attributable to the 250 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes collectively referred to as “senior notes” the 7500 million unsecured prepayable term loans and the 5000 million unfunded revolving credit facility which were executed during the three months ended december 31 2014  and which were not outstanding for the entire fiscal year ended june 30 2015 in addition the 7500 million of 2018 senior notes were redeemed during the three months ended december 31 2014  

other expense income net is comprised primarily of realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts impairments associated with equity investments in privatelyheld companies interest related accruals such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations and interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio 

the decrease in other expense income net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  was primarily due to an increase in interest accruals related to uncertain tax positions of 64 million a decrease in net gains from our investments in privatelyheld companies of 36 million partially offset by an increase in interest income of 88 million 

the increase in other expense income net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 was primarily due to reduction of interest and penalty accruals related to uncertain tax positions of 55 million and an increase of 45 million for gain on the sale of equity investments in privatelyheld companies net of impairment charges 

loss on extinguishment of debt and other net 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 loss on extinguishment of debt and other net reflected a pretax net loss of 1317 million  associated with the redemption of our 7500 million of 2018 senior notes during the three months ended december 31 2014  included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other net is the 12 million  gain on the nondesignated forward contract that was entered into by us in anticipation of the redemption of the 2018 senior notes which were redeemed during the three  months ended december 31 2014  refer to “note 7 debt” and “note 16 derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for further details we had no loss on extinguishment of debt and other net in the fiscal years ended june 30 2017  and 2016

provision for income taxes 

the following table provides details of income taxes 



the provision for income taxes differs from the statutory us federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates tax credits and other domestic incentives 

tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  was 211  compared to 179  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  tax expense as a percentage of income increased primarily due to an increase in the percentage of income earned in the us compared to income earned outside the us in jurisdictions with lower tax rates tax expense as a percentage of income increased also because there was a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 due to settlements with taxing authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations 

tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 was 179 compared to 157 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 tax expense as a percentage of income increased primarily due to an increase in the percentage of income earned in the us compared to income earned outside the us in jurisdictions with lower tax rates during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 the loss on extinguishment of debt decreased income earned in the us 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income the amount of our pretax income as business activities fluctuate nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income the domestic manufacturing deduction nontaxable or nondeductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

in the normal course of business we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us we are under income tax examination in israel for the fiscal years ended june 30 2013 through june 30 2015 although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

as of june 30 2017  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 302 billion  which is an increase of 5254 million  from june 30 2016  the increase is primarily attributable to our cash generated from operations partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities of 4932 million payment of dividends of 3440 million  payment of term loans of 1300 million  cash used for a business acquisition of 286 million and payment for stock repurchases of 250 million  as of june 30 2017  216 billion  of our 302 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices we currently intend to indefinitely reinvest 200 billion of the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries if however a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the united states we would be required to accrue and pay us and foreign taxes of approximately 3050 of the funds repatriated the amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated of the 216 billion  the remaining cash of 1564 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries and branches for which earnings are not indefinitely reinvested as we have accrued but not paid us taxes on the earnings of these subsidiaries and branches these funds can be returned to the us without accruing any additional us tax expense 

cash dividends and special cash dividend

stock repurchases 

the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017  and 2016  the stock repurchase program is intended in part to offset shares issued in connection with the purchases under our espp program and the vesting of employee restricted stock units

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june 30 2017    



 



 52 

 we have adopted a cashbased longterm incentive “cash lti” program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program cash lti awards issued to employees under the cash longterm incentive plan “cash lti plan” generally vest in three or four equal installments with onethird  or onefourth  of the aggregate amount of the cash lti award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a three or fouryear period in order to receive payments under the cash lti plan participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date 

we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we periodically sell certain letters of credit “lcs” without recourse received from customers in payment for goods and services 

the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lcs for the indicated periods 



factoring and lc fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense income net and were not material for the periods presented 

we maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to 253 million  of which 221 million  had been issued as of june 30 2017  primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for valueadded tax “vat” and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in europe and asia 

we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecasted timehorizon can vary among different suppliers our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately 4328 million  as of june 30 2017  and are primarily due within the next 12 months actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 

we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months providing labor and parts necessary to repair and maintain the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable nonstandard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hours per week coverage for 12 months see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details

working capital 

working capital was 310 billion  as of june 30 2017  which was an increase of 2333 million  compared to our working capital as of june 30 2016  as of june 30 2017  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 302 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global and regional economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our 5000 million unfunded revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs capital expenditures dividends stock repurchases and other contractual obligations including repayment of outstanding debt for at least the next 12 months 

our credit ratings as of june 30 2017  are summarized below   



factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under our foreign currency risk management strategy we utilize derivative instruments to protect our earnings and cash flows from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates this financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months see note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details our outstanding hedge contracts with maximum remaining maturities of approximately ten  months and seven  months as of june 30 2017  and 2016  respectively were as follows   



 54 

in october 2014 in anticipation of the issuance of the senior notes we entered into a series of forward contracts “rate lock agreements” to lock the benchmark rate on a portion of the senior notes the objective of the rate lock agreements was to hedge the risk associated with the variability in interest rates due to the changes in the benchmark rate leading up to the closing of the intended financing on the notional amount being hedged the rate lock agreements had a notional amount of 100 billion  in aggregate which matured in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 we designated each of the rate lock agreements as a qualifying hedging instrument and accounted for as a cash flow hedge under which the effective portion of the gain or loss on the close out of the rate lock agreements was initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a reduction of total stockholders’ equity and subsequently amortized into earnings as a component of interest expense over the term of the underlying debt the ineffective portion if any was recognized in earnings immediately the rate lock agreements were terminated on the date of pricing of the 125 billion  of 4650  senior notes due in 2024 and we recorded the fair value of 75 million  as a gain within accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of december 31 2014  for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017  2016  and 2015  we recognized 08 million  08 million  and 05 million  respectively for the amortization of the gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss which amount reduced the interest expense as of june 30 2017  the unamortized portion of the fair value of the forward contracts for the rate lock agreements was 55 million  the cash proceeds of 75 million  from the settlement of the rate lock agreements were included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 because the designated hedged item was classified as interest expense in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

in addition in november 2014 we entered into a nondesignated forward contract to lock the treasury rate used to determine the redemption amount of the 2018 senior notes that occurred during the three months ended december 31 2014  the objective of the forward contract was to hedge the risk associated with the variability of the redemption amount due to changes in interest rates through the redemption of the existing 2018 senior notes the forward contract had a notional amount of 7500 million  the forward contract was terminated in december 2014 and the resulting fair value of 12 million  was included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other net line in the consolidated statements of operations partially offsetting the loss on redemption of the debt during the three months ended december 31 2014  the cash proceeds from the forward contract were included in the cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 partially offsetting the cash outflows for the redemption of the 2018 senior notes 

indemnification obligations subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us these obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws applicable contracts and delaware and california law the obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters for example we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors officers and employees although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited we believe the fair value of this liability to the extent estimable is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings 

we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters typically these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from or provide customers with other remedies to protect against bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products noncompliance with our product performance specifications infringement by our products of thirdparty intellectual property rights and a breach of warranties representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold validity of certain intellectual property rights noninfringement of thirdparty rights and certain income taxrelated matters in each of these circumstances payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract this usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants to control the defense or settlement of any thirdparty claims brought against the other party further our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts activity typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party and duration in some instances we may have recourse against third parties andor insurance covering certain payments made by us 

 55 

in addition we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customerspecific commitments on pricing tool reliability spare parts stocking levels service response time and other commitments furthermore we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection to date we have made no significant accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future 

it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of june 30 2017  actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2017  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 210 billion these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of june 30 2017  the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by 219 million 

in november 2014 we issued 250 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior unsecured longterm notes collectively referred to as “senior notes” due in various fiscal years ranging from 2018 to 2035 the fair market value of longterm fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of june 30 2017  the fair value and the book value of our senior notes were 267 billion  and 250 billion  respectively additionally the interest expense for the senior notes is subject to interest rate adjustments following a downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies following a rating change below investment grade the stated interest rate for each series of senior notes may increase between 25 bps to 100 bps based on the adjusted credit rating refer to note 7 “debt” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “liquidity and capital resources”  in part ii item 7 for additional details factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy as of june 30 2017  if our credit rating was downgraded below investment grade by moody’s and sp the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense on the senior notes considering a 200 bps increase to the stated interest rate for each series of our senior notes is estimated to be approximately 467 million 

in november 2014 we entered into 7500 million  aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior unsecured prepayable term loans due in 2019 and a 5000 million  unfunded revolving credit facility the interest rates for the term loans are based on libor plus a fixed spread and this spread is subject to adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades the spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the adjusted credit rating the fair value of the term loans is subject to interest rate risk only to the extent of the fixed spread portion of the interest rates which does not fluctuate with change in interest rates as of june 30 2017  the difference between book value and fair value of our term loans was immaterial we are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the unfunded revolving credit facility which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades the annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility depending upon the then effective credit rating as of june 30 2017  if liborbased interest rates increased by 100 bps the change would increase our annual interest expense annually by approximately 40 million as it relates to our borrowings under the term loans additionally as of june 30 2017  if our credit rating was downgraded to be below investment grade the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense for the term loans and the revolving credit facility using the highest range of the ranges discussed above is estimated to be approximately 27 million

industry 

general background 

klatencor’s core focus is the semiconductor industry the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is typically 150 millimeters 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish other more specialized wafers such as epitaxial silicon “epi” silicononinsulator “soi” gallium nitride “gan” and silicon carbide “sic” are also common in the semiconductor industry 

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper “interconnect” structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when all of the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality the wafer is then cut into individual chips and those chips that passed functional testing are packaged final testing is performed on all packaged chips 

current trends 

the growth of consumer demand for mobile devices including smartphones tablets and wearable devices is currently driving growth in the electronics industry and as a result growth in the semiconductor industry as well contained within each of these latest consumer devices are advanced semiconductors that are helping to enable the features consumers want in device performance such as smaller product form factors lower power requirements bigger and brighter screens and speed at a lower cost alongside this market growth the industry continues to experience a high rate of change in technology with the emergence of new techniques and architectures in production today such as threedimensional  “ 3d ”  transistors advanced patterning lithography and advanced waferlevel packaging klatencor’s inspection and measurement technologies play a key role in enabling our customers’ advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes to support these trends

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to highvolume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trends such as a specific design rule shrink in today’s market driven by consumer demand for lowcost electronic goods the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies some requiring new substrate and film materials new geometries advanced lithography and advanced packaging techniques while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected the adoption of these technologies into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects and device performance characteristics namely speed capacity or power management become more sensitive to parameters such as line width and film thickness variation new process materials such as highk dielectrics soi wafers and immersion lithographycapable photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 5 billion substantially more than previousgeneration facilities in addition chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment 

by developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and improve their return on investment “roi” once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume our tools help ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution in addition the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules coupled with new materials and device innovation has increased inprocess variability which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling 

klatencor systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer reticle and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems the ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes this helps them increase their yield of highperformance parts and deliver their products to market faster—thus maximizing their profits with our broad portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ nextgeneration products helping our customers respond to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes and new backend packaging techniques

customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout asia the united states and europe staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers in each of these regions 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2016  2015  and 2014  the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues 

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy as well as customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are aimed at building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services our customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility which are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier for multiple products and services our revenues are derived primarily from product sales mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in asia the united states and europe we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2016  we employed approximately 2110 fulltime sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of whollyowned subsidiaries or branches in other countries including belgium china germany israel japan singapore south korea and taiwan international revenues accounted for approximately 82  71  and 76  of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended june 30 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 16 “segment reporting and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

 10 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in nonus dollar product sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in item 1a “risk factors” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our shipment backlog for systems and associated warranty totaled 121 billion and 984 million as of june 30 2016  and 2015  respectively and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received and the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months orders for service contracts and unreleased products are excluded from shipment backlog all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer often with limited or no penalties we make adjustments for shipment backlog obtained from acquired companies sales order cancellations customer delivery date changes and currency adjustments shipment backlog is not subject to normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our consolidated financial statements in addition the concept of shipment backlog is not defined in the accounting literature making comparisons between periods and with other companies difficult and potentially misleading 

our revenue backlog which includes the gross value of sales orders where physical deliveries have been completed but for which revenue has not been recognized pursuant to our policy for revenue recognition totaled 255 million and 221 million as of june 30 2016  and 2015  respectively orders for service contracts are excluded from revenue backlog 

because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between on the one hand our ability to manufacture deliver and install products and on the other the requirements of our customers in our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources management of our operating model and other factors we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries and installations of products which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products 

research and development 

the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs in addition we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby certain government agencies or other third parties fund a portion of our research and development costs as of june 30 2016  we employed approximately 1430 fulltime research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  involved the development of process control and yield management equipment aimed at addressing the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes and new backend packaging techniques for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

 11 

the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product research and development even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to enhance our competitive position new product introductions however may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products and if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in the united states milpitas california singapore israel germany and china as of june 30 2016  we employed approximately 970 fulltime manufacturing personnel 

some critical parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications while other parts are standard commercial products we use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers through our business interruption planning we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by among other things monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources or disruptions within our suppliers’ oftencomplex supply chains could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors such as applied materials inc asml holding nv hermes microvision inc hitachi hightechnologies corporation nanometrics inc and rudolph technologies inc some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability interoperability with the existing installed base and technical service and support as well as overall cost of ownership 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

 12 

acquisitions and alliances 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment including without limitation the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial condition results of operations or competitive position 

however any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of june 30 2016  we employed approximately 5580 fulltime employees except for our employees in belgium where a trade union delegation has been recognized and our employees in the german operations of our mie business unit who are represented by employee works council none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees

risk factors 

tableend a description of factors that could materially affect our business financial condition or operating results is provided below 

risks associated with the merger 

there are risks and uncertainties associated with the merger with lam research corporation 

on october 21 2015 klatencor announced it had entered into the merger agreement with lam research consummation of the merger is subject to certain conditions including 1 the expiration or termination of any waiting periods applicable to the consummation of the merger under applicable antitrust and competition laws and 2 the absence of any law or order restraining enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger each of lam research’s and klatencor’s obligation to consummate the merger is also subject to certain additional customary conditions including 1 subject to specific standards the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party and 2 performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the merger agreement there is no assurance that the conditions to the merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all further the pendency of the merger agreement may have an adverse effect on our business and share price additionally if the merger is not completed we may suffer a number of consequences that could adversely affect our business results of operations and stock price there are numerous risks related to the merger including the following 

 in addition we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the merger and these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether the merger is consummated 

several lawsuits have been filed against lam research and us challenging the merger and an adverse ruling may prevent the merger from being completed 

lam research klatencor merger sub 1 and merger sub 2 as well as the members of the klatencor board have been named as defendants in several lawsuits brought by klatencor stockholders additional lawsuits may be filed against lam research klatencor merger sub 1 merger sub 2 and the directors of one of the foregoing companies in connection with the merger 

one of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no order injunction decree or other legal restraint or prohibition shall be in effect that prevents completion of the merger consequently if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in the lawsuits referenced above and the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the defendants’ ability to complete the merger then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the merger from becoming effective within the expected time frame or at all 

 16 

the merger is subject to the receipt of consents and clearances from domestic and foreign regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on lam research klatencor or the combined company or if not obtained could prevent completion of the merger 

before the merger may be completed applicable waiting periods must expire or terminate under antitrust and competition laws and various approvals or consents must be obtained from regulatory entities in addition at any time prior to the merger competition authorities may seek to enjoin completion of the merger in deciding whether to grant antitrust or regulatory clearances the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the merger on competition within their relevant jurisdiction the terms and conditions of any approvals that are granted may impose requirements limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business klatencor and lam research have obtained consents or clearances from regulatory authorities in germany israel ireland and taiwan the merger agreement may require klatencor and lam research to comply with conditions imposed by regulatory entities and in certain circumstances either company may refuse to close the merger on the basis of those regulatory conditions there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions terms obligations or restrictions or that such conditions terms obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger in addition we can provide no assurance that any such conditions obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger 

on may 13 2016 lam research and klatencor each received a request for additional information and documentary material commonly referred to as a “second request” from the united states department of justice doj in connection with the proposed transaction between the companies the companies are working with the staff of the doj on the terms of a consent decree 

for additional information on the risks associated with our proposed merger with lam research please review the risks beginning on page 22 of the joint proxy statementprospectus filed by lam research with the sec on january 13 2016 which risks are incorporated by reference herein and included as exhibit 991 to this annual report 

risks associated with our industry 

ongoing changes in the technology industry as well as the semiconductor industry in particular could expose our business to significant risks 

the semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve pricing trends in the endmarkets for consumer electronics and other products which place a growing emphasis on our customers’ cost of ownership changes in our customers’ capital spending patterns and in general an environment of constant change and development including decreasing product and component dimensions use of new materials and increasingly complex device structures applications and process steps if we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends or with respect to technological advances if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry as the significant majority of our sales are made to semiconductor manufacturers some of the trends that our management monitors in operating our business include the following 



 17 

 any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers’ rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce which could result in downward pressure on our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been and is becoming increasingly highly concentrated due to corporate consolidation acquisitions and business closures in this environment orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales this increasing concentration exposes our business financial condition and operating results to a number of risks including the following 



 18 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict the cyclical nature of the primary industry in which we operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization consumer demand for products inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital this cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in or cancellation or delay of orders which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customer’s funding status which could be weakened not only by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or companyspecific reasons but also by funding limitations imposed by the customer’s unique corporate structure any of these factors could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results then our business could be seriously harmed furthermore any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

 19 

in addition our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics which when made are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time however largely due to the cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles our actual results may vary and have varied in the past from forecasted results these variations can occur for any number of reasons including but not limited to unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders product shipments or product acceptances an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to adapt to changing business conditions or a different than anticipated effective tax rate the impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment this is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues but also due to the advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order in order to meet the expected lead times to significant inventory writeoffs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided we provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of management’s expectations for the future but parties reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of and are themselves forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this item 1a and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements if our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts or if we revise our forecasts the market price of our common stock could decline 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver appears to be slowing which may cause semiconductor manufacturers to delay investments in equipment investigate more complex device architectures use new materials and develop innovative fabrication processes these and other evolving customer plans and needs require us to respond with continued development programs and cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards develop and introduce new products and solutions that successfully address changing customer needs win market acceptance of these new products and solutions and manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner our failure to accurately predict evolving industry standards and develop as well as offer competitive technology solutions in a timely manner with costeffective products could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

in this environment we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance features and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

in addition the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks we regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer even before receiving the customer’s formal acceptance of that product in certain situations including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted however our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents all of which must perform to their respective specifications so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall product’s required specifications in such a situation the customer may be entitled to certain remedies which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and as a result our stock price 

 20 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of inspection products as a result any delay or reduction of sales of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results the continued customer demand for these products and the development introduction and market acceptance of new products and technologies are critical to our future success 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business in addition we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects the termination of any such collaboration or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration could significantly impair our research and development efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of continuing significant investments in product research and development however we may enter new markets whether through acquisitions or new internal product development in which competition is based primarily on product pricing not technological superiority further some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

 21 

our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing through our business interruption planning we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by among other things monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers certain key parts are available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers also key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers’ proprietary intellectual property in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for highperformance hightechnology components which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products in addition if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations which is a heightened risk during economic downturns it could affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products similarly especially with respect to suppliers of hightechnology components our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in a timely manner and result in delays for our products our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms furthermore a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons including the supplier’s financial condition or business operational decisions which would require us to purchase in a single transaction a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers such “endoflife” parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory writeoff either of which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods 

if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan our operating results business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted 

we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually revised frequently generally quarterly and reviewed by management even more frequently at least monthly our business plan is developed based on a number of factors many of which require estimates and assumptions such as our expectations of the economic environment future business levels our customers’ willingness and ability to place orders leadtimes and future revenue and cash flow our budgeted operating expenses for example are based in part on our future revenue expectations however our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors including the volatile and cyclical nature of our primary industry customer order cancellations macroeconomic changes operational matters regarding particular agreements our ability to manage customer deliveries the availability of resources for the installation of our products delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a 

because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results similarly if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period which would also negatively affect our results of operations if we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted such an outcome could cause customers suppliers or investors to view us as less stable or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

in addition our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources the need to manage our operating model and other factors in furtherance of those efforts we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries installations and payment scheduling any such decisions may impact our ability to recognize revenue including the fiscal period during which such revenue may be recognized with respect to such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or stock price 

 22 

our outstanding indebtedness was substantially increased in the second quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30 2015 and as a result our capital structure is more highly leveraged 

as of june 30 2016  we had 308 billion  aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness consisting of 250 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes and 5763 million  of term loans under a credit agreement the “credit agreement” additionally we have commitments for an unfunded revolving credit facility of 5000 million under the credit agreement we may incur additional indebtedness in the future by accessing the unfunded revolving credit facility under the credit agreement andor entering into new financing arrangements our ability to pay interest and repay the principal of our current indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations our credit rating the ongoing interest rate environment and the other risk factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in addition the interest rates of the senior unsecured longterm notes may be subject to adjustments from time to time if moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” or under certain circumstances a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for moody’s or sp as the case may be a “substitute rating agency” downgrades or subsequently upgrades its rating assigned to the respective series of notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade accordingly changes by moody’s sp or a substitute rating agency to the rating of any series of notes our outlook or credit rating could require us to pay additional interest which may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline factors that can affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position including the incurrence of additional indebtedness and our business strategy 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of notes by at least two of moody’s sp and fitch inc unless we have exercised its right to redeem the notes of such series we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or at the holder’s option any part of each holder’s notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below the “change of control offer” in the change of control offer we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any on the notes repurchased up to but not including the date of repurchase we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of that series of notes our ability to repurchase that series of notes in such event may be limited by law by the indenture associated with that series of notes or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time if we fail to repurchase that series of notes as required by the terms of such notes it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing that series of notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations 

the term loans under the credit agreement bear interest at a floating rate which is based on the london interbank offered rate plus a fixed spread and therefore any increase in interest rates would require us to pay additional interest which may have an adverse effect on the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline the interest rate under the credit facility is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades additionally under the credit agreement we are required to comply with affirmative and negative covenants which include the maintenance of certain financial ratios the details of which can be found in note 6 “debt” if we fail to comply with these covenants we will be in default and our borrowings will become immediately due and payable there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time in addition certain of our domestic subsidiaries under the credit agreement are required to guarantee our borrowings under the credit agreement in the event that we default on our borrowings these domestic subsidiaries shall be liable for our borrowings which could disrupt our operations and result in a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

our leveraged capital structure may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and net income per share 

we completed our leveraged recapitalization transaction during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2014 which included raising 325 billion in new borrowings consisting of 250 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes and 7500 million of term loans under the credit agreement payment of a special cash dividend of approximately 276 billion and prepayment of our 750 million of existing senior notes due in 2018 our issuance and maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to 



 23 

 our ability to satisfy our future expenses as well as our new debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our future operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our future expenses and service our new debt obligations which may impact our ability to manage our capital structure to preserve and maintain our investment grade rating if our future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows we may need to access the unfunded revolving credit facility of 500 million under the credit agreement or enter into new financing arrangements to obtain necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms any additional borrowing under the credit agreement will place further pressure on us to comply with the financial covenants if we fail to make a payment associated with our new debt obligations we could be in default on such debt and such a default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors first instituted a quarterly dividend during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 since that time we have announced a number of increases in the amount of our quarterly dividend level as well as payment of a special cash dividend that was declared and substantially paid in the second quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30 2015 we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends may be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws changes to our business model restrictions on increasing dividends under the merger agreement and our increased interest and principal payments required by our 308 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions including our indemnification of third parties as well as the performance of our products 

although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties costly and timeconsuming litigation or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes or could impact our revenue or cost recognition any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in our commercial agreements from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers suppliers and lessors with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes in addition notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations whether or not asserted due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

 24 

we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects especially when products are first introduced unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us including increased service or warranty costs providing product replacements for or modifications to defective products litigation related to defective products reimbursement for damages caused by our products product recalls or product writeoffs or disposal costs these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business financial condition and operating results in addition our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

furthermore we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives such as credits toward future purchases we believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our longterm business as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase higher volumes of our products however these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives as a result these volume purchase arrangements while expected to be beneficial to our business over time could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in nearterm periods including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and therefore our gross margins 

in addition we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customerspecific commitments on pricing tool reliability spare parts stocking levels response time and other commitments furthermore we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection to date we have made no significant accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in supporting an audit or inspection or defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

there are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development 

we are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies both domestically and internationally governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion or a project may be terminated by mutual agreement if the parties determine that the project’s goals or milestones are not being achieved so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future in addition under the terms of these government grants the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur directly and indirectly in connection with such programs any such audit could result in modifications to or even termination of the applicable government funding program for example if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program those costs would not be reimbursed and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded we do not know the outcome of any future audits any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties financial or otherwise termination of funding programs suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency any of which could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

 25 

we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our business 

historically we recorded material restructuring charges related to our prior global workforce reductions large excess inventory writeoffs and material impairment charges related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended 2015 we implemented a plan to reduce our global employee workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirements in our industry we substantially completed the global employee workforce reduction during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 and recorded net restructuring charges of 89 million  during the same period such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans or do so within the expected time frame if we again restructure our organization and business processes implement additional cost reduction actions or discontinue certain business operations we may take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to among other things employee terminations or exit costs we may also be required to writeoff additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline also as our lead times from suppliers increase due to the increasing complexity of the parts and components they provide and the lead times demanded by our customers decrease due to the time pressures they face when introducing new products or technology or bringing new facilities into production we may be compelled to increase our commitments and therefore our risk exposure to inventory purchases to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner and that inventory may need to be writtenoff if demand for the underlying product declines for any reason such additional writeoffs could constitute material charges 

as noted above in the past we recorded a material charge related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives based on economic benefit if known or using the straightline method and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for longlived assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and as applicable the amount of any previous impairment charge could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge 

any such additional material charges whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements 

we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements 

we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions any of which may prove not to be financially viable if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables however by entering into these arrangements and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services we are exposed to additional risks if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 26 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered 

in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws if we were to violate any such law we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general commercial operational financial and regulatory risks 

we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy 

the markets for semiconductors and therefore our business are ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending which caused our customers to decrease cancel or delay their equipment and service orders from us in the economic slowdown during fiscal year 2009 in addition the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell reduced demand combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of such financing has at times in the past adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels 

in addition a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and where applicable credit ratings a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity if the market value of such investments were to decline or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges including but not limited to 

 

 27 

 any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property or other confidential information that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information in addition we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties with respect to intellectual property infringement disputes our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition furthermore we may potentially be subject to claims by customers suppliers or other business partners or by governmental law enforcement agencies related to our receipt distribution andor use of thirdparty intellectual property or confidential information legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit and associated internal investigations with respect to intellectual property or confidential information disputes are often expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert management’s attention and other company resources andor may result in restrictions on our ability to sell our products settlements on significantly adverse terms or adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines any of which could have a significant negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings claims or investigations the instigation of legal proceedings or claims our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims or the determination of any adverse findings against us or any of our employees in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our business reputation 

we are exposed to various risks related to the legal including environmental regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to compliance with new existing different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust anticorruptionantibribery unclaimed property and export control regulations our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws rules or regulations or changes to existing laws rules or regulations including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business from time to time we may receive inquiries or audit notices from governmental or regulatory bodies or we may participate in voluntary disclosure programs related to legal regulatory or tax compliance matters and these inquiries notices or programs may result in significant financial cost including investigation expenses defense costs assessments and penalties reputational harm and other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

 28 

our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations including those that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental regulations including regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute potentially more expensive andor rarer materials further we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by any release regardless of fault we also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the materials composition of our products including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources of certain metals and other materials the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business 

in addition we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment immigration contracts product performance product liability antitrust environmental regulations securities unfair competition and other matters in addition to proceedings and claims related to intellectual property matters which are separately discussed elsewhere in this item 1a these legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit our ability to sell our products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims which could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

regulations related to “conflict minerals” may force us to incur additional expenses may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 

under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the sec adopted requirements for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as “conflict minerals” regardless of their actual country of origin in their products some of these metals are commonly used in electronic equipment and devices including our products these requirements require companies to annually investigate disclose and report whether or not such metals originated from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we have an extremely complex supply chain with numerous suppliers many of whom are not obligated to investigate their own supply chains for the components and parts used in each of our products as a result we may incur significant costs to comply with the diligence and disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant metals used in our products in addition because our supply chain is so complex we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origin of all the relevant metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our business reputation though we do not anticipate that our customers will need to know our conflict mineral status to satisfy their own sec reporting obligations if any we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers if they nonetheless require that we prove or certify that our products are “conflict free” key components and parts that can be shown to be “conflict free” may not be available to us in sufficient quantity or at all or may only be available at significantly higher cost to us if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier any of these outcomes could adversely impact our business financial condition or operating results 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future our business and operations could be harmed 

 29 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation information systems management and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting and procurement functions to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations in addition many of these outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage employ “cloud computing” technology for such storage which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the user’s physical infrastructure but instead is delivered to and consumed by the user as an internetbased service these providers’ cloud computing systems may be susceptible to “cyber incidents” such as intentional cyber attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cybersecurity compromises which are outside of our control if we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as anticipated or do not adequately protect our data from cyberrelated security breaches or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes we may experience operational difficulties such as limitations on our ability to ship products increased costs manufacturing or service interruptions or delays loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data quality and compliance issues and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and cyber incidents 

in the conduct of our business we collect use transmit and store data on information systems this data includes confidential information transactional information and intellectual property belonging to us our customers and our business partners as well as personallyidentifiable information of individuals we allocate significant resources to network security data encryption and other measures to protect our information systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse despite our ongoing efforts to enhance our network security measures our information systems are susceptible to computer viruses cyberrelated security breaches and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions tampering misuse criminal acts including phishing or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate and are subject to the inherent vulnerabilities of network security measures we have experienced cyberrelated attacks in the past and may experience cyberrelated attacks in the future our security measures may also be breached due to employee errors malfeasance or otherwise third parties may also attempt to influence employees users suppliers or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our our customers’ or business partners’ data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to the information systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

any of such occurrences could result in disruptions to our operations misappropriation corruption or theft of confidential information including intellectual property and other critical data of klatencor our customers and other business partners misappropriation of funds and company assets reduced value of our investments in research development and engineering litigation with or payment of damages to third parties reputational damage costs to comply with regulatory inquiries or actions data privacy issues costs to rebuild our internal information systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs 

we carry insurance that provides some protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident but it will not likely cover all such losses and the losses that it does not cover may be significant 

 30 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact our business operations 

our global operations are dependent upon certain information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications system failures or malfunctioning such as difficulties with our customer relationship management “crm” system could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results our enterprise resource planning “erp” system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records record transactions provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems whether in connection with the regular operation periodic enhancements modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than anticipated in addition we may lose key employees of the acquired companies as a result risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons including 

 at times we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary highly sensitive information the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

 31 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations or in the operations of our customers due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states singapore israel germany and china in addition our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors as well as our other operations and those of our customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fire earthquake volcanic eruptions energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites we cannot ensure that alternate means of conducting our operations whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if such alternate means were available they could be obtained on favorable terms 

in addition as part of our costcutting actions we have consolidated several operating facilities our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above such as acts of war or terrorism earthquakes fires or other natural disasters if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at or acts of war in the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business increased international political instability in various parts of the world disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations we maintain significant manufacturing and research and development operations in israel an area that has historically experienced a high degree of political instability and we are therefore exposed to risks associated with future instability in that region such instability could directly impact our ability to operate our business or our customers’ ability to operate their businesses in the affected region cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate such instability could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we selfinsure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain risks are uninsurable are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance accordingly we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds the applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy for example we do not currently hold earthquake insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations a significant portion of which are conducted in california an area highly susceptible to earthquakes it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products much of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we selfinsure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also selfinsured either based on a similar costbenefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

 32 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the japanese yen and the euro we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally in addition an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the united states and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected furthermore if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge we may experience material financial losses 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments impairment of our investments could harm our earnings in addition we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that are susceptible to changes in market interest rates and bond yields as market interest rates and bond yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss we believe we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity however an impairment of the fair market value of our investments even if unrealized must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

in addition the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets our operating results or other performance metrics or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies 

we are exposed to risks in connection with tax and regulatory compliance audits in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits such as related to customs or product safety requirements in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes penalties fines or other prohibitions against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that our products and practices comply with applicable regulations the final determination of any such audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals related to income taxes and other contingencies the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

we earn profits in and are therefore potentially subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions including singapore israel and the cayman islands the countries in which we earn the majority of our nonus profits due to economic political or other conditions tax rates in those jurisdictions may be subject to significant change a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in the tax rates imposed by those jurisdictions the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in stockbased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws for example proposals for fundamental united states international tax reform changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes a change in our effective tax rate can materially and adversely impact our results from operations 

 33 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements is becoming increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices or changes in interpretations of such standards practices or rules can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future changes to or revised interpretations or applications of existing tax or accounting rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business

management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements which involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured we derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems spare parts and services in general we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer when we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance we recognize revenue upon delivery and customer acceptance under certain circumstances however we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer as follows 

 in circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation 

in many instances products are sold in standalone arrangements services are sold separately through renewals of annual maintenance contracts we have multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period to determine the relative fair value of each element in a revenue arrangement we allocate arrangement consideration based on the selling price hierarchy for substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services we use vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” or thirdparty evidence “tpe” to allocate the selling price to each deliverable we determine tpe based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a standalone basis when we are unable to establish relative selling price using vsoe or tpe we use estimated selling price “esp” in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis esp could potentially be used for new or customized products we regularly review relative selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 

in a multiple element revenue arrangement we defer revenue recognition associated with the relative fair value of each undelivered element until that element is delivered to the customer to be considered a separate element the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting which means that such product or service must fulfill the following criteria a the delivered items has value to the customer on a standalone basis and b if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control if the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer 

 39 

tradein rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases we estimate the value of the tradein right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale this amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the tradein right or the expiration of the tradein right 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract including consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured 

we sell standalone software that is subject to software revenue recognition guidance we periodically review selling prices to determine whether vsoe exists and in situations where we are unable to establish vsoe for undelivered elements such as postcontract service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for 12  months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences 

the deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to certain customers in japan to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to such customers in japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance 

we enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units additionally judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or market demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

warranty  we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12  months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses utilizing actual service records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge we update these estimated charges on a regular basis the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

 40 

allowance for doubtful accounts  a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to record additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

accounting for stockbased compensation plans  we account for stockbased awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards the fair value of stockbased awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period the fair value for restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units the fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date the award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests ie the award holder is entitled to receive credits payable in cash or shares of our common stock equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award the fair value is determined using a blackscholes valuation model for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan the blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of assumptions including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the marketbased historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock we have elected not to include the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and therefore recognize the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs 

accounting for cashbased longterm incentive compensation  cashbased longterm incentive “cash lti” awards issued to employees under our cash lti program vest in four  equal installments with 25  of the aggregate amount of the cash lti award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four year period in order to receive payments under a cash lti award participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date compensation expense related to the cash lti awards is recognized over the vesting term which is adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures 

contingencies and litigation  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” and note 13 “litigation and other legal matters” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

goodwill and intangible assets  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable longlived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable see note 5 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination we performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit in our second quarter of fiscal year ended june 30 2016  and concluded that there was no impairment there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test the next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30 2017  

if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions we may be required to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment analysis in addition if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets we may be required to record goodwill andor intangible asset impairment charges in future periods it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or if it does whether such charge would be material to our results of operations 

 41 

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

valuation of marketable securities our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration of the investment the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment default and loss rates of the underlying collateral structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

effects of recent accounting pronouncements 

  recently adopted 

in november 2015 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an accounting standard update for the presentation of deferred income taxes under this new guidance deferred tax assets and liabilities should be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet we early adopted this accounting standard update on a prospective basis at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended 2016 upon adoption approximately 218 million in net current deferred tax assets were reclassified to noncurrent no prior periods were retrospectively adjusted 

 42 

updates not yet effective 

in may 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standard update regarding revenue from customer contracts to transfer goods and services or nonfinancial assets unless the contracts are covered by other standards for example insurance or lease contracts under the new guidance an entity should recognize revenue in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services in addition the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers in august 2015 the fasb issued an amendment to defer the effective date of the update by one year with early adoption on the original effective date permitted with this amendment the updates are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2019 with early adoption permitted beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2018 subsequent to this amendment the fasb has issued additional clarifying implementation guidance the new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standard update for customer’s cloud based fees the guidance changes what a customer must consider in determining whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license if the arrangement contains a software license the customer would account for the fees related to the software license element in accordance with guidance related to internal use software if the arrangement does not contain a software license the customer would account for the arrangement as a service contract the update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2017 early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual period we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements 

in july 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standard update for the subsequent measurement of inventory the amended guidance requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation the requirement would replace the current lower of cost or market evaluation and the accounting guidance is unchanged for inventory measured using lastin firstout “lifo” or the retail inventory method the update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2018 and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements

executive summary 

klatencor corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products and related service software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process from research and development to final volume production we provide leadingedge equipment software and support that enable ic manufacturers to identify resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost in addition to serving the semiconductor industry we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries including the led and data storage industries as well as general materials research 

our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer ic lithography reticle “reticle” or “mask” and disk manufacturers around the world our products services and expertise are used by our customers to measure detect analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes our revenues are driven largely by our customers’ spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets  memory foundry and logic all three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in enduser demand which influence the level and pattern of our customers’ spending on our products and services although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics communications data processing and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions particularly in the foundry and logic markets which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market 

as we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability as our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings we are also subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries the timing length intensity and volatility of the capacityoriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable 

the semiconductor industry has also been characterized by constant technological innovation the growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices in mobile consumer products has caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity on the other hand higher design costs for the most advanced ics could economically constrain leadingedge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications we believe that over the long term our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications that fuel demand for process control equipment although the growth for such equipment may be adversely impacted by higher design costs for advanced ics reuse of installed products and delays in production ramps by our customers in response to higher costs and technical challenges at more advanced technology nodes 

the demand for our products and our revenue levels are driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate advanced ics that are incorporated into sophisticated mobile devices the timing for our customers in ordering and taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment is also determined by our customers’ requirements to meet the next generation production ramp schedules and the timing for capacity expansion to meet end customer demand during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 we experienced strong demand for our products as we released a new generation of inspection products and our foundry customers increased their level of investments in our process control tools our earnings will depend not only on our revenue levels but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers’ technology roadmaps we have maintained production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventoryrelated and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate over the past year our customers have taken delivery of higher volumes of process control equipment than they did in the previous year however any delay or push out by our customers in taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment may cause earnings volatility due to increases in the risk of inventory related charges as well as timing of revenue recognition due to expiration of credits or volume discounts which if not used by a stipulated time frame will expire

proposed merger with lam research 

on october 20 2015 the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization the “merger agreement” with lam research corporation “lam research” under which klatencor will ultimately become a direct or indirect whollyowned subsidiary of lam research  the merger has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies the consummation of the merger is conditioned on the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the merger agreement on february 19 2016 the merger agreement was approved by klatencor’s stockholders and lam research’s stockholders approved the issuance of lam research’s common stock in the merger refer also to note 1 “description of business and summary of significant accounting policies” and item 1a “risk factors” for additional details on the transaction refer to the copy of the merger agreement attached as an exhibit to the form 8k filed with the us securities and exchange commission “sec” on october 21 2015 

the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years   



total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 increased by 6 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 our year over year revenue growth reflected increases from sales of both our inspection and metrology products as our customers continue to invest in process control and services increased revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 were also driven by the introduction of our new generation of inspection products as well strong demand from our foundry customers and an increase in the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over this time period for our service revenues 

total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  decreased by 4 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  revenue decreases from sales of both our inspection and metrology products for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 reflected our customers’ decline in capital spending for process control equipment due to shifts in the timing of the new technology ramps and capacityrelated expansion plans

our business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles in the preceding period 

 45 

product revenues increased by 6 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  primarily due to growth in revenues from our customers in china taiwan and japan partially offset by lower revenues from our customers in north america korea rest of asia and europe  israel the year over year increase in our product revenues were primarily driven by strong demand for our inspection and metrology products the introduction of our new generation of inspection products and the expansion of semiconductor investments in asia particularly in china and taiwan from our foundry customers 

product revenues decreased by 7 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  primarily as a result of lower revenues from our customers in taiwan china and the rest of asia europe and israel partially offset by higher revenues from our customers in north america korea and japan the decline in revenues was impacted by the timing of development and new technology ramps of our customers as well as the lower shipments of our products particularly to our foundry customers in taiwan due to timing of capacityrelated expansion plans 

service revenues 

service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period the amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems but it is also impacted by other factors such as our rate of service contract renewals the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended june 30 2014  2015  and 2016  primarily as a result of an increase over time in the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over that time period

the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the indicated periods 

revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows 

a significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that trend to continue

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions 

the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage 

changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues it also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements this includes the impact of capacity utilization use of overtime and variability of cost structure changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk 

our gross margin increased to 610  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  from 568  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  primarily due to a favorable mix of products and services sold an increase in manufacturing efficiencies driven by lower warranty costs as well as a decrease in severancerelated expenses and higher revenue volume of products and service 

our gross margin decreased to 568  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  from 579  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  primarily due to lower volume of products and services as well as a reduction in manufacturing efficiencies driven by lower manufacturing output and severancerelated expenses a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 refer to note 14 “restructuring charges” for additional details the above decreases were partially offset by a favorable mix of products and services sold and efficiencies derived from other service and manufacturing costs 

research and development “rd”   



rd expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our focused rd efforts that are aligned with our overall business strategy as technological innovation is essential to our success we may incur significant costs associated with rd projects including compensation for engineering talent engineering material costs and other expenses 

 47 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  were lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  primarily due to a decrease in employee related expenses including severancerelated expenses of 339 million as a result of the reduced headcount from our global workforce reduction that we initiated during the three months ended june 30 2015  partially offset by an increase in variable compensation of 106 million additionally there was a decrease in engineering materials and supplies expenses of 210 million and an increase in the benefit to rd expense from external funding of 54 million 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  were lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  primarily due to a decrease in engineering materials and consulting costs of 198 million associated with the completion of major platform developments a decrease in depreciation expense of 21 million and a decrease in travel expenses of 12 million this was partially offset by an increase in employeerelated expenses of 106 million mainly as a result of our severancerelated expenses a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 refer to note 14 “restructuring charges” for additional details in addition the decrease was partially offset by a 63 million reduction in external funding used to offset the cost of rd activities 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our research and development we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes 

selling general and administrative “sga” 



sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  were lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  primarily due to a decrease in employeerelated expenses including severancerelated expenses of 280 million as a result of the reduced headcount from our global workforce reduction that we initiated during the three months ended june 30 2015  partially offset by an increase in variable compensation of 164 million a decrease in cost of support for sales evaluation of 86 million a decrease in contributions to support our corporate social responsibility program of 70 million and a decrease in travelrelated expenses of 47 million the decreases above were partially offset by an increase in our mergerrelated expenses of 156 million pertaining to the pending merger with lam research principally for financial advisory services including the fairness opinion fees employeerelated expenses and legal fees during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  

sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 83 million mainly as a result of severancerelated expenses a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 refer to note 14 “restructuring charges” for additional details an increase in cost of support for sales evaluation of 65 million an increase in certain expenses of 25 million as a result of our onetime leveraged recapitalization expense that was completed in the three months ended december 31 2014 a payment related to a contractual settlement for 20 million an increase due to the impairment charge recorded for certain longlived assets of 17 million and an increase in legal fees of 16 million in addition during the three months ended december 31 2013 sga expenses were favorably impacted by our receipt of 11 million in proceeds from a class action settlement as well as our recovery of 11 million in receivables that had previously been classified as a bad debt expense during the three months ended december 31 2013 both of which resulted in a decrease of our sga expense for the fiscal year ended june 30 2014 the increases described above were partially offset by a decrease in travel related expenses of 43 million and a decrease in marketingrelated expenses of 19 million

restructuring charges 

during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended 2015 we announced a plan to reduce our global employee workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirements in its industry the goals of this reduction were to enable continued innovation direct our resources toward its best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate we substantially completed our global workforce reduction during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  and recorded an 89 million  net restructuring charge of which 36 million  was recorded to costs of revenues 16 million  to research and development expense and 37 million  to selling general and administrative expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  we recorded a 316 million  net restructuring charge of which 80 million  was recorded to costs of revenues 111 million  to research and development expense and 125 million  to selling general and administrative expense refer to note 14 “restructuring charges” for additional details 

the following table shows the activity primarily related to accrual for severance and benefits for the fiscal years ended june 30 2016  and 2015  



the remaining accrual for severance and benefits as of june 30 2016  is expected to be paid out by the end of our quarter ending december 31 2016 

interest expense and other expense income net 



the increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  was primarily attributable to the 250 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes collectively referred to as “senior notes” the 7500 million unsecured prepayable term loans and the 5000 million unfunded revolving credit facility which were executed during the three months ended december 31 2014  and which were not outstanding for the entire fiscal year ended june 30 2015  in addition the 7500 million of 2018 senior notes were redeemed during the three months ended december 31 2014  

the increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014 was primarily attributable to the issuance of 250 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes and entry into the 7500 million unsecured prepayable term loan facility during the three months ended december 31 2014  as compared to 7500 million of 2018 senior notes for the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  

other expense income net is comprised primarily of realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts impairments associated with equity investments in privatelyheld companies interest related accruals such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations and interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio 

the increase in other expense income net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  was primarily due to reduction of interest and penalty accruals related to uncertain tax positions of 55 million and an increase of 45 million for gain on the sale of equity investments in privatelyheld companies net of impairment charges 

 49 

the decrease in other expense income net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  was primarily attributable to a net decline of 47 million in gains from the sale of equity investments in privatelyheld companies a 11 million decrease in interest income from our investment portfolio as a result of our decision to liquidate certain marketable securities and a 11 million increase in net foreign currency losses resulting from the volatility of the foreign currencies against the us dollar which was partially offset by a decrease in an impairment charge of 10 million related to an equity investment in a privatelyheld company that was deemed to be otherthantemporary impairment and an increase of 09 million of realized gains from the investment portfolio liquidation 

loss on extinguishment of debt and other net 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  loss on extinguishment of debt and other net reflected a pretax net loss of 1317 million  associated with the redemption of our 7500 million of 2018 senior notes during the three months ended december 31 2014  included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other net is the 12 million  gain on the nondesignated forward contract that was entered into by us in anticipation of the redemption of the 2018 senior notes which were redeemed during the three  months ended december 31 2014  refer to “note 6 debt” and “note 15 derivative instruments and hedging activities” for further details we had no loss on extinguishment of debt and other net in the fiscal years ended june 30 2016  and 2014  

provision for income taxes 

the following table provides details of income taxes 



the provision for income taxes differs from the statutory us federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates tax credits and other domestic incentives 

tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  was 179  compared to 157  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  tax expense as a percentage of income increased primarily due to an increase in the percentage of income earned in the us compared to income earned outside the us in jurisdictions with lower tax rates during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 the loss on extinguishment of debt decreased income earned in the us 

tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  was 157  compared to 207  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  tax expense as a percentage of income decreased primarily due to an increase in our research and development credits an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction as a percentage of income and a decrease in the percentage of income earned in the us as a result of the loss on extinguishment of debt compared to income earned outside the us in jurisdictions with lower tax rates 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income the amount of our pretax income as business activities fluctuate nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income the domestic manufacturing deduction nontaxable or nondeductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

in the normal course of business we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

liquidity and capital resources 



cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

as of june 30 2016  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 249 billion  which is an increase of 1042 million  from june 30 2015  the increase is primarily attributable to our cash generated from operations and our net proceeds from investing activities partially offset by the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends and a special cash dividend with respect to fully vested restricted stock units with dividend equivalent rights aggregating to 3463 million  payment for stock repurchases of 1817 million  and payment of term loans of 1350 million  as of june 30 2016  173 billion  of our 249 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices we currently intend to indefinitely reinvest 157 billion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices if however a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the united states we would be required to accrue and pay us and foreign taxes of approximately 3050 of the funds repatriated the amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated we have accrued but have not paid us taxes on the remaining cash of 1573 million of the 173 billion  held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices as such these funds can be returned to the us without accruing any additional us tax expense 

cash dividends and special cash dividend

we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we periodically sell certain letters of credit “lcs” without recourse received from customers in payment for goods 

the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lcs for the indicated periods 



factoring and lc fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense income net and were not material for the periods presented 

we maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to 221 million  of which 187 million  had been issued as of june 30 2016  primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for valueadded tax “vat” and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in europe and asia 

we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecasted timehorizon can vary among different suppliers our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately 2929 million  as of june 30 2016  and are primarily due within the next 12 months actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 

we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable nonstandard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hours per week coverage for 12 months see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details

working capital 

working capital was 287 billion  as of june 30 2016  which was a decrease of 372 million  compared to our working capital as of june 30 2015  as of june 30 2016  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 249 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global and regional economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our 500 million unfunded revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs capital expenditures dividends stock repurchases and other contractual obligations including repayment of outstanding debt for at least the next 12 months 

our credit ratings and outlooks as of june 30 2016  are summarized below   



factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under our foreign currency risk management strategy we utilize derivative instruments to protect our earnings and cash flows from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates this financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months see note 15 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details our outstanding hedge contracts with maximum remaining maturities of approximately seven  months and 16 months as of june 30 2016 and 2015 respectively were as follows

in october 2014 in anticipation of the issuance of the senior notes we entered into a series of forward contracts “rate lock agreements” to lock the benchmark rate on a portion of the senior notes the objective of the rate lock agreements was to hedge the risk associated with the variability in interest rates due to the changes in the benchmark rate leading up to the closing of the intended financing on the notional amount being hedged the rate lock agreements had a notional amount of 100 billion  in aggregate which matured in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  we designated each of the rate lock agreements as a qualifying hedging instrument and accounted for as a cash flow hedge under which the effective portion of the gain or loss on the close out of the rate lock agreements was initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a reduction of total stockholders’ equity and subsequently amortized into earnings as a component of interest expense over the term of the underlying debt the ineffective portion if any was recognized in earnings immediately the rate lock agreements were terminated on the date of pricing of the 125 billion  of 4650  senior notes due in 2024 and we recorded the fair value of 75 million  as a gain within accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of december 31 2014  for the fiscal years ended june 30 2016  and 2015 we recognized 08 million  and 05 million  respectively for the amortization of the gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss which amount reduced the interest expense as of june 30 2016 the unamortized portion of the fair value of the forward contracts for the rate lock agreements was 63 million  the cash proceeds of 75 million  from the settlement of the rate lock agreements were included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  because the designated hedged item was classified as interest expense in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

in addition in november 2014 we entered into a nondesignated forward contract to lock the treasury rate used to determine the redemption amount of the 2018 senior notes that occurred during the three months ended december 31 2014  the objective of the forward contract was to hedge the risk associated with the variability of the redemption amount due to changes in interest rates through the redemption of the existing 2018 senior notes the forward contract had a notional amount of 7500 million  the forward contract was terminated in december 2014 and the resulting fair value of 12 million  was included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other net line in the consolidated statements of operations partially offsetting the loss on redemption of the debt during the three months ended december 31 2014  the cash proceeds from the forward contract were included in the cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  partially offsetting the cash outflows for the redemption of the 2018 senior notes 

indemnification obligations subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us these obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws applicable contracts and delaware and california law the obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters for example we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors officers and employees although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited we believe the fair value of this liability to the extent estimable is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings 

we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters typically these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from or provide customers with other remedies to protect against bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products noncompliance with our product performance specifications infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights used in our products and a breach of warranties representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold validity of certain intellectual property rights noninfringement of thirdparty rights and certain income taxrelated matters in each of these circumstances payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract this usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants to control the defense or settlement of any thirdparty claims brought against the other party further our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts activity typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party and duration in some instances we may have recourse against third parties andor insurance covering certain payments made by us 

 59 

in addition we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customerspecific commitments on pricing tool reliability spare parts stocking levels service response time and other commitments furthermore we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection to date we have made no accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future 

it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of june 30 2016  actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2016  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 148 billion these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of june 30 2016  the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by 165 million 

in november 2014 we issued 250 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior unsecured longterm notes collectively referred to as “senior notes” due in various fiscal years ranging from 2018 to 2035 the fair market value of longterm fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of june 30 2016  the fair value and the book value of our senior notes were 268 billion  and 250 billion  respectively additionally the interest expense for the senior notes is subject to interest rate adjustments following a downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies following a rating change below investment grade the stated interest rate for each series of senior notes may increase between 25 bps to 100 bps based on the adjusted credit rating refer to note 6 “debt” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “liquidity and capital resources”  in part ii item 7 for additional details factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy as of june 30 2016  if our credit rating was downgraded below investment grade by moody’s and sp the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense on the senior notes considering a 200 bps increase to the stated interest rate for each series of our senior notes is estimated to be approximately 534 million 

in november 2014 we entered into 750 million  aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior unsecured prepayable term loans due in 2019 and a 500 million  unfunded revolving credit facility the interest rates for the term loans are based on libor plus a fixed spread and this spread is subject to adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades the spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the adjusted credit rating the fair value of the term loans is subject to interest rate risk only to the extent of the fixed spread portion of the interest rates which does not fluctuate with change in interest rates as of june 30 2016  the difference between book value and fair value of our term loans was immaterial we are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the unfunded revolving credit facility which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades the annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility depending upon the then effective credit rating as of june 30 2016  if liborbased interest rates increased by 100 bps the change would increase our annual interest expense annually by approximately 52 million as it relates to our borrowings under the term loans additionally as of june 30 2016  if our credit rating was downgraded to be below investment grade the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense for the term loans and the revolving credit facility using the highest range of the ranges discussed above is estimated to be approximately 34 million 

see note 4 “marketable securities” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 and risk factors in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of june 30 2016  

as of june 30 2016  we had net forward and option contracts to sell 770 million  in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures see note 15 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2016  the us dollar equivalent would have been 876 million a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 211 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

industry 

general background 

klatencor’s core focus is the semiconductor industry the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is typically 150 millimeters 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish other more specialized wafers such as epitaxial silicon “epi” silicononinsulator “soi” gallium nitride “gan” and silicon carbide “sic” are also common in the semiconductor industry 

 1 

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper “interconnect” structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when all of the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality the wafer is then cut into individual chips and those chips that passed functional testing are packaged final testing is performed on all packaged chips 

current trends 

the growth of consumer demand for mobile devices including smartphones tablets and wearable devices is currently driving growth in the electronics industry and as a result growth in the semiconductor industry as well contained within each of these latest consumer devices are advanced semiconductors that are helping to enable the features consumers want in device performance such as smaller product form factors lower power requirements bigger and brighter screens and speed at a lower cost alongside this market growth the industry continues to experience a high rate of change in technology with the emergence of new techniques and architectures in production today such as threedimensional  “ 3d ”  transistors advanced patterning lithography advanced waferlevel packaging and semiconductors with critical dimensions at 28 nanometer and below klatencor’s inspection and measurement technologies play a key role in enabling our customers’ advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes to support these trends 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to highvolume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trends such as a specific design rule shrink in today’s market driven by consumer demand for lowcost electronic goods the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies some requiring new substrate and film materials new geometries advanced lithography and advanced packaging techniques 

while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected the adoption of these technologies into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects and device performance characteristics namely speed capacity or power management become more sensitive to parameters such as line width and film thickness variation new process materials such as highk dielectrics soi wafers and immersion lithographycapable photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 5 billion substantially more than previousgeneration facilities in addition chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment 

by developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment “roi” once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume our tools help ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution in addition the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules coupled with new materials and device innovation has increased inprocess variability which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling 

 2 

klatencor systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer reticle and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems the ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes this helps them increase their yield of highperformance parts and deliver their products to market faster—thus maximizing their profits with our broad portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ nextgeneration products helping our customers respond to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes and new backend packaging techniques

customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout asia the united states and europe staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers in each of these regions 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2015  2014  and 2013  the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues 

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy as well as customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are aimed at building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services our customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility which are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier for multiple products and services our revenues are derived primarily from product sales mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in asia the united states and europe we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2015  we employed approximately 2390 fulltime sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of whollyowned subsidiaries or branches in other countries including belgium china germany israel japan singapore south korea and taiwan international revenues accounted for approximately 71  76  and 70  of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended june 30 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 17 “segment reporting and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

 10 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in nonus dollar product sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in item 1a “risk factors” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our shipment backlog for systems and associated warranty totaled 984 million and 977 million as of june 30 2015  and 2014  respectively and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received and the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months orders for service contracts and unreleased products are excluded from shipment backlog all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer often with limited or no penalties we make adjustments for shipment backlog obtained from acquired companies sales order cancellations customer delivery date changes and currency adjustments shipment backlog is not subject to normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our consolidated financial statements in addition the concept of shipment backlog is not defined in the accounting literature making comparisons between periods and with other companies difficult and potentially misleading 

our revenue backlog which includes the gross value of sales orders where physical deliveries have been completed but for which revenue has not been recognized pursuant to our policy for revenue recognition totaled 221 million and 269 million as of june 30 2015  and 2014  respectively orders for service contracts are excluded from revenue backlog 

because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between on the one hand our ability to manufacture deliver and install products and on the other the requirements of our customers in our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources management of our operating model and other factors we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries and installations of products which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products 

research and development 

the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs in addition we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby certain government agencies or other third parties fund a portion of our research and development costs as of june 30 2015  we employed approximately 1480 fulltime research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  involved the development of process control and yield management equipment aimed at addressing the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes and new backend packaging techniques for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

 11 

the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product research and development even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to enhance our competitive position new product introductions however may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products and if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in the united states milpitas california singapore israel germany and china as of june 30 2015  we employed approximately 970 fulltime manufacturing personnel 

some critical parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications while other parts are standard commercial products we use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers through our business interruption planning we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by among other things monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources or disruptions within our suppliers’ oftencomplex supply chains could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors such as applied materials inc asml holding nv hermes microvision inc hitachi hightechnologies corporation and nanometrics inc some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability interoperability with the existing installed base and technical service and support as well as overall cost of ownership 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

 12 

acquisitions and alliances 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment including without limitation the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial condition results of operations or competitive position 

however any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of june 30 2015  we employed approximately 5880 fulltime employees except for our employees in belgium where a trade union delegation has been recognized and our employees in the german operations of our mie business unit who are represented by employee works council none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees 

as discussed in our note 15 “restructuring charges” we announced in april 2015 a plan to reduce our global workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirements in our industry the goals of this reduction are to enable continued innovation direct our resources toward our best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate refer to the above footnote for additional details

risk factors 

tableend a description of factors that could materially affect our business financial condition or operating results is provided below 

risks associated with our industry 

ongoing changes in the technology industry as well as the semiconductor industry in particular could expose our business to significant risks 

the semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve pricing trends in the endmarkets for consumer electronics and other products which place a growing emphasis on our customers’ cost of ownership changes in our customers’ capital spending patterns and in general an environment of constant change and development including decreasing product and component dimensions use of new materials and increasingly complex device structures applications and process steps if we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends or with respect to technological advances if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry as the significant majority of our sales are made to semiconductor manufacturers some of the trends that our management monitors in operating our business include the following 

 any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers’ rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce which could result in downward pressure on our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

 16 

we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been and is becoming increasingly highly concentrated due to corporate consolidation acquisitions and business closures in this environment orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales this increasing concentration exposes our business financial condition and operating results to a number of risks including the following 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 17 

the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict the cyclical nature of the primary industry in which we operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization consumer demand for products inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital this cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in or cancellation or delay of orders which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customer’s funding status which could be weakened not only by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or companyspecific reasons but also by funding limitations imposed by the customer’s unique corporate structure any of these factors could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results then our business could be seriously harmed furthermore any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

in addition our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics which when made are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time however largely due to the cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles our actual results may vary and have varied in the past from forecasted results these variations can occur for any number of reasons including but not limited to unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders product shipments or product acceptances an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to adapt to changing business conditions or a different than anticipated effective tax rate the impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment this is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues but also due to the advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order in order to meet the expected lead times to significant inventory writeoffs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided we provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of management’s expectations for the future but parties reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of and are themselves forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this item 1a and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements if our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts or if we revise our forecasts the market price of our common stock could decline 

 18 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions for over 25 years the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips that driver appears to be slowing which may cause semiconductor manufacturers to delay investments in equipment investigate more complex device architectures use new materials and develop innovative fabrication processes these and other evolving customer plans and needs require us to respond with continued development programs and cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards develop and introduce new products and solutions that successfully address changing customer needs win market acceptance of these new products and solutions and manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner our failure to accurately predict evolving industry standards and develop as well as offer competitive technology solutions in a timely manner with costeffective products could result in loss of market share unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence which would adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

in this environment we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance features and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

in addition the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks we regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer even before receiving the customer’s formal acceptance of that product in certain situations including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted however our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents all of which must perform to their respective specifications so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall product’s required specifications in such a situation the customer may be entitled to certain remedies which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and as a result our stock price 

we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of defect inspection products as a result any delay or reduction of sales of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results the continued customer demand for these products and the development introduction and market acceptance of new products and technologies are critical to our future success 

 19 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business in addition we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects the termination of any such collaboration or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration could significantly impair our research and development efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of continuing significant investments in product research and development however we may enter new markets whether through acquisitions or new internal product development in which competition is based primarily on product pricing not technological superiority further some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition

our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing through our business interruption planning we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by among other things monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers also key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers’ proprietary intellectual property in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for highperformance hightechnology components which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products in addition if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations which is a heightened risk during economic downturns it could affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products similarly especially with respect to suppliers of hightechnology components our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in a timely manner and result in delays for our products our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms furthermore a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons including the supplier’s financial condition or business operational decisions which would require us to purchase in a single transaction a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers such “endoflife” parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory writeoff either of which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods 

if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan our operating results business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted 

we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually revised frequently generally quarterly and reviewed by management even more frequently at least monthly our business plan is developed based on a number of factors many of which require estimates and assumptions such as our expectations of the economic environment future business levels our customers’ willingness and ability to place orders leadtimes and future revenue and cash flow our budgeted operating expenses for example are based in part on our future revenue expectations however our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors including the volatile and cyclical nature of our primary industry customer order cancellations macroeconomic changes operational matters regarding particular agreements our ability to manage customer deliveries the availability of resources for the installation of our products delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a 

because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results similarly if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period which would also negatively affect our results of operations if we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted such an outcome could cause customers suppliers or investors to view us as less stable or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

in addition our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources the need to manage our operating model and other factors in furtherance of those efforts we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries installations and payment scheduling any such decisions may impact our ability to recognize revenue including the fiscal period during which such revenue may be recognized with respect to such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or stock price

our outstanding indebtedness was substantially increased in the second quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30 2015 and as a result our capital structure is more highly leveraged 

as of june 30 2015  we had approximately 321 billion  aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness consisting of 250 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes and approximately 7113 million  of term loans under a credit agreement the “credit agreement” additionally we have commitments for an unfunded revolving credit facility of 5000 million under the credit agreement we may incur additional indebtedness in the future by accessing the unfunded revolving credit facility under the credit agreement andor entering into new financing arrangements our ability to pay interest and repay the principal of our current indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations our credit rating the ongoing interest rate environment and the other risk factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in addition the interest rates of the senior unsecured longterm notes may be subject to adjustments from time to time if moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” or under certain circumstances a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for moody’s or sp as the case may be a “substitute rating agency” downgrades or subsequently upgrades its rating assigned to the respective series of notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade accordingly changes by moody’s sp or a substitute rating agency to the rating of any series of notes our outlook or credit rating could require us to pay additional interest which may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline factors that can affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position including the incurrence of additional indebtedness and our business strategy 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of notes by at least two of moody’s sp and fitch inc unless we have exercised its right to redeem the notes of such series we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or at the holder’s option any part of each holder’s notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below the “change of control offer” in the change of control offer we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any on the notes repurchased up to but not including the date of repurchase we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of that series of notes our ability to repurchase that series of notes in such event may be limited by law by the indenture associated with that series of notes or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time if we fail to repurchase that series of notes as required by the terms of such notes it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing that series of notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations 

the term loans under the credit agreement bear interest at a floating rate which is based on the london interbank offered rate plus a fixed spread and therefore any increase in interest rates would require us to pay additional interest which may have an adverse effect on the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline the interest rate under the credit facility is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades additionally under the credit agreement we are required to comply with affirmative and negative covenants which include the maintenance of certain financial ratios the details of which can be found in note 7 “debt” if we fail to comply with these covenants we will be in default and our borrowings will become immediately due and payable there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time in addition certain of our domestic subsidiaries under the credit agreement are required to guarantee our borrowings under the credit agreement in the event that we default on our borrowings these domestic subsidiaries shall be liable for our borrowings which could disrupt our operations and result in a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

 22 

our leveraged capital structure may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and earnings per share 

we completed our leveraged recapitalization transaction during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2014 which included raising approximately 325 billion in new borrowings consisting of 250 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes and approximately 7500 million of term loans under the credit agreement payment of a special cash dividend of approximately 276 billion and prepayment of our 750 million of existing senior notes due in 2018 our issuance and maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including but not limited to 

 our ability to satisfy our future expenses as well as our new debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors furthermore our future operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our future expenses and service our new debt obligations which may impact our ability to manage our capital structure to preserve and maintain our investment grade rating if our future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows we may need to access the unfunded revolving credit facility of 500 million under the credit agreement or enter into new financing arrangements to obtain necessary funds if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason we may not be able to obtain such funding or if funding is available we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms any additional borrowing under the credit agreement will place further pressure on us to comply with the financial covenants if we fail to make a payment associated with our new debt obligations we could be in default on such debt and such a default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors first instituted a quarterly dividend during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 since that time we have announced a number of increases in the amount of our quarterly dividend level as well as payment of a special cash dividend that was declared and substantially paid in the second quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30 2015 we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends may be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws changes to our business model and our increased interest and principal payments required by our approximately 321 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions including our indemnification of third parties as well as the performance of our products 

although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties costly and timeconsuming litigation or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes or could impact our revenue or cost recognition any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 23 

in addition in our commercial agreements from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers suppliers and lessors with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes in addition notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations whether or not asserted due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects especially when products are first introduced unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us including increased service or warranty costs providing product replacements for or modifications to defective products litigation related to defective products reimbursement for damages caused by our products product recalls or product writeoffs or disposal costs these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business financial condition and operating results in addition our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

furthermore we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives such as credits toward future purchases we believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our longterm business as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase higher volumes of our products however these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives as a result these volume purchase arrangements while expected to be beneficial to our business over time could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in nearterm periods including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and therefore our gross margins 

in addition we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customerspecific commitments on pricing tool reliability spare parts stocking levels response time and other commitments furthermore we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection to date we have made no significant accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in supporting an audit or inspection or defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

 24 

there are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development 

we are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies both domestically and internationally governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion or a project may be terminated by mutual agreement if the parties determine that the project’s goals or milestones are not being achieved so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future in addition under the terms of these government grants the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur directly and indirectly in connection with such programs any such audit could result in modifications to or even termination of the applicable government funding program for example if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program those costs would not be reimbursed and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded we do not know the outcome of any future audits any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties financial or otherwise termination of funding programs suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency any of which could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our business 

historically we recorded material restructuring charges related to our prior global workforce reduction large excess inventory writeoffs and material impairment charges related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 we recorded net restructuring charges of 316 million  of which 224 million  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended june 30 2015 primarily related to our plan to reduce our global employee workforce in order to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirements in our industry such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans or do so within the expected time frame if we again restructure our organization and business processes implement additional cost reduction actions or discontinue certain business operations we may take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to among other things employee terminations or exit costs we may also be required to writeoff additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline also as our lead times from suppliers increase due to the increasing complexity of the parts and components they provide and the lead times demanded by our customers decrease due to the time pressures they face when introducing new products or technology or bringing new facilities into production we may be compelled to increase our commitments and therefore our risk exposure to inventory purchases to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner and that inventory may need to be writtenoff if demand for the underlying product declines for any reason such additional writeoffs could constitute material charges 

as noted above in the past we recorded a material charge related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using the straightline method and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for longlived assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and as applicable the amount of any previous impairment charge could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge 

any such additional material charges whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements 

 25 

we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements 

we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions any of which may prove not to be financially viable if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables however by entering into these arrangements and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services we are exposed to additional risks if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered 

in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws if we were to violate any such law we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general commercial operational financial and regulatory risks 

we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy 

the markets for semiconductors and therefore our business are ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending which caused our customers to decrease cancel or delay their equipment and service orders from us in the economic slowdown during fiscal year 2009 in addition the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell reduced demand combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of such financing has at times in the past adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels 

in addition a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and where applicable credit ratings a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity if the market value of such investments were to decline or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

 26 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges including but not limited to 

 any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property or other confidential information that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information in addition we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties with respect to intellectual property infringement disputes our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition furthermore we may potentially be subject to claims by customers suppliers or other business partners or by governmental law enforcement agencies related to our receipt distribution andor use of thirdparty intellectual property or confidential information legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit and associated internal investigations with respect to intellectual property or confidential information disputes are often expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert management’s attention and other company resources andor may result in restrictions on our ability to sell our products settlements on significantly adverse terms or adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines any of which could have a significant negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings claims or investigations the instigation of legal proceedings or claims our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims or the determination of any adverse findings against us or any of our employees in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our business reputation 

 27 

we are exposed to various risks related to the legal including environmental regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to compliance with new existing different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust anticorruptionantibribery unclaimed property and export control regulations our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws rules or regulations or changes to existing laws rules or regulations including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business from time to time we may receive inquiries or audit notices from governmental or regulatory bodies or we may participate in voluntary disclosure programs related to legal regulatory or tax compliance matters and these inquiries notices or programs may result in significant financial cost including investigation expenses defense costs assessments and penalties reputational harm and other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations including those that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental regulations including regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute potentially more expensive andor rarer materials further we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by any release regardless of fault we also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the materials composition of our products including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources of certain metals and other materials the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business 

in addition we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment immigration contracts product performance product liability antitrust environmental regulations securities unfair competition and other matters in addition to proceedings and claims related to intellectual property matters which are separately discussed elsewhere in this item 1a these legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit our ability to sell our products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims which could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

recent regulations related to “conflict minerals” may force us to incur additional expenses may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 

under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the sec adopted requirements for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as “conflict minerals” regardless of their actual country of origin in their products some of these metals are commonly used in electronic equipment and devices including our products these requirements require companies to annually investigate disclose and report whether or not such metals originated from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we have an extremely complex supply chain with numerous suppliers many of whom are not obligated to investigate their own supply chains for the components and parts used in each of our products as a result we may incur significant costs to comply with the diligence and disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant metals used in our products in addition because our supply chain is so complex we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origin of all the relevant metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our business reputation though we do not anticipate that our customers will need to know our conflict mineral status to satisfy their own sec reporting obligations if any we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers if they nonetheless require that we prove or certify that our products are “conflict free” key components and parts that can be shown to be “conflict free” may not be available to us in sufficient quantity or at all or may only be available at significantly higher cost to us if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier any of these outcomes could adversely impact our business financial condition or operating results 

 28 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future our business and operations could be harmed 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation information systems management and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting and procurement functions to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations in addition many of these outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage employ “cloud computing” technology for such storage which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the user’s physical infrastructure but instead is delivered to and consumed by the user as an internetbased service these providers’ cloud computing systems may be susceptible to “cyber incidents” such as intentional cyber attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cybersecurity compromises that are outside of our control if we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as anticipated or do not adequately protect our data from cyberrelated security breaches or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes we may experience operational difficulties such as limitations on our ability to ship products increased costs manufacturing or service interruptions or delays loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data quality and compliance issues and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and cyber incidents 

in the conduct of our business we collect use transmit and store data on information systems this data includes confidential information and intellectual property belonging to us our customers and our business partners as well as personallyidentifiable information of individuals we allocate significant resources to network security data encryption and other measures to protect our information systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse despite our ongoing efforts to enhance our network security measures our information systems are susceptible to computer viruses cyberrelated security breaches and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions tampering or misuse and subject to the inherent vulnerabilities of network security measures any of these occurrences could result in disruptions to our operations misappropriation corruption or theft of confidential information including intellectual property and other critical data of klatencor our customers and other business partners reduced value of our investments in research development and engineering litigation with or payment of damages to third parties reputational damage costs to comply with regulatory inquiries or actions data privacy issues costs to rebuild our internal information systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact our business operations 

our global operations are dependent upon certain information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications system failures or malfunctioning such as difficulties with our customer relationship management “crm” system could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results our enterprise resource planning “erp” system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records record transactions provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems whether in connection with the regular operation periodic enhancements modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 29 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than anticipated in addition we may lose key employees of the acquired companies as a result risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons including 

 at times we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary highly sensitive information the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations or in the operations of our customers due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states singapore israel germany and china in addition our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors as well as our other operations and those of our customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fire earthquake volcanic eruptions energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites we cannot ensure that alternate means of conducting our operations whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if such alternate means were available they could be obtained on favorable terms 

in addition as part of our costcutting actions we have consolidated several operating facilities our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above such as acts of war or terrorism earthquakes fires or other natural disasters if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at or acts of war in the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business increased international political instability in various parts of the world disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations we maintain significant manufacturing and research and development operations in israel an area that has historically experienced a high degree of political instability and we are therefore exposed to risks associated with future instability in that region such instability could directly impact our ability to operate our business or our customers’ ability to operate their businesses in the affected region cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate such instability could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we selfinsure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain risks are uninsurable are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance accordingly we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds the applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy for example we do not currently hold earthquake insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations a significant portion of which are conducted in california an area highly susceptible to earthquakes it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products much of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we selfinsure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also selfinsured either based on a similar costbenefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the euro and the japanese yen we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally in addition an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the united states and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected furthermore if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge we may experience material financial losses 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments impairment of our investments could harm our earnings in addition we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that are susceptible to changes in market interest rates and bond yields as market interest rates and bond yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss we believe we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity however an impairment of the fair market value of our investments even if unrealized must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

 31 

in addition the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets our operating results or other performance metrics or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies 

we are exposed to risks in connection with tax and regulatory compliance audits in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits such as related to customs or product safety requirements in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes penalties fines or other prohibitions against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that our products and practices comply with applicable regulations the final determination of any such audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals related to income taxes and other contingencies the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

we earn profits in and are therefore potentially subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions including singapore israel and the cayman islands the countries in which we earn the majority of our nonus profits due to economic political or other conditions tax rates in those jurisdictions may be subject to significant change a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in the tax rates imposed by those jurisdictions the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in stockbased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws for example proposals for fundamental united states international tax reform changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes a change in our effective tax rate can materially and adversely impact our results from operations 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements is becoming increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices or changes in interpretations of such standards practices or rules can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future changes to or revised interpretations or applications of existing tax or accounting rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business

management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements which involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured we derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems spare parts and services in general we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer when we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance we recognize revenue upon delivery and customer acceptance under certain circumstances however we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer as follows 

 in circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation 

in many instances products are sold in standalone arrangements services are sold separately through renewals of annual maintenance contracts we have multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period to determine the relative fair value of each element in a revenue arrangement we allocate arrangement consideration based on the selling price hierarchy for substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services we use vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” or thirdparty evidence “tpe” to allocate the selling price to each deliverable we determine tpe based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a standalone basis when we are unable to establish relative selling price using vsoe or tpe we use estimated selling price “esp” in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis esp could potentially be used for new or customized products we regularly review relative selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates in a multiple element revenue arrangement we defer revenue recognition associated with the relative fair value of each undelivered element until that element is delivered to the customer to be considered a separate element the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting which means that such product or service must fulfill the following criteria a the delivered items has value to the customer on a standalone basis and b if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control if the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer 

tradein rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases we estimate the value of the tradein right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale this amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the tradein right or the expiration of the tradein right 

 37 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract including consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured 

we sell standalone software that is subject to the software revenue recognition guidance we periodically review selling prices to determine whether vsoe exists and in situations where we are unable to establish vsoe for undelivered elements such as postcontract service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for 12  months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences 

the deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to certain customers in japan to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to such customers in japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance 

we enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units additionally judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or market demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

warranty  we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12  months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses utilizing actual service records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge we update these estimated charges on a regular basis the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

allowance for doubtful accounts  a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to record additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

 38 

stockbased compensation  we account for stockbased awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards the fair value of stockbased awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period the fair value for restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units the fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date the award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests ie the award holder is entitled to receive credits payable in cash or shares of our common stock equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award the fair value is determined using a blackscholes valuation model for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan the blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of assumptions including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the marketbased historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock we have elected not to include the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and therefore recognize the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs 

accounting for cashbased longterm incentive compensation  cashbased longterm incentive “cash lti” awards issued to employees under our cash lti program vest in four  equal installments with 25  of the aggregate amount of the cash lti award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four year period in order to receive payments under a cash lti award participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date compensation expense related to the cash lti awards is recognized over the vesting term which is adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures 

contingencies and litigation  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” and note 14 “litigation and other legal matters” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

goodwill and intangible assets  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable longlived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable see note 6 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination we performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit in our second quarter of fiscal year ended june 30 2015  and concluded that there was no impairment there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test the next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30 2016  

if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions we may be required to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment analysis in addition if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets we may be required to record goodwill andor intangible asset impairment charges in future periods it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or if it does whether such charge would be material to our results of operations 

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 

 39 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed within the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

valuation of marketable securities our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration of the investment the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment default and loss rates of the underlying collateral structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

effects of recent accounting pronouncements 

          recently adopted 

in july 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an accounting standard update that provides guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists under this accounting standard update in most circumstances an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in our financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward this accounting standard update became effective for our interim period ended september 30 2014 and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standard update regarding stockbased compensation that clarifies the accounting treatment when terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period ends the update requires that a performance target that affects vesting that could be achieved after the requisite service period ends be treated as a performance condition the update is effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2017 with early adoption permitted we early adopted this accounting standard update in the third quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30 2015 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update regarding simplification of the presentation of debt issuance costs which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30 2017 earlier adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued and we are required to apply the guidance on a retrospective basis with additional disclosure requirements upon transition we early adopted this accounting standard update in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30 2015 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 40 

updates not yet effective 

in may 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standard update regarding revenue from customer contracts to transfer goods and services or nonfinancial assets unless the contracts are covered by other standards for example insurance or lease contracts under the new guidance an entity should recognize revenue in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services in addition the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers the updates are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2018 in july 2015 the fasb announced a deferral of the effective date by one year with early adoption on the original effective date permitted the new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standard update for customer’s cloud based fees the guidance changes what a customer must consider in determining whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license if the arrangement contains a software license the customer would account for the fees related to the software license element in accordance with guidance related to internal use software if the arrangement does not contain a software license the customer would account for the arrangement as a service contract the update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2017 with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements 

in july 2015 the fasb issued an accounting standard update for the subsequent measurement of inventory the amended guidance requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation the requirement would replace the current lower of cost or market evaluation and the accounting guidance is unchanged for inventory measured using lastin firstout “lifo” or the retail inventory method the update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2018 with early adoption permitted to be applied prospectively we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements 

executive summary 

klatencor corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries our broad portfolio of defect inspection and metrology products and related service software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process from research and development to final volume production we provide leadingedge equipment software and support that enable ic manufacturers to identify resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost in addition to serving the semiconductor industry we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries including the led and data storage industries as well as general materials research 

our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer ic lithography reticle “reticle” or “mask” and disk manufacturers around the world our products services and expertise are used by our customers to measure detect analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes our revenues are driven largely by our customers’ spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets  memory foundry and logic all three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in enduser demand which influence the level and pattern of our customers’ spending on our products and services although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics communications data processing and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions particularly in the foundry and logic markets which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market 

 41 

as we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability as our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings we are also subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries the timing length intensity and volatility of the capacityoriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable 

the semiconductor industry has also been characterized by constant technological innovation the growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices in mobile consumer products has caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity on the other hand higher design costs for the most advanced ics could economically constrain leadingedge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications we believe that over the long term our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications that fuel demand for process control equipment although the growth for such equipment may be adversely impacted by higher design costs for advanced ics reuse of installed products and delays in production ramps by our customers in response to higher costs and technical challenges at more advanced technology nodes 

the demand for our products and our revenue levels are driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate advanced ics that are incorporated into sophisticated mobile devices the timing for our customers in ordering and taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment is also determined by our customers’ requirements to meet the next generation production ramp schedules and the timing for capacity expansion to meet end customer demand our earnings will depend not only on our revenue levels but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers’ technology roadmaps we have maintained production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventoryrelated and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate over the past year our customers have taken delivery of lower volumes of process control equipment that we had expected any delay or push out by our customers in taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment may cause earnings volatility due to increases in the risk of inventory related charges as well as timing of revenue recognition due to expiration of credits or volume discounts which if not used by a stipulated time frame will expire 

during the most recent quarter we implemented a plan to reduce our global employee workforce aimed at streamlining our organization and business processes in response to the changing customer requirements in our industry the goals of this reduction are to enable continued innovation direct our resources toward our best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate we expect to substantially complete the global employee workforce reduction by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 but certain reductions will occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016  

the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years   



total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  decreased by 4 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  revenue decreases from sales of both our defect inspection and metrology products for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 reflected our customers’ decline in capital spending for process control equipment due to shifts in the timing of the new technology ramps and capacityrelated expansion plans 

total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  increased by 3 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  as our customers continued to invest in process control and services to improve manufacturing yields as they adopt advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules required to fabricate advanced ics

revenues and gross margin   



product revenues 

our business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles in the preceding period 

product revenues decreased by 7 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  primarily as a result of lower revenues from our customers in taiwan certain countries in asia and europe and israel partially offset by higher revenues from our customers in north america korea and japan the decline in revenues was impacted by the timing of development and new technology ramps of our customers as well as the lower shipments of our products particularly to our foundry customers in taiwan due to timing of capacityrelated expansion plans 

product revenues increased by 2 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  as our customers increased their investments in defect inspection capabilities to address the yield challenges caused by the introduction of new technologies and architectures and added production capacity to meet the growing needs for advanced ics demanded in an environment of rising global demand for mobile devices 

service revenues 

service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period the amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems but it is also impacted by other factors such as our rate of service contract renewals the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended june 30 2013  2014  and 2015  primarily as a result of an increase over time in the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over that time period 

revenues  top customers 

the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the indicated periods 

 43 

revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows 

a significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that trend to continue 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions 

the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage 

changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues it also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements this includes the impact of capacity utilization use of overtime and variability of cost structure changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk 

our gross margin decreased to 568  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  from 579  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  primarily due to lower volume of products and services as well as a reduction in manufacturing efficiencies driven by lower manufacturing output and severancerelated expenses a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 refer to note 15 “restructuring charges” for additional details the above decreases were partially offset by a favorable mix of products and services sold and efficiencies derived from other service and manufacturing costs 

 44 

our gross margin increased to 579  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  from 565  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  primarily due to lower charges for inventory obsolescence as well as manufacturing and service efficiencies partially offset by a less favorable mix of products and services sold 

engineering research and development “rd”   



rd expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our focused rd efforts that are aligned with our overall business strategy historically our rd expenses have generally increased over time primarily due to higher costs associated with advanced product and technology development projects we incur significant costs associated with these projects including compensation for engineering talent engineering material costs and other expenses as technological innovation is essential to our success one of the goals of our plan to reduce our global employee workforce is to streamline our organization and business processes and direct our resources toward our best opportunities 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  were lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  primarily due to a decrease in engineering materials and consulting costs of 198 million associated with the completion of major platform developments a decrease in depreciation expense of 21 million and a decrease in travel expenses of 12 million this was partially offset by an increase in employeerelated expenses of 106 million mainly as a result of our severancerelated expenses a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 refer to note 15 “restructuring charges” for additional details in addition the decrease was partially offset by a 63 million reduction in external funding used to offset the cost of rd activities 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 418 million as a result of hiring additional engineering talent and an increase in travel expenses of 26 million as well as a 42 million reduction in external funding used to offset the cost of rd activities 

rd expenses include the benefit of 19 million  82 million  and 124 million  of external funding received during the fiscal years ended june 30 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our research and development we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes

selling general and administrative “sga” 



sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 83 million mainly as a result of severancerelated expenses a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 refer to note 15 “restructuring charges” for additional details an increase in cost of support for sales evaluation of 65 million an increase in certain expenses of 25 million as a result of our onetime leveraged recapitalization expense that was completed in the three months ended december 31 2014 a payment related to a contractual settlement for 20 million an increase due to the impairment charge recorded for certain longlived assets of 17 million and an increase in legal fees of 16 million in addition during the three months ended december 31 2013 sga expenses were favorably impacted by our receipt of 11 million in proceeds from a class action settlement as well as our recovery of 11 million in receivables that had previously been classified as a bad debt expense during the three months ended december 31 2013 both of which resulted in a decrease of our sga expense for the fiscal year ended june 30 2014 the increases described above were partially offset by a decrease in travel related expenses of 43 million and a decrease in marketingrelated expenses of 19 million 

sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  were slightly lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  primarily due to lower levels of consulting expenses of 45 million and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets of 26 million as some intangible assets became fully amortized this was partially offset by an increase in employeerelated expenses of 44 million as a result of hiring additional personnel 

restructuring charges 

in april 2015 we announced a plan to reduce our global employee workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirement in our industry the goals of this reduction are to enable continued innovation direct our resources toward our best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate we expect to recognize significant cost savings from a number of activities we have recently undertaken including estimated annual cost savings of approximately 100 million  of employee related costs as a result of our announced global employee workforce reduction during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 we recorded a 316 million  net restructuring charge of which 80 million  was recorded to costs of revenues 111 million  to engineering research and development expense and 125 million  to selling general and administrative expense a net restructuring charge amounting to 224 million  was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended june 30 2015 a substantial majority of which was related to our global workforce reduction plan refer to note 15 “restructuring charges” for additional details 

the following table shows the activity primarily related to accrual for severance and benefits expense for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 

the accrual for severance and benefits as of june 30 2015 is expected to be paid out by the end of our fiscal quarter ending december 31 2015  

we expect to incur additional charges including additional severance costs and other related costs in connection with the completion of our global workforce reduction during the first two quarters of fiscal year 2016

interest expense and other expense income net 



the increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  was primarily attributable to the issuance of 250 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes and entry into the 750 million unsecured prepayable term loan facility during the three months ended december 31 2014  as compared to 750 million of 2018 senior notes for the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  the interest expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  remained relatively unchanged compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  

other expense income net is comprised primarily of realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts impairments associated with equity investments in privatelyheld companies interest related accruals such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations and interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio since june 30 2014  our investment balance for our marketable securities portfolio declined by 973 million as a result of our strategic decision to liquidate certain marketable securities in our investment portfolio to fund our working capital requirements with this decision our interest income earned from our investment portfolio is expected to decline and the realized gains as a result of liquidation of our investment portfolio are not expected to recur 

the decrease in other expense income net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  was primarily attributable to a net decline of 47 million in gains from the sale of equity investments in privatelyheld companies a 11 million decrease in interest income from our investment portfolio as a result of our decision to liquidate certain marketable securities and a 11 million increase in net foreign currency losses resulting from the volatility of the foreign currencies against the us dollar which was partially offset by a decrease in an impairment charge of 10 million related to an equity investment in a privatelyheld company that was deemed to be otherthantemporary impairment and an increase of 09 million of realized gains from the investment portfolio liquidation 

the increase in other expense income net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  was primarily attributable to an increase of 37 million gain from the sale of an equity investment in a privatelyheld company partially offset by an impairment charge of 14 million  recognized during the three months ended december 31 2013 related to an equity investment in a privatelyheld company that was deemed to be otherthantemporary impairment and a decrease in interest income of 13 million driven by lower interest rates 

loss on extinguishment of debt and other net 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  loss on extinguishment of debt and other net reflected a pretax net loss of 1317 million  associated with the redemption of our 750 million of 2018 senior notes during the three months ended december 31 2014  included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other net is the 12 million  gain on the nondesignated forward contract that was entered into by us in anticipation of the redemption of the 2018 senior notes which were redeemed during the three  months ended december 31 2014  refer to “note 7 debt” and “note 16 derivative instruments and hedging activities” for further details we had no loss on extinguishment of debt and other net in the fiscal years ended june 30 2014  and 2013  

 47 

provision for income taxes 

the following table provides details of income taxes 



the provision for income taxes differs from the statutory us federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates tax credits and other domestic incentives 

tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  was 157  compared to 207  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  tax expense as a percentage of income decreased primarily due to an increase in our research and development credits an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction as a percentage of income and a decrease in the percentage of income earned in the us as a result of the loss on extinguishment of debt compared to income earned outside the us in jurisdictions with lower tax rates 

tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  was 207  compared to 214  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in tax reserves and an increase in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the us in jurisdictions with lower tax rates partially offset by a decrease in our research and development credits and an increase in tax expense related to employee stock activity 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income the amount of our pretax income as business activities fluctuate nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income the domestic manufacturing deduction nontaxable or nondeductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

in the normal course of business we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us we are under a united states federal income tax examination for the fiscal year ended june 30 2013 although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

liquidity and capital resources 



cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

as of june 30 2015  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 239 billion  which is a decrease of 766 million  from june 30 2014  the decrease is primarily attributable to payment of a special cash dividend of approximately 272 billion  payment of regular quarterly cash dividends of 3248 million  payment for the redemption of our 2018 senior notes of 8774 million  payment for stock repurchases of 6029 million  payment of principal amount and prepayment of term loans and interest with respect to senior notes term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility aggregating to 983 million  payment of interest up to the redemption date with respect to our 2018 senior notes of 328 million  partially offset by net proceeds of an aggregate of 322 billion  from our issuance of senior notes borrowings under our fiveyear senior unsecured prepayable term loans under our credit facility and net proceeds from cash generated from operating activities as of june 30 2015  147 billion  of our 239 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices we currently intend to permanently reinvest 134 billion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices if however a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the united states we would be required to accrue and pay us and foreign taxes of approximately 3050 of the funds repatriated the amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated we have accrued but have not paid us taxes on the remaining cash of 1363 million of the 147 billion  held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices as such these funds can be returned to the us without accruing any additional us tax expense 

cash dividends and special cash dividend 

the total amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal years ended june 30 2015  2014  and 2013  was 3248 million  2989 million  and 2659 million  respectively the increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from 045  to 050  per share that was instituted during the three months ended september 30 2014 the amount of accrued dividends payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested restricted stock units with dividend equivalent rights was 09 million  as of june 30 2015  we did not have accrued dividends payable in the fiscal years ended june 30 2014  and 2013  these amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested restricted stock units as described in note 8 “equity and longterm incentive compensation plans” on july 14 2015  we announced that our board of directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly cash dividend from 050  to 052  per share refer to note 19 “subsequent events” for additional information regarding the quarterly cash dividend increase announced subsequent to june 30 2015

debt issuance  senior notes 

in november 2014 we issued 250 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured longterm notes collectively referred to as “senior notes” we issued the senior notes as part of the leveraged recapitalization plan under which the proceeds from the senior notes in conjunction with the proceeds from the term loans described below and cash on hand were used x to fund a special cash dividend of 1650  per share aggregating to approximately 276 billion  y to redeem 750 million  of 2018  senior notes including associated redemption premiums accrued interest and other fees and expenses and z for other general corporate purposes including repurchases of shares pursuant to our stock repurchase program the interest rate specified for each series of the senior notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if moody’s investor service inc “moody’s” or standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” or under certain circumstances a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for moody’s or sp as the case may be a “substitute rating agency” downgrades or subsequently upgrades its rating assigned to the respective series of senior notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade if the adjusted rating of any series of senior notes from moody’s or if applicable any substitute rating agency is decreased to ba1 ba2 ba3 or b1 or below the stated interest rate on such series of senior notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps 50 bps 75 bps or 100 bps respectively “bps” refers to basis points and 1 is equal to 100 bps if the rating of any series of senior notes from sp or if applicable any substitute rating agency with respect to such series of senior notes is decreased to bb bb bb or b or below the stated interest rate on such series of senior notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps 50 bps 75 bps or 100 bps respectively the interest rates on any series of senior notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any of moody’s sp and if applicable any substitute rating agency if such series of senior notes becomes rated “baa1” or its equivalent or higher by moody’s or if applicable any substitute rating agency and “bbb” or its equivalent or higher by sp or if applicable any substitute rating agency or one of those ratings if rated by only one of moody’s sp and if applicable any substitute rating agency in each case with a stable or positive outlook in october 2014 we entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10year treasury rate “benchmark rate” on a portion of the senior notes with a notional amount of 100 billion  in aggregate for additional details refer to note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” 

the original discount on the senior notes amounted to 40 million  and is being amortized over the life of the debt interest is payable semiannually  on may 1 and november 1 of each year the debt indenture the “indenture” includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on its facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted as of june 30 2015  we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the indenture associated with the senior notes 

debt issuance  credit facility term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility 

in november 2014 we entered into 750 million  of fiveyear senior unsecured prepayable term loans and a 500 million  unfunded revolving credit facility collectively the “credit facility” under the credit agreement the interest under the credit facility will be payable on the borrowed amounts at the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a spread which is currently 125 bps and this spread is subject to adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades by moody’s and sp the spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the then effective credit rating we are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades the annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility depending upon the then effective credit rating principal payments with respect to the term loans will be made on the last day of each calendar quarter and any unpaid principal balance of the term loans including accrued interest shall be payable on november 14 2019 the “maturity date” we may prepay the term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility at any time without a prepayment penalty during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended june 30 2015  the company prepaid additional principal of 200 million  in addition to the scheduled quarterly payments for the term loans

we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we periodically sell certain letters of credit “lcs” without recourse received from customers in payment for goods 

the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lcs for the indicated periods 



factoring and lc fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense income net and were not material for the periods presented 

we maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to 225 million  of which 190 million  had been issued as of june 30 2015  primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for valueadded tax “vat” and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in europe and asia 

we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecasted timehorizon can vary among different suppliers our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately 2987 million  as of june 30 2015  and are primarily due within the next 12 months actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 

we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable nonstandard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hours per week coverage for 12 months see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description

working capital was 290 billion  as of june 30 2015  which was a decrease of 7877 million  compared to our working capital as of june 30 2014  the decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to payment of a special cash dividend of approximately 272 billion  payment of regular quarterly cash dividends of 3248 million  payment for the redemption of the 2018 senior notes of 8774 million  payment for stock repurchases of 6029 million  payment of principal amount and prepayment of term loans and interest with respect to senior notes term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility aggregating to 983 million  payment of interest up to the redemption date with respect to our 2018 senior notes of 328 million  partially offset by the aggregate of net proceeds of 322 billion  from the issuance of senior notes and borrowings under our prepayable term loans as of june 30 2015  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 239 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global and regional economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our 500 million unfunded revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs capital expenditures dividends stock repurchases and other contractual obligations including repayment of outstanding debt for at least the next 12 months

our credit ratings and outlooks as of june 30 2015  are summarized below   



factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under our foreign currency risk management strategy we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates this financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months see note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description our outstanding hedge contracts with maximum maturity of 16 months were as follows   



in october 2014 in anticipation of the issuance of the senior notes we entered into a series of forward contracts “rate lock agreements” to lock the benchmark rate on a portion of the senior notes the objective of the rate lock agreements was to hedge the risk associated with the variability in interest rates due to the changes in the benchmark rate leading up to the closing of the intended financing on the notional amount being hedged the rate lock agreements had a notional amount of 1 billion  in aggregate which matured in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  we designated each of the rate lock agreements as a qualifying hedging instrument and accounted for as a cash flow hedge under which the effective portion of the gain or loss on the close out of the rate lock agreements was initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a reduction of total stockholders’ equity and subsequently amortized into earnings as a component of interest expense over the term of the underlying debt the ineffective portion if any was recognized in earnings immediately the rate lock agreements were terminated on the date of pricing of the 125 billion  of 4650  senior notes due in 2024 and we recorded the fair value of a 75 million  receivable as a gain within accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of december 31 2014  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  we recognized 05 million  for the amortization of the gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss which amount reduced the interest expense we did not record any ineffectiveness for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  the cash proceeds of 75 million  from the settlement of the rate lock agreements were included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  because the designated hedged item was classified as interest expense in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

in addition in november 2014 we entered into a nondesignated forward contract to lock the treasury rate used to determine the redemption amount of the 2018 senior notes that occurred during the three months ended december 31 2014  the objective of the forward contract was to hedge the risk associated with the variability of the redemption amount due to changes in interest rates through the redemption of the existing 2018 senior notes the forward contract had a notional amount of 750 million  the forward contract was terminated in december 2014 and the resulting fair value of 12 million  receivable was included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other net line in the consolidated statements of operations partially offsetting the loss on redemption of the debt during the three months ended december 31 2014  the cash proceeds from the forward contract were included in the cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015  partially offsetting the cash outflows for the redemption of the 2018 senior notes

indemnification obligations subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us these obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws applicable contracts and delaware and california law the obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters for example we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors officers and employees although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited we believe the fair value of this liability to the extent estimable is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings 

we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters typically these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from or provide customers with other remedies to protect against bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products noncompliance with our product performance specifications infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights used in our products and a breach of warranties representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold validity of certain intellectual property rights noninfringement of thirdparty rights and certain income taxrelated matters in each of these circumstances payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract this usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants to control the defense or settlement of any thirdparty claims brought against the other party further our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts activity typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party and duration in some instances we may have recourse against third parties andor insurance covering certain payments made by us 

in addition we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customerspecific commitments on pricing tool reliability spare parts stocking levels service response time and other commitments furthermore we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection to date we have made no accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future 

it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of june 30 2015  actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2015  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 165 billion these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in fair value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of june 30 2015  the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by 181 million 

in november 2014 we issued 250 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior unsecured longterm notes collectively referred to as “senior notes” due in various fiscal years ranging from 2018 to 2035 the fair market value of longterm fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of june 30 2015  the book value of our senior notes of 250 billion  approximates the fair value additionally the interest expense for the senior notes is subject to interest rate adjustments following a downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies following a rating change below investment grade the stated interest rate for each series of senior notes may increase between 25 bps to 100 bps based on the adjusted credit rating refer to note 7 “debt” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “liquidity and capital resources”  in part ii item 7 for additional details factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy as of june 30 2015  if our credit rating was downgraded below investment grade by moody’s and sp the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense on the senior notes considering a 200 bps increase to the stated interest rate for each series of our senior notes is estimated to be approximately 500 million 

in november 2014 we entered into 750 million  aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior unsecured prepayable term loans due in 2019 and a 500 million  unfunded revolving credit facility the interest rates for the term loans are based on libor plus a fixed spread and this spread is subject to adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades the spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the adjusted credit rating the fair value of the term loans is subject to interest rate risk only to the extent of the fixed spread portion of the interest rates which does not fluctuate with change in interest rates as of june 30 2015  the difference between book value and fair value of our term loans was immaterial we are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the unfunded revolving credit facility which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades the annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility depending upon the then effective credit rating as of june 30 2015  if liborbased interest rates increased by 100 bps the change would increase our annual interest expense annually by approximately 63 million as it relates to our borrowings under the term loans additionally as of june 30 2015  if our credit rating was downgraded to be below investment grade the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense for the term loans and the revolving credit facility using the highest range of the ranges discussed above is estimated to be approximately 41 million 

see note 4 “marketable securities” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 and risk factors in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of june 30 2015  

as of june 30 2015  we had net forward and option contracts to sell 1151 million  in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures see note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2015  the us dollar equivalent would have been 1151 million a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 239 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

industry 

general background 

the semiconductor industry is klatencor’s core focus the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is typically 150 millimeters 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish other more specialized wafers such as epitaxial silicon “epi” silicononinsulator “soi” gallium nitride “gan” and silicon carbide “sic” are also common in the semiconductor industry 

 1 

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper “interconnect” structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when all of the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality the wafer is then cut into individual devices and those chips that passed functional testing are packaged final testing is performed on all packaged chips 

current trends 

the rapid growth of consumer demand for mobile devices including smartphones tablets and wearable devices is currently driving the electronics industry and as a result the semiconductor industry as well contained within each of these latest consumer devices are advanced semiconductors that are helping enable the features consumers want in device performance such as smaller product form factors lower power requirements bigger and brighter screens and speed at a lower cost alongside this market growth the industry continues to witness a high rate of change in technology with the emergence of new techniques and architectures in production today such as threedimensional  “ 3d ”  transistors advanced patterning lithography and semiconductors with critical dimensions at 28 nanometer and below klatencors inspection and measurement technologies play a key role in enabling the success of our customers advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to highvolume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trends such as a specific design rule shrink in today’s market driven by consumer demand for lowcost electronic goods the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies some requiring new substrate and film materials new geometries and advanced lithography techniques 

while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected their adoption into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects while device performance characteristics namely speed capacity or power management become more sensitive to parameters such as line width and film thickness variation new process materials such as highk dielectrics soi wafers and immersion lithographycapable photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 5 billion substantially more than previousgeneration facilities in addition chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment 

by developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment “roi” once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume our tools help ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution in addition the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules coupled with new materials and device innovation has increased inprocess variability which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling 

 2 

klatencor systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer reticle and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems the ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes this helps them increase their yield of highperformance parts and deliver their products to market faster—thus maximizing their profit with our broad portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ nextgeneration products helping our customers respond to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes and new backend packaging techniques

customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout asia the united states and europe staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers in each of these regions 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2014  2013  and 2012  the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues 

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are aimed at building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services our customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility that are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier for multiple products and services our revenues are derived primarily from product sales mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in asia the united states and europe we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2014  we employed approximately 2411 sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of whollyowned subsidiaries or branches in other countries including belgium china france germany hong kong india israel italy japan singapore south korea taiwan and the united kingdom international revenues accounted for approximately 76  70  and 79  of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended june 30 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 17 “segment reporting and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

 9 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in nonus dollar product sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in item 1a “risk factors” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our shipment backlog for systems and associated warranty totaled 977 million and 817 million as of june 30 2014  and 2013  respectively and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received and the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months orders for service contracts and unreleased products are excluded from shipment backlog all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer often with limited or no penalties we make adjustments for shipment backlog obtained from acquired companies sales order cancellations customer delivery date changes and currency adjustments shipment backlog is not subject to normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our basic financial statements in addition the concept of shipment backlog is not defined in the accounting literature making comparisons between periods and with other companies difficult and potentially misleading 

our revenue backlog which includes the gross value of sales orders where physical deliveries have been completed but for which revenue has not been recognized pursuant to our policy for revenue recognition totaled 269 million and 271 million as of june 30 2014  and 2013  respectively orders for service contracts are excluded from revenue backlog 

because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between on the one hand our ability to manufacture deliver and install products and on the other the requirements of our customers in our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources management of our operating model and other factors we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries and installations of products which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products 

research and development 

the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs in addition we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby certain government agencies or other third parties fund a portion of our research and development costs as of june 30 2014  we employed approximately 1537 research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  involved the development of process control and yield management equipment aimed at addressing the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes and new backend packaging techniques for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

 10 

the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product research and development even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to enhance our competitive position new product introductions however may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products and if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in the united states milpitas california singapore israel germany and china as of june 30 2014  we employed approximately 1010 manufacturing personnel 

some critical parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications while other parts are standard commercial products we use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers through our business interruption planning we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by among other things monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources or disruptions within our suppliers oftencomplex supply chains could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have such as applied materials inc asml holding nv and hitachi hightechnologies corporation we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability interoperability with the existing installed base and technical service and support as well as overall cost of ownership 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions and alliances 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

 11 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment including without limitation the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial condition results of operations or competitive position 

however any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of june 30 2014  we employed approximately 6060 people except for our employees in belgium where a trade union delegation recently came into being following a formal request thereto by the representative unions which we did not challenge and our employees in the german operations of our mie business unit who are represented by an employee work council none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees

risk factors 

tableend 

a description of factors that could materially affect our business financial condition or operating results is provided below 

risks associated with our industry 

ongoing changes in the technology industry as well as the semiconductor industry in particular could expose our business to significant risks 

the semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve pricing trends in the endmarkets for consumer electronics and other products which place a growing emphasis on our customers cost of ownership changes in our customers capital spending patterns and in general an environment of constant change and development including decreasing product and component dimensions use of new materials and increasingly complex device structures applications and process steps if we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends or with respect to technological advances if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry as the significant majority of our sales are made to semiconductor manufacturers some of the trends that our management monitors in operating our business include the following 

 any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers’ rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce which could result in downward pressure on our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

 15 

we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been and is becoming increasingly highly concentrated in this environment orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales this increasing concentration exposes our business financial condition and operating results to a number of risks including the following 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict the cyclical nature of the primary industry in which we operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization consumer demand for products inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital this cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in or cancellation or delay of orders which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customers funding status which could be weakened not only by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or companyspecific reasons but also by funding limitations imposed by the customers unique corporate structure any of these factors could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

 16 

when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues as was experienced during fiscal year 2009 we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results then our business could be seriously harmed furthermore any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

in addition our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics which when made are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time however largely due to the cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles our actual results may vary and have varied in the past from forecasted results these variations can occur for any number of reasons including but not limited to unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders product shipments or product acceptances an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to adapt to changing business conditions or a different than anticipated effective tax rate the impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment this is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues but also due to the advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order in order to meet the expected lead times to significant inventory writeoffs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided we provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of managements expectations for the future but parties reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of and are themselves forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this item 1a and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements if our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts or if we revise our forecasts the market price of our common stock could decline 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions for example the size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink and the industry is currently transitioning to the use of new materials and innovative fab processes while we expect these trends will increase our customers’ reliance on diagnostic products such as ours we cannot be sure that these trends will directly improve our business these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards to develop and introduce new products that successfully address changing customer needs to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner 

in this environment we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance features and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

 17 

in addition the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks we regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer even before receiving the customers formal acceptance of that product in certain situations including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted however our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents all of which must perform to their respective specifications so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall products required specifications in such a situation the customer may be entitled to certain remedies which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and as a result our stock price 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business in addition we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects the termination of any such collaboration or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration could significantly impair our research and development efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of continuing significant investments in product research and development however we may enter new markets whether through acquisitions or new internal product development in which competition is based primarily on product pricing not technological superiority further some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

 18 

our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing through our business interruption planning we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by among other things monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers also key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers’ proprietary intellectual property in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for highperformance hightechnology components which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products in addition if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations which is a heightened risk during economic downturns that would affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products similarly especially with respect to suppliers of hightechnology components our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in a timely manner and result in delays for our products our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms furthermore a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons including the suppliers financial condition or business operational decisions which would require us to purchase in a single transaction a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers such “endoflife” parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory writeoff in a future period either of which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods 

if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan our operating results business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted 

we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually revised frequently generally quarterly and reviewed by management even more frequently at least monthly our business plan is developed based on a number of factors many of which require estimates and assumptions such as our expectations of the economic environment future business levels our customers’ willingness and ability to place orders leadtimes and future revenue and cash flow our budgeted operating expenses for example are based in part on our future revenue expectations however our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors including the volatile and cyclical nature of our primary industry customer order cancellations macroeconomic changes operational matters regarding particular agreements our ability to manage customer deliveries and resources for the installation and acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to manage delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a 

because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results similarly if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period which would also negatively affect our results of operations if we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted such an outcome could cause customers suppliers or investors to view us as less stable or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

in addition our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources the need to manage our operating model and other factors in furtherance of those efforts we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries installations and payment scheduling any such decisions may impact our ability to recognize revenue including the fiscal period during which such revenue may be recognized with respect to such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or stock price

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors first instituted a quarterly dividend during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 since that time we have announced a number of increases in the amount of our quarterly dividend level we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends may be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws and changes to our business model our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

there are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness 

as of june 30 2014  we had 750 million  aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness represented by our senior notes that will mature in 2018 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and the other risk factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities factors that can affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of our senior notes we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of the senior notes our ability to repurchase the senior notes in such event may be limited by law by the indenture associated with the senior notes or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time if we fail to repurchase the senior notes as required by the indenture it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations 

we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions including our indemnification of third parties as well as the performance of our products 

although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties costly and timeconsuming litigation or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes or could impact our revenue or cost recognition any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in our commercial agreements from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and lessors with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes in addition notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations whether or not asserted due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

 20 

we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects especially when products are first introduced unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us including increased service or warranty costs providing product replacements for or modifications to defective products litigation related to defective products reimbursement for damages caused by our products product recalls or product writeoffs or disposal costs these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business financial condition and operating results in addition our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

furthermore we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives such as credits toward future purchases we believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our longterm business as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase higher volumes of our products however these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives as a result these volume purchase arrangements while expected to be beneficial to our business over time could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in nearterm periods including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and therefore our gross margins 

in addition we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain other types of customerspecific pricing discount rebate or credit commitments offered by us which may adversely impact our revenues margins or financial results furthermore we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection to date we have made no accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future one significant customer recently exercised its audit rights but we cannot predict the outcome of that audit at this time our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in supporting an audit or inspection or defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

there are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development 

we are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies both domestically and internationally governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion or a project may be terminated by mutual agreement if the parties determine that the projects goals or milestones are not being achieved so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future in addition under the terms of these government grants the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur directly and indirectly in connection with such programs any such audit could result in modifications to or even termination of the applicable government funding program for example if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program those costs would not be reimbursed and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded we do not know the outcome of any future audits any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties financial or otherwise termination of funding programs suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency any of which could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

 21 

we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our business 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we recorded material restructuring charges of 387 million related to our global workforce reduction large excess inventory writeoffs of 856 million and material impairment charges of 4467 million related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets if we again encounter challenging economic conditions we may implement additional cost reduction actions discontinue certain business operations or make other organizational changes which would require us to take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to among other things employee terminations or exit costs we may also be required to writeoff additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline also as our lead times from suppliers increase due to the increasing complexity of the parts and components they provide and the lead times demanded by our customers decrease due to the time pressures they face when introducing new products or technology or bringing new facilities into production we may be compelled to increase our commitments and therefore our risk exposure to inventory purchases to meet our customers demands in a timely manner and that inventory may need to be writtenoff if demand for the underlying product declines for any reason such additional writeoffs could constitute material charges 

as noted above we recorded a material charge during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using the straightline method and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for longlived assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and as applicable the amount of any previous impairment charge could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge 

any such additional material charges whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements 

we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements 

we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions any of which may prove not to be financially viable if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables however by entering into these arrangements and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services we are exposed to additional risks if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered 

in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws if we were to violate any such law we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 22 

general commercial operational financial and regulatory risks 

we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy 

the severe tightening of the credit markets turmoil in the financial markets and weakening of the global economy that were experienced during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 contributed to slowdowns in the industries in which we operate which slowdowns could recur or worsen if economic conditions were to deteriorate again 

the markets for semiconductors and therefore our business are ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending which caused our customers to decrease cancel or delay their equipment and service orders from us in the economic slowdown during fiscal year 2009 in addition the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell reduced demand combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of such financing has at times in the past adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels 

in addition a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and where applicable credit ratings and government guarantees of the underlying investments a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity if the market value of such investments were to decline or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges including but not limited to 

 any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

 23 

we might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property or other confidential information that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information in addition we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties with respect to intellectual property infringement disputes our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition furthermore we may potentially be subject to claims by customers suppliers or other business partners or by governmental law enforcement agencies related to our receipt distribution andor use of thirdparty intellectual property or confidential information legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit and associated internal investigations with respect to intellectual property or confidential information disputes are often expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert managements attention and other company resources andor may result in restrictions on our ability to sell our products settlements on significantly adverse terms or adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines any of which could have a significant negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings claims or investigations the instigation of legal proceedings or claims our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims or the determination of any adverse findings against us or any of our employees in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our business reputation 

we are exposed to various risks related to the legal including environmental regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to compliance with new existing different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust anticorruptionantibribery unclaimed property and export control regulations our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws rules or regulations or changes to existing laws rules or regulations including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business from time to time we may receive inquiries or audit notices from governmental or regulatory bodies or we may participate in voluntary disclosure programs related to legal regulatory or tax compliance matters and these inquiries notices or programs may result in significant financial cost including investigation expenses defense costs assessments and penalties reputational harm and other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations including those that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental regulations including regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute potentially more expensive andor rarer materials further we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by any release regardless of fault we also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the materials composition of our products including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources of certain metals and other materials the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business 

 24 

in addition we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment contracts product performance product liability antitrust environmental regulations securities unfair competition and other matters in addition to proceedings and claims related to intellectual property matters which are separately discussed elsewhere in this item 1a these legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit our ability to sell our products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims which could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

recent regulations related to “conflict minerals” may force us to incur additional expenses may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 

in august 2012 under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the sec adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as “conflict minerals” regardless of their actual country of origin in their products some of these metals are commonly used in electronic equipment and devices including our products these new requirements require companies to annually investigate disclose and report whether or not such metals originated from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries our first report was filed on june 2 2014 for the 2013 calendar year we have an extremely complex supply chain with numerous suppliers many of whom are not obligated by the new law to investigate their own supply chains for the components and parts used in each of our products as a result we may incur significant costs to comply with the diligence and disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant metals used in our products in addition because our supply chain is so complex we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origin of all the relevant metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our business reputation though we do not anticipate that our customers will need to know our conflict mineral status to satisfy their own sec reporting obligations if any we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers if they nonetheless require that we prove or certify that our products are “conflict free” key components and parts that can be shown to be “conflict free” may not be available to us in sufficient quantity or at all or may only be available at significantly higher cost to us if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier any of these outcomes could adversely impact our business financial condition or operating results 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future our business and operations could be harmed 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting functions to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations in addition many of these outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage employ “cloud computing” technology for such storage which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the users physical infrastructure but instead is delivered to and consumed by the user as an internetbased service these providers cloud computing systems may be susceptible to “cyber incidents” such as intentional cyber attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cybersecurity compromises that are outside of our control if we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as anticipated or do not adequately protect our data from cyberrelated security breaches or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes we may experience operational difficulties such as limitations on our ability to ship products increased costs manufacturing or service interruptions or delays loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data quality and compliance issues and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 25 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations 

our global operations are linked by information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications despite our implementation of network security measures our tools and servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems and tools located at customer sites or could be subject to system failures or malfunctions for other reasons system failures or malfunctioning such as difficulties with our customer relationship management “crm” system could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results our enterprise resource planning “erp” system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records record transactions provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems whether in connection with the regular operation periodic enhancements modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any such event could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than anticipated in addition we may lose key employees of the acquired companies as a result risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons including 

 at times we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary highly sensitive information the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

 26 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations or in the operations of our customers due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states singapore israel germany and china in addition our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors as well as our other operations and those of our customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fire earthquake volcanic eruptions energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites we cannot ensure that alternate means of conducting our operations whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if such alternate means were available they could be obtained on favorable terms 

in addition as part of our costcutting actions we have consolidated several operating facilities our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above such as acts of war or terrorism earthquakes fires or other natural disasters if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at or acts of war in the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business increased international political instability in various parts of the world disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations we maintain significant manufacturing and research and development operations in israel an area that has historically experienced a high degree of political instability and we are therefore exposed to risks associated with future instability in that region such instability could directly impact our ability to operate our business or our customers ability to operate their businesses in the affected region cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate such instability could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we selfinsure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain risks are uninsurable are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance accordingly we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds the applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy for example we do not currently hold earthquake insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations a significant portion of which are conducted in california an area highly susceptible to earthquakes it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products much of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we selfinsure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also selfinsured either based on a similar costbenefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

 27 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the euro and the japanese yen we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally in addition an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the united states and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected furthermore if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge we may experience material financial losses 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments impairment of our investments could harm our earnings in addition we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that have a maximum effective maturity of three years the longer the duration of these securities the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields as market interest rates and bond yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity however an impairment of the fair market value of our investments even if unrealized must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

in addition the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets our operating results or other performance metrics or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies 

we are exposed to risks in connection with tax and regulatory compliance audits in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits such as related to customs or product safety requirements in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes penalties fines or other prohibitions against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that our products and practices comply with applicable regulations the final determination of any such audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals related to income taxes and other contingencies the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

we earn profits in and are therefore potentially subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions including singapore israel and the cayman islands the countries in which we earn the majority of our nonus profits due to economic political or other conditions tax rates in those jurisdictions may be subject to significant change a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in the tax rates imposed by those jurisdictions the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in stockbased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws for example proposals for fundamental united states international tax reform changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes a change in our effective tax rate can materially and adversely impact our results from operations 

 28 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements is becoming increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices or changes in interpretations of such standards practices or rules can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future changes to or revised interpretations or applications of existing tax or accounting rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements which involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured we derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems spare parts and services in general we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer when a customer delays installation for delivered products for which we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance under certain circumstances however we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer as follows 

 in circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation 

in many instances products are sold in standalone arrangements services are sold separately through renewals of annual maintenance contracts we also allow for multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period to determine the relative fair value of each element in a revenue arrangement we allocate arrangement consideration based on the selling price hierarchy for substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services we use vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” or thirdparty evidence “tpe” to allocate the selling price to each deliverable we determine tpe based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a standalone basis when we are unable to establish relative selling price using vsoe or tpe we use estimated selling price “esp” in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis esp could potentially be used for new or customized products we regularly review relative selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates in a multiple element revenue arrangement we defer revenue recognition associated with the relative fair value of each undelivered element until that element is delivered to the customer to be considered a separate element the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting which means that such product or service must fulfill the following criteria a the delivered items has value to the customer on a standalone basis and b if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control if the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer 

 35 

tradein rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases we estimate the value of the tradein right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale this amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the tradein right or the expiration of the tradein right 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract including consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured 

we sell standalone software that is subject to the software revenue recognition guidance we periodically review selling prices to determine whether vsoe exists and in some situations where we are unable to establish vsoe for undelivered elements such as postcontract service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for 12  months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences 

the deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to certain customers in japan to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to such customers in japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance 

we enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units additionally judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or market demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on forecasted usage these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

warranty  we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12  months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses utilizing actual service records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge we update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

 36 

allowance for doubtful accounts  a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to record additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

stockbased compensation  we account for stockbased awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards the fair value of stockbased awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period the fair value is determined using a blackscholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan the blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of assumptions including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the marketbased historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock the fair value for restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units the fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date the award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests ie the award holder is entitled to receive credits payable in cash or shares of our common stock equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award we have elected not to include the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and therefore recognize the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs 

accounting for cashbased longterm incentive compensation  cashbased longterm incentive “cash lti” awards issued to employees under our cash lti program vest in four  equal installments with 25  of the aggregate amount of the cash lti award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four year period in order to receive payments under a cash lti award participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date compensation expense related to the cash lti awards is recognized over the vesting term which is adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures 

contingencies and litigation  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” and note 14 “litigation and other legal matters” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

goodwill and intangible assets  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable longlived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable see note 6 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination we performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit in our second quarter of fiscal year 2014  and concluded that there was no impairment there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test the next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30 2015  

if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions we may be required to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment analysis in addition if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets we may be required to record goodwill andor intangible asset impairment charges in future periods it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or if it does whether such charge would be material to our results of operations 

 37 

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed within the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

valuation of marketable securities our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration of the investment the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment default and loss rates of the underlying collateral structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

effects of recent accounting pronouncements 

          recently adopted 

in december 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update requiring enhanced disclosure about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement we adopted the disclosure requirement in the first quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30 2014 and it did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2013 the fasb issued an accounting standard update on the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income of various components which was originally deferred by the fasb in december 2011 the february 2013 update did not change the then current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements however this update required an entity to present parenthetically on the face of the financial statements in the notes or in some cases crossreferenced to related footnote disclosures significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification the amendment reflected in the february 2013 update was adopted by us in the first quarter of our fiscal year ended june 30 2014 and it did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as it was disclosureonly in nature

updates not yet effective 

in july 2013 the fasb issued an accounting standard update that provides explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists under the new standard update in most circumstances an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in a companys financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward this accounting standard update will be effective for our interim period ending september 30 2014 and applied prospectively with early adoption permitted we do not anticipate that this accounting standard update will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

in may 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standard update regarding revenue from customer contracts to transfer goods and services or nonfinancial assets unless the contracts are covered by other standards for example insurance or lease contracts under the new guidance an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the updates are effective for us beginning the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2018 early adoption is not permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standard update regarding stockbased compensation that clarifies the accounting when terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period the amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting which could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition the update is effective for us beginning the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2017 with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements 

executive summary 

klatencor corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries our broad portfolio of defect inspection and metrology products and related service software and other offerings primarily supports ic manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process from research and development to final volume production we provide leadingedge equipment software and support that enable ic manufacturers to identify resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost in addition to serving the semiconductor industry we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries including led and data storage industries as well as general materials research 

our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer ic lithography reticle “reticle” or “mask” and disk manufacturers around the world our products services and expertise are used by our customers to measure and control nanometriclevel manufacturing processes and to detect analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment our revenues are driven largely by our customers spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets  memory foundry and logic all three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in enduser demand which influence the level and pattern of our customers spending on our products and services although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics communications data processing and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions 

as we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability as our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings in addition we are subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries the timing length intensity and volatility of the capacityoriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable 

 39 

however in addition to these trends of consolidation and cyclicality the semiconductor industry has also been significantly impacted by constant technological innovation the growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices has caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity these investments have included process control and yield management equipment and services and have had a significant favorable impact on our revenues over the long term 

over the past four years we have experienced high levels of customer demand for our products a result of growth in increasingly sophisticated mobile devices incorporating advanced ics the demand for our products is driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate these advanced ics we cannot predict the duration and sustainability of the recent favorable business conditions and our revenue levels in the next fiscal year will depend upon whether our customers maintain recent levels of investment in process control equipment our earnings for the next fiscal year will depend not only on our revenue levels but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers technology roadmaps we have continued to scale our production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventoryrelated and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate we believe that over the long term our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications as well as to reduce cost we expect particularly among our foundry and logic customers that this in turn will drive high levels of longterm adoption of process control equipment and services that reduce semiconductor defectivity and improve manufacturing yields reinforcing the longerterm growth drivers in our industry 

the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years   



total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  increased by 3 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  as our customers continued to invest in process control and services to improve manufacturing yields as they adopt advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules required to fabricate advanced ics 

total revenues during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2012 revenue decreases from sales of both our defect inspection and metrology products for the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  reflected typical cyclicality in capacityoriented capital spending by logic and memory chip manufacturers as well as delays in the procurement of nextgeneration equipment required to facilitate the transition to extreme ultraviolet lithography 

revenues and gross margin   



product revenues 

our business is affected by the increasingly concentrated nature of our semiconductor manufacturer customer base and the cyclicality of the capital equipment procurement practices of those manufacturers with revenues directly impacted by their investment patterns our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and due to the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles in the preceding periods 

 40 

product revenues increased by 2 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  as our customers increased their investments in defect inspection capabilities to address the yield challenges caused by the introduction of new technologies and architectures and added production capacity to meet the growing needs for advanced ics demanded in an environment of rising global demand for mobile devices 

product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  as a result of a decline in overall semiconductor industry capital spending revenue decreases from sales of both our defect inspection and metrology products reflected typical cyclicality in capacityoriented capital spending by logic and memory chip manufacturers as well as delays in the procurement of nextgeneration equipment required to facilitate the transition to extreme ultraviolet lithography 

service revenues 

service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period the amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems but it is also impacted by other factors such as our rate of service contract renewals the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended june 30 2012  2013  and 2014  as a result of an increase in the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers sites over that time period 

revenues  top customers 

the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the indicated periods 

revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows 

a significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that trend to continue 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions 

 41 

the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage 

changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues it also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements this includes the impact of capacity utilization use of overtime and variability of cost structure changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk 

our gross margin increased to 579  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  from 565  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  primarily due to lower charges for inventory obsolescence as well as manufacturing and service efficiencies partially offset by a less favorable mix of products and services sold 

our gross margin decreased to 565  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  from 581  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  primarily due to lower revenue volume partially offset by a more favorable mix of products and certain manufacturing efficiencies 

engineering research and development “rd”   



our rd expenses have generally increased over time including significant increases over the past two fiscal years primarily due to higher costs associated with advanced product and technology development projects we incur significant costs associated with these projects including compensation for engineering talent engineering material costs and other expenses as technological innovation is essential to our success during certain periods rd expenses may fluctuate relative to product development phases and project timing 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 418 million as a result of hiring additional engineering talent and an increase in travel expenses of 26 million as well as a 42 million reduction in external funding used to offset the cost of rd activities 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  primarily due to the stage and timing of our development projects as described above rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  were impacted by an increase in engineering material and depreciation of 261 million and an increase in employeerelated expenses of 90 million as a result of additional engineering headcount 

 42 

rd expenses include the benefit of 82 million  124 million  and 69 million  of external funding received during the fiscal years ended june 30 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes 

selling general and administrative “sga” 

  



sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  were slightly lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  primarily due to lower levels of consulting expenses of 45 million and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets of 26 million as some intangible assets became fully amortized this was partially offset by an increase in employeerelated expenses of 44 million as a result of hiring additional personnel 

sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  primarily due to an increase of 57 million in support costs related to product demonstrations and evaluations of our product by customers as well as depreciation expense an increase of 36 million in travel expenses due to the increasingly global nature of our customers operations and business an increase of 21 million in employeerelated compensation as a result of annual compensation adjustments and additional headcount and 31 million in goodwill impairment severance and other expenses that we recognized during the three months ended september 30 2012 in connection with our decision to exit from the solar inspection business 

interest income and other net and interest expense 



interest income and other net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities gains or losses from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts impairments associated with equity investments in privatelyheld companies and interest related accruals such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations the increase in interest income and other net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  was primarily attributable to an increase of 37 million from the sale of an equity investment in a privatelyheld company partially offset by an impairment charge of 14 million  recognized during the three months ended december 31 2013 related to an equity investment in a privatelyheld company that was deemed to be otherthantemporary impairment and a decrease in interest income of 13 million driven by lower interest rates 

the increase in interest income and other net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  was primarily attributable to a decrease in impairment charges of 29 million  for equity investments in privatelyheld companies an increase in realized gains of marketable securities of 12 million and an increase in foreign exchange related gains of 19 million partially offset by an increase of 42 million in interest and penalty accruals related to uncertain tax positions 

interest expense is primarily attributable to the 750 million  aggregate principal amount of senior fixed rate notes that we issued in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

 43 

provision for income taxes 

the following table provides details of income taxes 



the provision for income taxes differs from the statutory us federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates the tax effects of employee stock activity tax credits and state taxes 

tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  was 207  compared to 214  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in tax reserves and an increase in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the us in jurisdictions with lower tax rates partially offset by a decrease in our research and development credits and an increase in tax expense related to employee stock activity 

tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  was 214  compared to 224  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in the tax effects of employee stock activity an increase in tax credits and an increase in the domestic manufacturing benefit offset by an increase in tax reserves 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income the amount of our pretax income as business activities fluctuate nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income the domestic manufacturing deduction nontaxable or nondeductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

we had cumulative windfalls in excess of shortfalls of approximately 234 million  and 69 million  during each of the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  and 2013  we incurred 119 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal years ended june 30 2012  due to shortfalls from employee stock activity windfall tax benefits arise when a companys tax deduction for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity a shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value shortfalls are recorded as decreases to capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes 

for the fiscal year ending june 30 2015  we do not expect shortfalls from employee stock activity to have an impact on our tax rate because we do not expect shortfalls to be in excess of cumulative windfalls 

in the normal course of business we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

liquidity and capital resources 



as of june 30 2014  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 32 billion  which is an increase of 234 million  from june 30 2013  as of june 30 2014  13 billion  of our 32 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices we currently intend to permanently reinvest 11 billion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices if however a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the united states we would be required to accrue and pay us and foreign taxes of approximately 3050 of the funds repatriated the amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated we have accrued but have not paid us taxes on the remaining cash of 152 million of the 13 billion  held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices as such these funds can be returned to the us without accruing any additional us tax expense 

the total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended june 30 2014  2013  and 2012  was 299 million  266 million  and 234 million  respectively the increase in the amount of dividends paid during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  compared to the preceding fiscal year reflects the increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from 040  to 045  per share that was instituted during the three months ended september 30 2013  on july 8 2014 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from 045  to 050  per share 

on july 8 2014 we also announced that our board of directors had authorized us to repurchase up to 13 million  additional shares under our stock repurchase program 

the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding the decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of employee restricted stock units and in connection with stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

we have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations 

fiscal year 2014  compared to fiscal year 2013 

net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  from 913 million  to 779 million  primarily as a result of the following key factors 

  45 

net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  from 241 million  to 676 million  primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of availableforsale and trading securities net of sales and maturities of approximately 424 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  in addition we acquired a privatelyheld company for a total purchase consideration of 18 million  in cash during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june 30 2014    



  

 starting in fiscal year 2013 we adopted a cashbased longterm incentive “cash lti” program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program cash lti awards issued to employees under the cash longterm incentive plan “cash lti plan” generally vest in four equal installments with 25 of the aggregate amount of the cash lti award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a fouryear period in order to receive payments under the cash lti plan participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date 

we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we periodically sell certain letters of credit “lcs” without recourse received from customers in payment for goods 

the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lcs for the indicated periods 



factoring and lc fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in interest income and other net and were not material for the periods presented 

we maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to 284 million  of which 263 million  had been issued as of june 30 2014  primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for valueadded tax “vat” and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in europe and asia 

 47 

we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecasted timehorizon can vary among different suppliers our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately 2143 million  as of june 30 2014  and are primarily due within the next 12 months actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 

we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable nonstandard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hours per week coverage for 12 months see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

working capital increased to 37 billion  as of june 30 2014  compared to 35 billion  as of june 30 2013  this increase is primarily due to higher levels of cash and marketable securities as we generated significant cash flow from operations during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  as well as a higher level of inventory that resulted from supporting elevated levels of business activity as of june 30 2014  our principal source of liquidity consisted of 32 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global and regional economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months 

our credit ratings and outlooks as of june 30 2014  are summarized below   



factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under our foreign currency risk management strategy we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates this financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months see note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description our outstanding hedge contracts with maximum maturity of 18 months were as follows   



indemnification obligations subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us these obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws applicable contracts and delaware and california law the obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters for example we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors officers and employees although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited we believe the fair value of this liability to the extent estimable is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings 

we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters typically these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from or provide customers with other remedies to protect against bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products noncompliance with our product performance specifications infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights used in our products and a breach of warranties representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold validity of certain intellectual property rights noninfringement of thirdparty rights and certain income taxrelated matters in each of these circumstances payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract this usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants to control the defense or settlement of any thirdparty claims brought against the other party further our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts activity typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party and duration in some instances we may have recourse against third parties andor insurance covering certain payments made by us 

in addition we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customerspecific pricing discount rebate or credit commitments offered by us furthermore we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection to date we have made no accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future one significant customer recently exercised its audit rights but we cannot predict the outcome of that audit at this time 

it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of june 30 2014  actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2014  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 27 billion these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 from levels as of june 30 2014  the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by 14 million 

in april 2008 we issued 750 million  aggregate principal amount of 690  senior unsecured longterm debt due in 2018 the fair market value of longterm fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of june 30 2014  the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were 7479 million  and 8937 million  respectively as of june 30 2013  the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were 7474 million  and 8723 million  respectively 

see note 4 “marketable securities” to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 and risk factors in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of june 30 2014  

as of june 30 2014  we had net forward and option contracts to sell 254 million  in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures see note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2014  the us dollar equivalent would have been 256 million a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 175 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows

controls and procedures 

tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” “disclosure controls” as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k this “report” required by exchange act rules 13a15b or 15d15b the controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” based on this evaluation the ceo and cfo have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report the company’s disclosure controls were effective at a reasonable assurance level 

attached as exhibits to this report are certifications of the ceo and cfo which are required in accordance with rule 13a14 of the exchange act this controls and procedures section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented 

definition of disclosure controls 

disclosure controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports filed under the exchange act such as this report is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure the company’s disclosure controls include components of its internal control over financial reporting which consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states to the extent that components of the company’s internal control over financial reporting are included within its disclosure controls they are included in the scope of the company’s annual controls evaluation 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the ceo and cfo the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in internal control—integrated framework 1992  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation the company’s management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2014  

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2014  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

 91 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

industry 

general background 

the semiconductor industry is klatencor’s core focus the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is typically 150 millimeters 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters usually referred to as “6 inch” “8 inch” or “12 inch” wafers respectively in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish other more specialized wafers such as epitaxial silicon “epi” and silicononinsulator “soi” are also common in the semiconductor industry 

 1 

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper “interconnect” structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when all of the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality the wafer is then cut into individual devices and those chips that passed functional testing are packaged final testing is performed on all packaged chips 

current trends 

the rapid growth of consumer demand for mobile devices including smartphones tablets and portable pcs is currently driving the electronics industry and as a result the semiconductor industry as well contained within each of these latest consumer devices are advanced semiconductors that are helping enable the features consumers want in device performance such as battery management and speed at a lower cost alongside this market growth the industry continues to witness a high rate of change in technology with the emergence of new techniques and architectures in production today such as threedimensional  “ 3d ”  transistors advanced patterning lithography and semiconductors with critical dimensions at 28 nanometer and below klatencors inspection and measurement technologies play a key role in enabling the success of our customers advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to highvolume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trends such as a specific design rule shrink in today’s market driven by consumer demand for lowcost electronic goods the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies some requiring new substrate and film materials new geometries and advanced lithography techniques 

while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected their adoption into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects while device performance characteristics namely speed capacity or power management become more sensitive to parameters such as linewidth and film thickness variation new process materials such as highk dielectrics soi wafers and immersion lithographycapable photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 5 billion substantially more than previousgeneration facilities in addition chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment 

by developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment “roi” once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume our tools help ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution in addition the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules coupled with new materials and device innovation has increased inprocess variability which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling 

 2 

klatencor systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer reticle and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems the ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes this helps them increase their yield of highperformance parts and deliver their products to market faster—thus maximizing their profit with our broad portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ nextgeneration products helping our customers respond to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes the transition from 300 millimeter to 450 millimeter wafers and new backend packaging techniques

customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout asia the united states and europe staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers in each of these regions 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2013  2012  and 2011  the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues 

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are aimed at building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services our customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility that are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier for multiple products and services our revenues are derived primarily from product sales mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in asia the united states and europe we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2013  we employed approximately 2310 sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of whollyowned subsidiaries or branches in other countries including belgium china france germany hong kong india israel italy japan singapore south korea taiwan and the united kingdom international revenues accounted for approximately 70  79  and 81  of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended june 30 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 16 “segment reporting and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

 10 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in nonus dollar product sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in item 1a “risk factors” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our shipment backlog for systems and associated warranty totaled 817 million and 947 million as of june 30 2013  and 2012  respectively and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received and the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months orders for service contracts and unreleased products are excluded from shipment backlog all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer often with limited or no penalties we make adjustments for shipment backlog obtained from acquired companies sales order cancellations customer delivery date changes and currency adjustments shipment backlog is not subject to normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our basic financial statements in addition the concept of shipment backlog is not defined in the accounting literature making comparisons between periods and with other companies difficult and potentially misleading 

our revenue backlog which includes sales orders where physical deliveries have been completed but for which revenue has not been recognized pursuant to our policy for revenue recognition totaled 271 million and 286 million as of june 30 2013  and 2012  respectively orders for service contracts are excluded from revenue backlog 

because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between on the one hand our ability to manufacture deliver and install products and on the other the requirements of our customers in our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources management of our operating model and other factors we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries and installations of products which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products 

research and development 

the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs in addition we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby certain government agencies or other third parties fund a portion of our research and development costs as of june 30 2013  we employed approximately 1395 research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  involved the development of process control and yield management equipment aimed at addressing the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes the transition from 300 millimeter to 450 millimeter wafers and new backend packaging techniques for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

 11 

the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product research and development even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to enhance our competitive position new product introductions however may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products and if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in the united states milpitas california singapore israel belgium germany and china as of june 30 2013  we employed approximately 980 manufacturing personnel 

some critical parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications while other parts are standard commercial products we use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers through our business interruption planning we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by among other things monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources or disruptions within our suppliers oftencomplex supply chains could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have such as applied materials inc asml holding nv and hitachi hightechnologies corporation we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability installed base and technical service and support as well as overall cost of ownership 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions and alliances 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

 12 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment including without limitation the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial condition results of operations or competitive position 

however any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of june 30 2013  we employed approximately 5820 people none of our employees are represented by a labor union however our employees in the german operations of our mie business unit are represented by an employee work council we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees

risk factors 

tableend 

a description of factors that could materially affect our business financial condition or operating results is provided below 

risks associated with our industry 

the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict the cyclical nature of the primary industry in which we operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization consumer demand for products inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital this cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in or cancellation or delay of orders which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customers funding status which could be weakened not only by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or companyspecific reasons but also by funding limitations imposed by the customers unique corporate structure any of these factors could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues as was experienced during fiscal year 2009 we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results then our business could be seriously harmed furthermore any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

in addition our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics which when made are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time however largely due to the cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles our actual results may vary and have varied in the past from forecasted results these variations can occur for any number of reasons including but not limited to unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders product shipments or product acceptances an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to adapt to changing business conditions or a different than anticipated effective tax rate the impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment this is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues but also due to the advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order in order to meet the expected lead times to significant inventory writeoffs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided we provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of managements expectations for the future but parties reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of and are themselves forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this item 1a and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements if our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts or if we revise our forecasts the market price of our common stock could decline 

 16 

ongoing changes in the technology industry as well as the semiconductor industry in particular could expose our business to significant risks 

the semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve pricing trends in the endmarkets for consumer electronics and other products which place a growing emphasis on our customers cost of ownership changes in our customers capital spending patterns and in general an environment of constant change and development including decreasing product and component dimensions use of new materials and increasingly complex device structures applications and process steps if we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends or with respect to technological advances if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry as the significant majority of our sales are made to semiconductor manufacturers some of the trends that our management monitors in operating our business include the following 

 any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers’ rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce which could result in downward pressure on our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been and is becoming increasingly highly concentrated in this environment orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales this increasing concentration exposes our business financial condition and operating results to a number of risks including the following 

  17 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions for example the size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink and the industry is currently transitioning to the use of new materials and innovative fab processes while we expect these trends will increase our customers’ reliance on diagnostic products such as ours we cannot be sure that these trends will directly improve our business these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards to develop and introduce new products that successfully address changing customer needs to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner 

in this environment we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance features and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

in addition the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks we regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer even before receiving the customers formal acceptance of that product in certain situations including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted however our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents all of which must perform to their respective specifications so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall products required specifications in such a situation the customer may be entitled to certain remedies which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and as a result our stock price 

 18 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business in addition we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects the termination of any such collaboration or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration could significantly impair our research and development efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of continuing significant investments in product research and development however we may enter new markets whether through acquisitions or new internal product development in which competition is based primarily on product pricing not technological superiority further some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition

our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing through our business interruption planning we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by among other things monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers also key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers’ proprietary intellectual property in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for highperformance hightechnology components which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products in addition if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations which is a heightened risk during economic downturns that would affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products similarly especially with respect to suppliers of hightechnology components our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in a timely manner and result in delays for our products our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms furthermore a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons including the suppliers financial condition or business operational decisions which would require us to purchase in a single transaction a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers such “endoflife” parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory writeoff in a future period either of which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods 

if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan our operating results business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted 

we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually revised frequently generally quarterly and reviewed by management even more frequently at least monthly our business plan is developed based on a number of factors many of which require estimates and assumptions such as our expectations of the economic environment future business levels our customers’ willingness and ability to place orders leadtimes and future revenue and cash flow our budgeted operating expenses for example are based in part on our future revenue expectations however our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors including the volatile and cyclical nature of our primary industry customer order cancellations macroeconomic changes operational matters regarding particular agreements our ability to manage customer deliveries and resources for the installation and acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to manage delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a 

because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results similarly if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period which would also negatively affect our results of operations if we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted such an outcome could cause customers suppliers or investors to view us as less stable or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

in addition our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources the need to manage our operating model and other factors in furtherance of those efforts we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries installations and payment scheduling any such decisions may impact our ability to recognize revenue including the fiscal period during which such revenue may be recognized with respect to such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or stock price 

 20 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors first instituted a quarterly dividend during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 since that time we have announced several increases in the amount of our quarterly dividend level we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends may be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws and changes to our business model our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

there are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness 

as of june 30 2013  we had 750 million  aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness represented by our senior notes that will mature in 2018 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and the other risk factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities factors that can affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of our senior notes we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of the senior notes our ability to repurchase the senior notes in such event may be limited by law by the indenture associated with the senior notes or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time if we fail to repurchase the senior notes as required by the indenture it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations 

we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions including our indemnification of third parties as well as the performance of our products 

although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties costly and timeconsuming litigation or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes or could impact our revenue or cost recognition any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in our commercial agreements from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and lessors with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes in addition notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations whether or not asserted due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

 21 

we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects especially when products are first introduced unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us including increased service or warranty costs providing product replacements for or modifications to defective products litigation related to defective products product recalls or product writeoffs or disposal costs these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business financial condition and operating results in addition our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

furthermore we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives such as credits toward future purchases we believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our longterm business as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase higher volumes of our products however these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives as a result these volume purchase arrangements while expected to be beneficial to our business over time could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in nearterm periods including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and therefore our gross margins 

there are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development 

we are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies both domestically and internationally governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future in addition under the terms of these government grants the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur directly and indirectly in connection with such programs any such audit could result in modifications to or even termination of the applicable government funding program for example if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program those costs would not be reimbursed and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded we do not know the outcome of any future audits any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties financial or otherwise termination of funding programs suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency any of which could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our business 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we recorded material restructuring charges of 387 million related to our global workforce reduction large excess inventory writeoffs of 856 million and material impairment charges of 4467 million related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets if we again encounter challenging economic conditions once again we may implement additional cost reduction actions discontinue certain business operations or make other organizational changes which would require us to take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to among other things employee terminations or exit costs we may also be required to writeoff additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline also as our lead times from suppliers increase due to the increasing complexity of the parts and components they provide and the lead times demanded by our customers decrease due to the time pressures they face when introducing new products or technology or bringing new facilities into production we may be compelled to increase our commitments and therefore our risk exposure to inventory purchases to meet our customers demands in a timely manner and that inventory may need to be writtenoff if demand for the underlying product declines for any reason such additional writeoffs could constitute material charges 

as noted above we recorded a material charge during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using the straightline method and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for longlived assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and as applicable the amount of any previous impairment charge could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge 

 22 

any such additional material charges whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements 

we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements 

we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions any of which may prove not to be financially viable if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables however by entering into these arrangements and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services we are exposed to additional risks if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered 

in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws if we were to violate any such law we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general commercial operational financial and regulatory risks 

we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy 

the severe tightening of the credit markets turmoil in the financial markets and weakening of the global economy that were experienced during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 contributed to slowdowns in the industries in which we operate which slowdowns could recur or worsen if economic conditions were to deteriorate again 

the markets for semiconductors and therefore our business are ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending which caused our customers to decrease cancel or delay their equipment and service orders from us in the economic slowdown during fiscal year 2009 in addition the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell reduced demand combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of such financing has at times in the past several years adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels 

in addition a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and where applicable credit ratings and government guarantees of the underlying investments a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity if the market value of such investments were to decline or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

 23 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges including but not limited to 

 any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property or other confidential information that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information in addition we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties with respect to intellectual property infringement disputes our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition furthermore we may potentially be subject to claims by customers suppliers or other business partners or by governmental law enforcement agencies related to our receipt distribution andor use of thirdparty intellectual property or confidential information legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit and associated internal investigations with respect to intellectual property or confidential information disputes are often expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert managements attention and other company resources andor may result in restrictions on our ability to sell our products settlements on significantly adverse terms or adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines any of which could have a significant negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings claims or investigations the instigation of legal proceedings or claims our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims or the determination of any adverse findings against us or any of our employees in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our business reputation 

 24 

we are exposed to various risks related to the legal including environmental regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to compliance with new existing different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust anticorruptionantibribery unclaimed property and export control regulations our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws rules or regulations or changes to existing laws rules or regulations including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business from time to time we may receive inquiries or audit notices from governmental or regulatory bodies or we may participate in voluntary disclosure programs related to legal regulatory or tax compliance matters and these inquiries notices or programs may result in significant financial cost including investigation expenses defense costs assessments and penalties reputational harm and other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations including those that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental regulations including regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute potentially more expensive andor rarer materials further we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by any release regardless of fault we also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the materials composition of our products including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources of certain metals and other materials the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business 

in addition we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment contracts product performance product liability antitrust environmental regulations securities unfair competition and other matters in addition to proceedings and claims related to intellectual property matters which are separately discussed elsewhere in this item 1a these legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit our ability to sell our products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims which could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

new regulations related to “conflict minerals” may force us to incur additional expenses may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 

in august 2012 under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the sec adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as “conflict minerals” regardless of their actual country of origin in their products some of these metals are commonly used in electronic equipment and devices including our products these new requirements require companies to investigate disclose and report whether or not such metals originated from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries we have an extremely complex supply chain with numerous suppliers many of whom are not obligated by the new law to investigate their own supply chains for the components and parts used in each of our products as a result we may incur significant costs to comply with the diligence and disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant metals used in our products in addition because our supply chain is so complex we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origin of all the relevant metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our business reputation though we do not anticipate that our customers will need to know our conflict mineral status to satisfy their own sec reporting obligations if any we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers if they nonetheless require that we prove or certify that our products are “conflict free” key components and parts that can be shown to be “conflict free” may not be available to us in sufficient quantity or at all or may only be available at significantly higher cost to us if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier any of these outcomes could adversely impact our business financial condition or operating results 

 25 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future our business and operations could be harmed 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting functions to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations in addition many of these outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage employ “cloud computing” technology for such storage which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the users physical infrastructure but instead are delivered to and consumed by the user as an internetbased service these providers cloud computing systems may be susceptible to “cyber incidents” such as intentional cyber attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cybersecurity compromises that are outside of our control if we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as anticipated or do not adequately protect our data from cyberrelated security breaches or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes we may experience operational difficulties such as limitations on our ability to ship products increased costs manufacturing or service interruptions or delays loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data quality and compliance issues and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operation our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations 

our global operations are linked by information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications despite our implementation of network security measures our tools and servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems and tools located at customer sites or could be subject to system failures or malfunctions for other reasons system failures or malfunctioning such as difficulties with our customer relationship management “crm” system could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results our enterprise resource planning “erp” system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records record transactions provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems whether in connection with the regular operation periodic enhancements modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any such event could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders 

 26 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected in addition we may lose key employees of the acquired companies as a result risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons including 

 at times we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary highly sensitive information the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations or in the operations of our customers due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states singapore israel belgium germany and china in addition our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors as well as our other operations and those of our customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fire earthquake volcanic eruptions energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites we cannot ensure that alternate means of conducting our operations whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if such alternate means were available they could be obtained on favorable terms 

in addition as part of our costcutting actions we have consolidated several operating facilities our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above such as acts of war or terrorism earthquakes fires or other natural disasters if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at or acts of war in the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business increased international political instability in various parts of the world disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations we maintain significant manufacturing and research and development operations in israel an area that has historically experienced a high degree of political instability and we are therefore exposed to risks associated with future instability in that region such instability could directly impact our ability to operate our business or our customers ability to operate their business in the affected region cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate this same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

 27 

we self insure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain other risks are uninsurable or are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations a significant portion of which are conducted in california an area highly susceptible to earthquakes it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products much of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we self insure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also selfinsured either based on a similar costbenefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the euro and the japanese yen we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally in addition an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the united states and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected furthermore if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge we may experience material financial losses 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments impairment of our investments could harm our earnings in addition we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that have a maximum effective maturity of three years the longer the duration of these securities the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields as market interest rates and bond yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity however an impairment of the fair market value of our investments even if unrealized must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

in addition the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets our operating results or other performance metrics or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies 

we are exposed to risks in connection with tax audits in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

 28 

a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in stockbased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws for example proposals for fundamental united states international tax reform changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes a change in our effective tax rate can adversely impact our results from operations 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements is becoming increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices or changes in interpretations of such standards practices or rules can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future changes to or revised interpretations or applications of existing tax or accounting rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

for example the adoption of the authoritative guidance for stockbased compensation   which required us to measure all employee stockbased compensation awards using a fair value method beginning in fiscal year 2006 and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements has had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements which involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates judgments and assumptions are as follows 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured we derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems spare parts and services in general we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer when a customer delays installation for delivered products for which we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance under certain circumstances however we recognize revenue upon shipment prior to acceptance from the customer as follows 

 in circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation 

we enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units additionally judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

tradein rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases we estimate the value of the tradein right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale this amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the tradein right or the expiration of the tradein right 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract including consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured 

 35 

we sell standalone software that is subject to the software revenue recognition guidance we periodically review selling prices to determine whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” exists and in some situations where we are unable to establish vsoe for undelivered elements such as postcontract service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for 12  months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences 

the deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to customers in japan to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to customers in japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or market demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on forecasted usage these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

warranty  we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12  months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses utilizing actual service records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge we update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

allowance for doubtful accounts  a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to record additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

stockbased compensation  we account for stockbased awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards the fair value of stockbased awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period the fair value is determined using a blackscholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units the blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of assumptions including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the marketbased implied volatility from traded options of our common stock 

accounting for cashbased longterm incentive compensation  cashbased longterm incentive “cash lti” awards issued to employees under our cash lti program vest in four  equal installments with 25  of the aggregate amount of the cash lti award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four year period in order to receive payments under a cash lti award participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date compensation expense related to the cash lti awards is recognized over the vesting term which is adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures 

 36 

contingencies and litigation  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 12 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

goodwill and intangible assets  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable longlived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable see note 5 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit as of november 30 2012  during the three months ended december 31 2012  and concluded that there was no impairment there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the three months ended december 31 2012  the next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the three months ending december 31 2013  

if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions we may be required to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment analysis in addition if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets we may be required to record goodwill andor intangible asset impairment charges in future periods it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or if it does whether such charge would be material to our results of operations 

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed within the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

 37 

valuation of marketable securities our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration of the investment the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment default and loss rates of the underlying collateral structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

effects of recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an accounting standard update requiring an increase in the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income the amendment eliminated the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and required that total comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income be presented in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the amendment became effective for our interim period ended september 30 2012 in february 2013 the fasb issued an accounting standard update on the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income of various components which was originally deferred by the fasb in december 2011 the february 2013 update does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements however this update requires an entity to present parenthetically on the face of the financial statements in the notes or in some cases crossreferenced to related footnote disclosures significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification the amendment reflected in the february 2013 update becomes effective prospectively in the first quarter of the companys fiscal year ending june 30 2014 early adoption is permitted the amendment reflected in the february 2013 update will not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosureonly in nature 

in december 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standard update requiring enhanced disclosure about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement the disclosure requirement becomes effective retrospectively in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2014 we do not expect that the requirement will have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosureonly in nature 

in september 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standard update intended to simplify testing goodwill for impairment the amendment allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test an entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the amendment by its terms became effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for our fiscal year ended june 30 2013 and early adoption was permitted we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of the three months ended december 31 2011 see note 5 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

executive summary 

klatencor corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries our broad portfolio of defect inspection and metrology products and related service software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process from research and development to final volume production we provide leadingedge equipment software and support that enable ic manufacturers to identify resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost in addition to serving the semiconductor industry we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries including the light emitting diode “led” and data storage industries as well as general materials research 

 38 

our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer ic lithography reticle “reticle” or “mask” and disk manufacturers around the world our products services and expertise are used by our customers to measure and control nanometriclevel manufacturing processes and to detect analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment our revenues are driven largely by our customers spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets  memory foundry and logic all three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in enduser demand which influence the level and pattern of our customers spending on our products and services although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics communications data processing and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries we are subject to the cyclical capital spending that characterizes these industries the timing length intensity and volatility of the capacityoriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable in addition our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability as our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings 

however in addition to these trends of cyclicality and consolidation the semiconductor industry has also been significantly impacted by constant technological innovation the growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices has caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity these investments have included process control and yield management equipment and services and have had a significant favorable impact on our revenues over the long term 

over the past three years we experienced high levels of customer demand for our products driven by the strong growth in increasingly sophisticated mobile devices incorporating advanced ics our revenue levels in the next fiscal year will depend upon whether our customers maintain these levels of investment in process control equipment our earnings for the next fiscal year will depend not only on our revenue levels but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers technology roadmaps we cannot predict the duration and sustainability of the recent favorable business conditions we have continued to scale our production volumes and capacity to meet customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventoryrelated and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate we believe that over the long term our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications as well as to reduce cost we expect that this in turn will drive longterm increased adoption of process control equipment and services that reduce semiconductor defectivity and improve manufacturing yields reinforcing the longerterm growth drivers in our industry 

the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years   



revenue decreases from sales of both our defect inspection and metrology products for the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  reflected typical cyclicality in capacityoriented capital spending by logic and memory chip manufacturers as well as delays in the procurement of nextgeneration equipment required to facilitate the transition to extreme ultraviolet lithography 

the results for the fiscal years ended june 30 2012  and june 30 2011 reflected the favorable conditions that we encountered as our customers particularly the foundries invested heavily in process control equipment to meet the strong demand driven by the mobile device markets and continued economic growth in asia 

 39 

revenues and gross margin   



product revenues 

our business is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers with revenues impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and due to the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles in the preceding periods 

product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  as a result of a decline in overall semiconductor industry capital spending revenue decreases from sales of both our defect inspection and metrology products reflected typical cyclicality in capacityoriented capital spending by logic and memory chip manufacturers as well as delays in the procurement of nextgeneration equipment required to facilitate the transition to extreme ultraviolet lithography 

product revenues were substantially flat decreasing by 1 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  revenues from sales of our metrology products increased year over year primarily driven by the adoption of our latestgeneration products to support advanced patterning lithography and the introduction of 3d structures in leading edge designs but that increase was offset by a decrease in defect inspection product revenues due to the timing of customer purchases and lower sales of product upgrades as we transitioned to our nextgeneration platforms each of these twelvemonth periods was similarly highlighted by high volumes of shipment and installation of our products to satisfy customer demand for process control equipment particularly among foundries as our customers encountered high levels of demand for semiconductors from electronics endmarkets 

service revenues 

service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period the amount of service revenues is generally a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended june 30 2011  2012  and 2013  as a result of an increase over that time period in the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers sites 

revenues  top customers 

the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues for the indicated periods 

 40 

revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows 

a significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that trend to continue 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions 

the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage 

changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues it also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements this includes the impact of capacity utilization use of overtime and variability of cost structure changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk 

our gross margin decreased to 565  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  from 581  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  primarily due to lower revenue volume partially offset by more favorable mix of products and manufacturing efficiencies 

our gross margin percentage decreased to 581  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  from 603  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  primarily due to less favorable mix of products and services sold an increase in revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements and an increase in inventory reserves related to product transitions 

 41 

engineering research and development “rd”   



in recent years our rd expenses have generally increased over time primarily due to higher costs associated with advanced product and technology development projects we incur significant costs associated with these projects including engineering material costs headcount and other expenses as technological innovation is essential to our success during certain periods rd expenses may fluctuate relative to product development phases and project timing 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  primarily due to the stage and timing of our development projects as described in the previous paragraph rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  were impacted by an increase in engineering material and depreciation of 261 million and an increase in employeerelated expenses of 90 million as a result of additional engineering headcount and annual compensation adjustments 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 248 million as a result of annual compensation adjustments and additional engineering headcount an increase in engineering material costs of 203 million for program development related to our nextgeneration defect inspection products a decrease in external rd funding of 119 million and an increase in depreciation expense of 53 million 

rd expenses include the benefit of 124 million  69 million  and 188 million  of external funding received during the fiscal years ended june 30 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants we expect our rd expenses to increase with higher levels of business activity as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes 

selling general and administrative “sga” 

  



sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  primarily due to an increase of 57 million in support costs related to product demonstrations and evaluations of our product by customers as well as depreciation expense an increase of 36 million in travel expense due to the increasingly global nature of our customers operations and business an increase of 21 million in employeerelated compensation as a result of annual compensation adjustments and additional headcount and 31 million in goodwill impairment severance and other expenses that we recognized during the three months ended september 30 2012 in connection with our decision to exit from the solar inspection business 

sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  were slightly higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  primarily due to a decrease in bad debt recovery of 107 million an increase in expenses related to infrastructure of 58 million to support current and anticipated business activities and an increase in consulting expenses of 33 million partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses of 88 million reflecting the resolution of certain litigation matters during the three months ended march 31 2012 and a decrease in employeerelated expenses of 82 million as a result of lower variable compensation 

 42 

interest income and other net and interest expense 



interest income and other net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities gains or losses from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts impairments associated with equity investments in privatelyheld companies and interest related accruals such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations the increase in interest income and other net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  was primarily attributable to a decrease in impairment charges of 29 million  for equity investments in privatelyheld companies an increase in realized gains of marketable securities of 12 million and an increase in foreign exchange related gains of 19 million partially offset by an increase of 42 million in interest and penalty accruals related to uncertain tax positions 

the increase in interest income and other net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  was primarily attributable to a decrease in impairment charges of 69 million  for equity investments in privatelyheld companies and a decrease of 41 million in interest and penalty accruals related to uncertain tax positions 

interest expense is primarily attributable to the 750 million  aggregate principal amount of senior fixed rate notes that we issued in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

provision for income taxes 

the following table provides details of income taxes 

  



the provision for income taxes differs from the statutory us federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates the tax effects of employee stock activity tax credits and state taxes 

tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  was 214  compared to 224  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in the tax effects of employee stock activity an increase in tax credits and an increase in the domestic manufacturing benefit offset by an increase in tax reserves 

tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  was 224  compared to 284  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in state tax expense a decrease in tax reserves and an increase in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the us in jurisdictions with lower tax rates 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income the amount of our pretax income as business activities fluctuate nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income the domestic manufacturing deduction nontaxable or nondeductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies

we had cumulative windfalls in excess of shortfalls of approximately 69 million  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  we incurred 119 million and 152 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal years ended june 30 2012  and 2011  respectively due to shortfalls from employee stock activity windfall tax benefits arise when a companys tax deduction for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity a shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value shortfalls are recorded as decreases to capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes 

for the fiscal year ending june 30 2014  cumulative shortfalls from employee stock activity may exceed cumulative windfalls from employee stock activity and we may therefore report higher provision for income taxes as a result because we cannot determine all of the factors that will enter into our income tax expense computation for the fiscal year ending june 30 2014  we cannot currently estimate this impact on our tax rate for the next fiscal year 

in the normal course of business we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

liquidity and capital resources 



as of june 30 2013  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 29 billion  which is an increase of 384 million  from june 30 2012  as of june 30 2013  11 billion  of our 29 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices we currently intend to permanently reinvest 939 million of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices if however a portion of these funds were to be needed for our operations in the united states we would be required to accrue and pay us and foreign taxes of approximately 3050 of the funds repatriated the amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated we have accrued but have not paid us taxes on the remaining cash of 203 million of the 11 billion  held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices as such these funds can be returned to the us without accruing any additional us tax expense 

the total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended june 30 2013  2012  and 2011  was 266 million  234 million  and 167 million  respectively the increase in the amount of dividends paid during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  compared to the preceding fiscal years reflects the increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from 035  to 040  per share that was instituted during the three months ended september 30 2012  on july 9 2013  we announced that our board of directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from 040  to 045  per share 

the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding the decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of employee restricted stock units and in connection with stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan

we have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations 

fiscal year 2013  compared to fiscal year 2012 

net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  from 942 million  to 913 million  primarily as a result of the following key factors 

 net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  from 529 million  to 241 million  primarily as a result of a decrease in the use of cash for purchases of availableforsale and trading securities net of sales and maturities of approximately 305 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  

net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  from 364 million  to 429 million  primarily as a result of the following key factors 

 fiscal year 2012  compared to fiscal year 2011 

net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  from 823 million  to 942 million  primarily as a result of the following key factors 

 net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  from 360 million  to 529 million  primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of availableforsale and trading securities net of sales and maturities of approximately 147 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  

net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  from 300 million  to 364 million  primarily as a result of the following key factors

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june 30 2013  

  



  

 starting in fiscal year 2013 we adopted a cashbased longterm incentive program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program cashbased longterm incentive “cash lti” awards issued to employees under the cash longterm incentive plan “cash lti plan” vest in four equal installments with 25 of the aggregate amount of the cash lti award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a fouryear period in order to receive payments under the cash lti plan participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date 

we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we periodically sell certain letters of credit “lcs” without recourse received from customers in payment for goods 

the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lcs for the indicated periods 



  

 46 

factoring and lc fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in interest income and other net and were not material for the periods presented 

we maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to 255 million  of which 233 million  had been issued as of june 30 2013  primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for valueadded tax “vat” and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in europe and asia 

we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecasted timehorizon can vary among different suppliers our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately 248 million  as of june 30 2013  and are primarily due within the next 12 months actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 

we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable nonstandard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hours per week coverage for 12 months see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

working capital increased to 35 billion  as of june 30 2013  compared to 33 billion  as of june 30 2012  this increase is primarily due to higher levels of cash and marketable securities as we generated significant cash flow from operations during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  as well as higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory that resulted from supporting elevated levels of business activity which was partially offset by cash payments relating to our stock repurchases and dividend programs as of june 30 2013  our principal source of liquidity consisted of 29 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global and regional economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months 

our credit ratings and outlooks as of june 30 2013  are summarized below   



factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under our foreign currency risk management strategy we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates this financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months see note 15 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description our outstanding hedge contracts with maximum maturity of 18 months were as follows   



indemnification obligations subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us these obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws applicable contracts and delaware and california law the obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters for example we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors officers and employees although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited we believe the fair value of this liability to the extent estimable is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings 

we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters typically these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from or provide customers with other remedies to protect against bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products noncompliance with our product performance specifications infringement by our products of thirdparty intellectual property rights and a breach of warranties representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold validity of certain intellectual property rights noninfringement of thirdparty rights and certain income taxrelated matters in each of these circumstances payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract this usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants to control the defense or settlement of any thirdparty claims brought against the other party further our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts activity typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party and duration in some instances we may have recourse against third parties andor insurance covering certain payments made by us 

it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of june 30 2013  actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2013  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 19 billion  these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 from levels as of june 30 2013  the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by 18 million 

as of june 30 2013  we had net forward and option contracts to sell 193 million  in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures see note 15 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2013  the us dollar equivalent would have been 174 million a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 183 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows 

in april 2008 we issued 750 million  aggregate principal amount of 690  senior unsecured longterm debt due in 2018 the fair market value of longterm fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of june 30 2013  the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were 7474 million  and 8723 million  respectively as of june 30 2012  the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were 7468 million  and 9022 million  respectively

tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” “disclosure controls” as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k this “report” required by exchange act rules 13a15b or 15d15b the controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” based on this evaluation the ceo and cfo have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report the company’s disclosure controls were effective at a reasonable assurance level 

attached as exhibits to this report are certifications of the ceo and cfo which are required in accordance with rule 13a14 of the exchange act this controls and procedures section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented 

definition of disclosure controls 

disclosure controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports filed under the exchange act such as this report is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure the company’s disclosure controls include components of its internal control over financial reporting which consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states to the extent that components of the company’s internal control over financial reporting are included within its disclosure controls they are included in the scope of the company’s annual controls evaluation 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the ceo and cfo the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in internal control—integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation the company’s management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2013  

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2013  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

 91 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

industry 

general background 

the semiconductor industry is klatencor’s core focus the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is six eight or twelve inches in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish other more specialized wafers such as epitaxial silicon “epi” and silicononinsulator “soi” are also becoming common in the semiconductor industry 

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper “interconnect” 

structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when all of the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality the wafer is then cut into individual devices and those chips that passed functional testing are packaged final testing is performed on all packaged chips 

current trends 

the rapid growth of consumer demand for mobile devices including smartphones tablets and portable pcs is currently driving the electronics industry and as a result the semiconductor industry as well contained within each of these latest consumer devices are advanced semiconductors that are helping enable the features consumers want in device performance such as battery management and speed at a lower cost alongside this market growth the industry continues to witness a high rate of change in technology with the emergence of new techniques and architectures such as threedimensional  “ 3d ”  transistors advanced patterning lithography and semiconductors with critical dimensions at 28 nanometer and below in production today klatencors inspection and measurement technologies play a key role in enabling the success of our customers advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to highvolume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trends such as a specific design rule shrink in today’s market driven by consumer demand for lowcost electronic goods the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies some requiring new substrate and film materials new geometries and advanced lithography techniques 

while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected their adoption into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects while device performance characteristics namely speed capacity or power management become more sensitive to parameters such as linewidth and film thickness variation new process materials such as highk dielectrics soi wafers and immersion lithographycapable photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 5 billion substantially more than previous generation facilities in addition chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment 

by developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment “roi” once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume our tools help ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution in addition the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules coupled with new materials and device innovation has increased inprocess variability which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling 

klatencor systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer reticle and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems the ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes this helps them increase their yield of highperformance parts and deliver their products to market ahead of their competitors—thus maximizing their profit with our broad portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ nextgeneration products helping our customers respond to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes the transition from 300 millimeter to 450 millimeter wafers and new backend packaging techniques

product table 

the following table presents a representative list of the products that we offered during the course of the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  

  



customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout asia the united states and europe staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers in each of these regions 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2012  2011  and 2010  the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues 



our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are aimed at building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services our customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility that are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier for multiple products and services our revenues are derived primarily from product sales mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in asia the united states and europe we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2012  we employed approximately 2240 sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of whollyowned subsidiaries or branches in other countries including belgium china france germany hong kong india israel italy japan singapore south korea taiwan and the united kingdom international revenues accounted for approximately 79  of our total revenues in the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  and approximately 81  of our total revenues for each of the fiscal years ended june 30 2011  and 2010  additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 16 “segment reporting and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country the revenues from our international business may also be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in nonus dollar product sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in item 1a “risk factors” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our shipment backlog for systems and associated warranty totaled 947 million and 988 million as of june 30 2012  and 2011  respectively and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received and the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months orders for service contracts and unreleased products are excluded from shipment backlog all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer often with limited or no penalties we make adjustments for shipment backlog obtained from acquired companies sales order cancellations customer delivery date changes and currency adjustments shipment backlog is not subject to normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our basic financial statements in addition the concept of shipment backlog is not defined in the accounting literature making comparisons between periods and with other companies difficult and potentially misleading 

our revenue backlog which includes sales orders where physical deliveries have been completed but for which revenue has not been recognized pursuant to our policy for revenue recognition totaled 286 million and 382 million as of june 30 2012  and 2011  respectively orders for service contracts are excluded from revenue backlog 

because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between on the one hand our ability to manufacture deliver and install products and on the other the requirements of our customers in our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources management of our operating model and other factors we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries and installations of products which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products 

research and development 

the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs in addition we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby certain government agencies or other third parties fund a portion of our research and development costs as of june 30 2012  we employed approximately 1310 research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  involved the development of process control and yield management equipment aimed at addressing the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes the transition from 300 millimeter to 450 millimeter wafers and new backend packaging techniques for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product research and development even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to enhance our competitive position new product introductions however may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products and if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in the united states milpitas california singapore israel belgium germany and china as of june 30 2012  we employed approximately 990 manufacturing personnel 

some critical parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications while other parts are standard commercial products we use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers through our business interruption planning we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by among other things monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources or disruptions within our suppliers oftencomplex supply chains could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have such as applied materials inc and hitachi electronics engineering co ltd we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability installed base and technical service and support as well as overall cost of ownership 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions and alliances 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment including without limitation the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial condition results of operations or competitive position 

however any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of june 30 2012  we employed approximately 5710 people none of our employees are represented by a labor union however our employees in the german operations of our mie business unit are represented by an employee work council we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees

risk factors 

tableend 

a description of factors that could materially affect our business financial condition or operating results is provided below 

risks associated with our industry 

the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict the cyclical nature of the primary industry in which we operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization consumer demand for products inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital this cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in or cancellation or delay of orders which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customers funding status which could be weakened not only by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or companyspecific reasons but also by funding limitations imposed by the customers unique corporate structure any of these factors could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues as was experienced during fiscal year 2009 we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results then our business could be seriously harmed furthermore any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

in addition our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics which when made are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time however largely due to the cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles our actual results may vary and have varied in the past from forecasted results these variations can occur for any number of reasons including but not limited to unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders product shipments or product acceptances an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to adapt to changing business conditions or a different than anticipated effective tax rate the impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment this is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues but also due to the advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order in order to meet the expected lead times to significant inventory writeoffs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided we provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of managements expectations for the future but parties reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of and are themselves forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this item 1a and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements if our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts or if we revise our forecasts the market price of our common stock could decline 

ongoing changes in the technology industry as well as the semiconductor industry in particular could expose our business to significant risks 

the semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve pricing trends in the endmarkets for consumer electronics and other products which place a growing emphasis on our customers cost of ownership changes in our customers capital spending patterns and in general an environment of constant change and development including decreasing product and component dimensions use of new materials and increasingly complex device structures applications and process steps if we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends or with respect to technological advances if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry as the significant majority of our sales are made to semiconductor manufacturers some of the trends that our management monitors in operating our business include the following 

 any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers’ rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce which could result in downward pressure on our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been and is becoming increasingly highly concentrated in this environment orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales this increasing concentration exposes our business financial condition and operating results to a number of risks including the following 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions for example the size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink and the industry is currently transitioning to the use of new materials and innovative fab processes while we expect these trends will increase our customers’ reliance on diagnostic products such as ours we cannot be sure that these trends will directly improve our business these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards to develop and introduce new products that successfully address changing customer needs to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner 

in this environment we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance features and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

in addition the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks we regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer even before receiving the customers formal acceptance of that product in certain situations including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted however our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents all of which must perform to their respective specifications so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall products required specifications in such a situation the customer may be entitled to certain remedies which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and as a result our stock price 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business in addition we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects the termination of any such collaboration or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration could significantly impair our research and development efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of continuing significant investments in product research and development however we may enter new markets whether through acquisitions or new internal product development in which competition is based primarily on product pricing not technological superiority further some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing through our business interruption planning we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by among other things monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers also key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers’ proprietary intellectual property in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for highperformance hightechnology components which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products in addition if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations which is a heightened risk during economic downturns that would affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products similarly especially with respect to suppliers of hightechnology components our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in a timely manner and result in delays for our products our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms furthermore a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons including the suppliers financial condition or business operational decisions which would require us to purchase in a single transaction a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers such “endoflife” parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory writeoff in a future period either of which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods 

if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan our operating results business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted 

we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually revised frequently generally quarterly and reviewed by management even more frequently at least monthly our business plan is developed based on a number of factors many of which require estimates and assumptions such as our expectations of the economic environment future business levels our customers’ willingness and ability to place orders leadtimes and future revenue and cash flow our budgeted operating expenses for example are based in part on our future revenue expectations however our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors including the volatile and cyclical nature of our primary industry customer order cancellations macroeconomic changes operational matters regarding particular agreements our ability to manage customer deliveries and resources for the installation and acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to manage delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a 

because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results similarly if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period which would also negatively affect our results of operations if we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted such an outcome could cause customers suppliers or investors to view us as less stable or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

in addition our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources the need to manage our operating model and other factors in furtherance of those efforts we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries installations and payment scheduling any such decisions may impact our ability to recognize revenue including the fiscal period during which such revenue may be recognized with respect to such products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or stock price 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors first instituted a quarterly dividend during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 since that time we have announced several increases in the amount of our quarterly dividend level we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends may be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws and changes to our business model our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

there are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness 

as of june 30 2012  we had 750 million  aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness represented by our senior notes that will mature in 2018 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and the other risk factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities factors that can affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of our senior notes we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of the senior notes our ability to repurchase the senior notes in such event may be limited by law by the indenture associated with the senior notes or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time if we fail to repurchase the senior notes as required by the indenture it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations 

we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions including our indemnification of third parties as well as the performance of our products 

although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties costly and timeconsuming litigation or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes or could impact our revenue or cost recognition any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in our commercial agreements from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and lessors with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes in addition notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations whether or not asserted due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects especially when products are first introduced unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us including increased service or warranty costs providing product replacements for or modifications to defective products litigation related to defective products product recalls or product writeoffs or disposal costs these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business financial condition and operating results in addition our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

furthermore we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives such as credits toward future purchases we believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our longterm business as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase higher volumes of our products however these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives as a result these volume purchase arrangements while expected to be beneficial to our business over time could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in nearterm periods including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and therefore our gross margins 

there are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development 

we are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies both domestically and internationally governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future in addition under the terms of these government grants the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur directly and indirectly in connection with such programs any such audit could result in modifications to or even termination of the applicable government funding program for example if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program those costs would not be reimbursed and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded we do not know the outcome of any future audits any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties financial or otherwise termination of funding programs suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency any of which could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our business 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we recorded material restructuring charges of 387 million related to our global workforce reduction large excess inventory writeoffs of 856 million and material impairment charges of 4467 million related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions once again we may implement additional cost reduction actions which would require us to take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to among other things employee terminations or exit costs we may also be required to writeoff additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline and such additional writeoffs could constitute material charges 

as noted above we recorded a material charge during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using the straightline method and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for longlived assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and as applicable the amount of any previous impairment charge could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge 

any such additional material charges whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements 

we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements 

we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions any of which may prove not to be financially viable if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables however by entering into these arrangements and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services we are exposed to additional risks if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered 

in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws if we were to violate any such law we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general commercial operational financial and regulatory risks 

we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy 

the severe tightening of the credit markets turmoil in the financial markets and weakening of the global economy that were experienced during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 contributed to slowdowns in the industries in which we operate which slowdowns could recur or worsen if economic conditions were to deteriorate again 

the markets for semiconductors and therefore our business are ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending which caused our customers to decrease cancel or delay their equipment and service orders from us in the economic slowdown during fiscal year 2009 in addition the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell reduced demand combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of such financing has at times in the past several years adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels 

in addition a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and where applicable credit ratings and government guarantees of the underlying investments a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity if the market value of such investments were to decline or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges including but not limited to 

 any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property or other confidential information that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information in addition we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties with respect to intellectual property infringement disputes our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition furthermore we may potentially be subject to claims by customers suppliers or other business partners or by governmental law enforcement agencies related to our receipt distribution andor use of thirdparty intellectual property or confidential information legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit and associated internal investigations with respect to intellectual property or confidential information disputes are often expensive to prosecute defend or conduct may divert managements attention and other company resources andor may result in restrictions on our ability to sell our products settlements on significantly adverse terms or adverse judgments for damages injunctive relief penalties and fines any of which could have a significant negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings claims or investigations the instigation of legal proceedings or claims our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims or the determination of any adverse findings against us or any of our employees in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our business reputation 

we are exposed to various risks related to the legal including environmental regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to compliance with new existing different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust anticorruptionantibribery and export control regulations our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws rules or regulations or changes to existing laws rules or regulations including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business 

our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations including those that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental regulations including regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute potentially more expensive andor rarer materials further we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by any release regardless of fault we also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the materials composition of our products including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources of certain metals and other materials the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business 

in addition we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment contracts product performance product liability antitrust environmental regulations securities unfair competition and other matters in addition to proceedings and claims related to intellectual property matters which are separately discussed elsewhere in this item 1a these legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit our ability to sell our products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims which could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future our business and operations could be harmed 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting functions to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations in addition many of these outsourced service providers including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage employ “cloud computing” technology for such storage which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the users physical infrastructure but instead are delivered to and consumed by the user as an internetbased service these providers cloud computing systems may be susceptible to “cyber incidents” such as intentional cyber attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cybersecurity compromises that are outside of our control if we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as anticipated or do not adequately protect our data from cyberrelated security breaches or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes we may experience operational difficulties such as limitations on our ability to ship products increased costs manufacturing or service interruptions or delays loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data quality and compliance issues and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operation our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations 

our global operations are linked by information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications despite our implementation of network security measures our tools and servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems and tools located at customer sites or could be subject to system failures or malfunctions for other reasons system failures or malfunctioning such as difficulties with our customer relationship management “crm” system could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results our enterprise resource planning “erp” system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records record transactions provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems whether in connection with the regular operation periodic enhancements modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any such event could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected in addition we may lose key employees of the acquired companies as a result risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons including 

 at times we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary highly sensitive information the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations or in the operations of our customers due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states singapore israel belgium and germany in addition our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors as well as our other operations and those of our customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fire earthquake volcanic eruptions energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites we cannot ensure that alternate means of conducting our operations whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if such alternate means were available they could be obtained on favorable terms 

for example the earthquakes tsunamis and related damage in japan in 2011 have affected the operations of some of our customers and suppliers in that region and may also have impacted the operations of some of our customers other suppliers which could impact our customers desire to proceed with broadbased facility upgrades and related equipment purchases or some of our suppliers suppliers which could impact our suppliers ability to deliver their products to us in a timely manner in the coming quarters these operational impacts as they continue to ripple through the japanese economy could result in delays in orders and deliveries and the other effects described earlier in this paragraph any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition as part of our costcutting actions we have consolidated several operating facilities our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above such as acts of war or terrorism earthquakes fires or other natural disasters if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at or acts of war in the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business increased international political instability in various parts of the world disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations we maintain significant manufacturing and research and development operations in israel an area that has historically experienced a high degree of political instability and we are therefore exposed to risks associated with future instability in that region such instability could directly impact our ability to operate our business or our customers ability to operate their business in the affected region cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate this same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we self insure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain other risks are uninsurable or are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations a significant portion of which are conducted in california an area highly susceptible to earthquakes it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products much of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we self insure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also selfinsured either based on a similar costbenefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the euro and the japanese yen we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally in addition an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the united states and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected furthermore if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge we may experience material financial losses 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments impairment of our investments could harm our earnings in addition we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that have a maximum effective maturity of three years the longer the duration of these securities the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields as market interest rates and bond yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity however an impairment of the fair market value of our investments even if unrealized must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

in addition the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets our operating results or other performance metrics or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies 

we are exposed to risks in connection with tax audits in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in stockbased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws for example proposals for fundamental united states international tax reform changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes a change in our effective tax rate can adversely impact our results from operations 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements is becoming increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices or changes in interpretations of such standards practices or rules can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future changes to or revised interpretations or applications of existing tax or accounting rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

for example the adoption of the authoritative guidance for stockbased compensation   which required us to measure all employee stockbased compensation awards using a fair value method beginning in fiscal year 2006 and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements has had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements which involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates judgments and assumptions are as follows 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured we derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems spare parts and services 

we recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications under certain circumstances however we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer as follows 

 we enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units additionally judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

tradein rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases we estimate the value of the tradein right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale this amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the tradein right or the expiration of the tradein right 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract including consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured 

we sell standalone software that is subject to the software revenue recognition guidance we periodically review selling prices to determine whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” exists and in some situations where we are unable to establish vsoe for undelivered elements such as postcontract service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences 

the deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to customers in japan to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to customers in japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or market demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on forecasted usage and customer support requirements these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

warranty  we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses utilizing actual service records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge we update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

allowance for doubtful accounts  a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to record additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

stockbased compensation  we account for stockbased awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards the fair value of stockbased awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period the fair value is determined using a blackscholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units the blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of assumptions including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the marketbased implied volatility from traded options of our common stock 

contingencies and litigation  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 12 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

goodwill and intangible assets  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable longlived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable see note 5 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination we performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit as of november 30 2011 during the three months ended december 31 2011  and concluded that there was no impairment there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the three months ended december 31 2011  the next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the three months ending december 31 2012  

if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions we may be required to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment analysis in addition if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets we may be required to record goodwill andor intangible asset impairment charges in future periods whether in connection with our next annual impairment assessment in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 or prior to that if any triggering event occurs outside of the quarter during which the annual goodwill impairment assessment is performed it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or if it does whether such charge would be material to our results of operations 

income taxes  we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that a valuation allowance was necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed within the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

valuation of marketable securities our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an 

impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration of the investment the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment default and loss rates of the underlying collateral structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

effects of recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an accounting standard update requiring enhanced disclosure about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement the disclosure requirement becomes effective retrospectively in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2014 we do not expect that the requirement will have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosureonly in nature 

in september 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standard update intended to simplify testing goodwill for impairment the amendment allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test an entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the amendment becomes effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for our fiscal year ending june 30 2013 and early adoption is permitted we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of the three months ended december 31 2011 see note 5 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

in june 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standard update requiring an increase in the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income the amendment eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requires that the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income be presented in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the amendment also required presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented which was indefinitely deferred by the fasb in december 2011 the amendment other than the portion regarding the presentation of reclassification adjustments which as noted above has been deferred indefinitely becomes effective during the first quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2013 early adoption is permitted the amendment will impact the presentation of the financial statements but will not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standard update providing guidance on achieving a consistent definition of and common requirements for measurement of fair value between us gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrs” this amendment was effective prospectively for our interim reporting period ended march 31 2012 early application is not permitted the amendment did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in april 2010 the fasb amended its guidance on sharebased payment awards denominated in certain currencies the amendment clarifies that an employee sharebased payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity’s equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market performance or service condition therefore an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity this amendment was effective for our interim reporting period ended september 30 2011 the amendment did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in january 2010 the fasb issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements this guidance now requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the reasons for these transfers this authoritative guidance also requires enhanced disclosure of activity in level 3 fair value measurements the guidance for level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements was effective for our interim reporting period ended march 31 2010 the implementation did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosureonly in nature the guidance for level 3 fair value measurements disclosures was effective for our interim reporting period ended september 30 2011 and the implementation of that guidance did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosureonly in nature 

executive summary 

klatencor corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries our broad portfolio of products and services primarily supports integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process from research and development to final volume production we provide leadingedge equipment software and support that enable ic manufacturers to identify resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost in addition to serving the semiconductor industry we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries including the light emitting diode “led” data storage and photovoltaic industries as well as general materials research 

our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer ic lithography reticle “reticle” or “mask” and disk manufacturers in the world our products services and expertise are used by our customers to measure and control nanometriclevel manufacturing processes and to detect analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment our revenues are driven largely by our customers spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets  memory foundry and logic all three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in enduser demand which influence the level and pattern of our customers spending on our products and services although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics communications data processing and industrial and automotive products has resulted in favorable longterm revenue growth rates for our process control and yield management solutions 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries we are subject to the cyclical capital spending that characterizes these industries the timing length intensity and volatility of capacityoriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable in addition our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability 

the growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices has caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity these investments have included process control and yield management equipment and services and have had a significant favorable impact on our revenues 

during the fiscal years ended june 30 2012 and 2011 our revenues and earnings remained robust compared to the prior several fiscal years as we responded to meet the high level of customer demand for our products driven by the strong growth in the consumer mobile device markets our revenue levels in the next fiscal year will depend upon whether our customers maintain these elevated levels of investment in process control equipment in addition to our revenue levels our earnings for the next fiscal year will also depend on the amount of research and development spending that we embark upon in meeting our customers technology roadmaps we cannot predict the duration and sustainability of these favorable business conditions we have increased our production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventoryrelated and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate we believe that over the long term our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications as well as to reduce cost we expect that this in turn will drive longterm increased adoption of process control equipment and services that reduce semiconductor defectivity and improve manufacturing yields reinforcing the longerterm growth drivers in our industry 

the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years   



the results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2012 reflected favorable conditions we encountered as our customers particularly the foundries invested heavily in process control equipment to meet the strong demand driven by the mobile device markets 

the results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 reflected improved fundamentals in the semiconductor industry as compared to the prior fiscal year driven by reduced uncertainty over the global economic environment and continued economic growth in much of asia as we increased our business activity levels and shipped more products to our customers during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 we continued to maintain cost discipline which resulted in improved gross margins as well as net income 

revenues and gross margin   



product revenues 

product revenues were substantially flat decreasing by 1 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  revenues from sales of our metrology products increased year over year primarily driven by the adoption of our latest generation products to support advanced patterning lithography and the introduction of 3d structures in leading edge designs but that increase was offset by a decrease in defect inspection product revenues due to the timing of customer purchases and reduction in the sale of product upgrades as we transitioned to our nextgeneration platforms each of these twelvemonth periods was similarly highlighted by increased volumes of shipment and installation of our products to satisfy customer demand for process control equipment particularly among foundries as our customers encountered high levels of demand for semiconductors from electronics endmarkets 

product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  primarily as a result of increased shipment and acceptance of our products within the year many of our customers continued to maintain high levels of capital spending for advanced technology development as well as capacity related investments resulting in an increase in the number of tools that we sold and revenues that we recognized across each of the three major semiconductor markets memory foundry and logic compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 an increase in the sales of both our defect inspection and metrology equipment contributed to the increase in the number of tools that we sold during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 

service revenues 

service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period the amount of service revenues is generally a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems service revenues increased during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  compared to the fiscal years ended june 30 2011  and 2010  as a result of an increase in the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers sites as well as service work completed in the three months ended september 30 2011 to assist our customers in japan as their operations recovered from the effects of the 2011 tohoku earthquake and tsunami 

the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues for the indicated periods 



revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows 

a significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that trend to continue 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions over the past several years we have embarked on various advanced product development customer satisfaction improvement and globalization initiatives to improve our competitiveness and gross margins over the past eight quarters our gross margin has generally benefited from the operating efficiencies associated with elevated levels of revenues over that period 

the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage 

changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues it also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements this includes the impact of capacity utilization use of overtime and variability of cost structure changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk 

our gross margin decreased to 581  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  from 603  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  primarily due to less favorable mix of products and services sold an increase in revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements and an increase in inventory reserves related to product transitions 

our gross margin percentage increased to 603  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  from 552  during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  primarily due to increased demand and revenue from the sale of advanced technology defect inspection and metrology products 

engineering research and development “rd”   



rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 248 million as a result of annual compensation adjustments and additional engineering headcount an increase in engineering material costs of 203 million for program development related to our nextgeneration defect inspection products a decrease in external rd funding of 119 million and an increase in depreciation expense of 53 million 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  primarily due to an increase in employeerelated expenses of 278 million as a result of additional engineering headcount and higher variable compensation an increase in engineering material costs of 242 million for program development related to our nextgeneration defect inspection products and an increase in external services of 97 million to support expanded rd activities partially offset by an increase of 51 million in benefit to rd expense from external funding 

rd expenses include the benefit of 69 million  188 million  and 137 million  of external funding received during the fiscal years ended june 30 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants we expect our rd expenses to increase with higher levels of business activity as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes 

selling general and administrative “sga” 

  



sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  primarily due to a decrease in bad debt recovery of 107 million an increase in expenses related to infrastructure of 58 million to support current and anticipated business activities and an increase in consulting expenses of 33 million partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses of 88 million reflecting the resolution of certain litigation matters during the three months ended march 31 2012 and a decrease in employeerelated expenses of 82 million as a result of lower variable compensation 

sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  primarily due to increases in employeerelated expenses of 370 million as a result of additional headcount to support higher sales volume and higher variable compensation partially offset by a decrease in asset impairment charges of 134 million a decrease in legal expenses of 91 million related to our historical stock option practices and certain indemnification obligations and an increase in bad debt recovery of 67 million 

interest income and other net and interest expense 



interest income and other net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities gains or losses from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts impairments associated with equity investments in privatelyheld companies and interest related accruals such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations the increase in interest income and other net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  was primarily attributable to a decrease in impairment charges of 69 million  for equity investments in privatelyheld companies and a decrease of 41 million in interest and penalty accruals related to uncertain tax positions 

the decrease in interest income and other net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  was primarily attributable to an increase in impairment charges of 68 million for equity investments in privatelyheld companies and an international tax reserve benefit of 159 million  due to the expiration of a statute of limitations relating to an uncertainty in our position with respect to a foreign transactionbased tax during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  compared to no tax reserve benefit during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  

interest expense is primarily attributable to the 750 million  aggregate principal amount of senior fixed rate notes that we issued in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

provision for income taxes 

the following table provides details of income taxes 

  



the provision for income taxes differs from the statutory us federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates and tax credits offset by state taxes the tax effects of employee stock activity and other factors 

tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  was 224  compared to 284  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  tax expense decreased primarily from a decrease in state tax expense a decrease in tax reserves and an increase in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the us in jurisdictions with lower tax rates 

tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  was 284  compared to 271  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  tax expense increased primarily from an increase in state tax expense a decrease in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the us in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and an increase in tax reserves offset by a decrease in the effect of shortfalls from employee stock activity 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income the amount of our pretax income as business activities fluctuate nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income the domestic manufacturing deduction nontaxable or nondeductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

we incurred 119 million and 152 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal years ended june 30 2012  and 2011  respectively due to shortfalls from employee stock activity windfall tax benefits arise when a companys tax deduction for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity a shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value shortfalls are recorded as decreases to capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes 

for the fiscal year ending june 30 2013  cumulative shortfalls from employee stock activity may continue to exceed cumulative windfalls from employee stock activity and we may therefore report higher provision for income taxes as a result because we cannot determine all of the factors that will enter into our income tax expense computation for the fiscal year ending june 30 2013  we cannot currently estimate this impact on our tax rate for the next fiscal year 

in the normal course of business we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

liquidity and capital resources 



as of june 30 2012  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 25 billion  which is an increase of 496 million  from june 30 2011  as of june 30 2012  888 million of our 25 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices we currently intend to permanently reinvest approximately 673 million of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries if however a portion of these funds were to be needed for our operations in the united states we would be required to accrue and pay us and foreign taxes of approximately 3050 of the funds repatriated the amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated we have accrued but have not paid us taxes on the remaining cash of 215 million of the 888 million held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices as such these funds can be returned to the us without accruing any additional us tax expense 

the total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended june 30 2012  2011  and 2010  was 234 million  167 million  and 102 million  respectively the increase in the total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  compared to the preceding fiscal years reflected an increase during the quarter ended september 30 2011  to the level of our quarterly dividend from 025  to 035  per share on july 10 2012  we announced that our board of directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from 035  to 040  per share 

the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have decreased our basic and diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding the decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of employee restricted stock units and in connection with stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan in october 2008 we suspended our stock repurchase program and we subsequently restarted the program in february 2010 

we have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations 

fiscal year 2012  compared to fiscal year 2011 

net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  from 823 million  to 942 million  primarily as a result of the following key factors 

 net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  from 360 million  to 529 million  primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of availableforsale and trading securities net of sales and maturities of approximately 147 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  

net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  from 300 million  to 364 million  primarily as a result of the following key factors 

 fiscal year 2011  compared to fiscal year 2010 

net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  from 448 million  to 823 million  primarily as a result of the following key factors 

 net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  from 228 million  to 360 million  primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of availableforsale and trading securities net of sales and maturities of approximately 124 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  

net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  from 216 million  to 300 million  primarily as a result of the following key factors 

 contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june 30 2012  

  



  

 we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition from time to time we will discount without recourse letters of credit “lcs” received from customers in payment for goods 

the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lcs for the indicated periods 



factoring and lc fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in interest income and other net and were not material for the periods presented 

we maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to 202 million  of which 182 million  had been issued as of june 30 2012  primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for valueadded tax “vat” and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in europe and asia 

we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecasted timehorizon can vary among different suppliers our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately 308 million  as of june 30 2012  and are primarily due within the next 12 months actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 

we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates nonstandard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

working capital increased to 33 billion  as of june 30 2012  compared to 28 billion  as of june 30 2011  this increase is primarily due to higher levels of cash and marketable securities as we generated significant cash flow from operations during the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  as well as higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory that resulted from supporting elevated levels of business activities which was partially offset by cash payments relating to our stock repurchases and dividend programs as of june 30 2012  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 25 billion  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 

our credit ratings and outlooks as of july 9 2012  are summarized below   



factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under our foreign currency risk management strategy we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates this financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months see note 15 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description our outstanding hedge contracts with maximum maturity of 18 months were as follows   



indemnification obligations subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us these obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws applicable contracts and delaware and california law the obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters for example we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors officers and employees although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is theoretically unlimited we believe the fair value of this liability to the extent estimable is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings 

we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters typically these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from or provide customers with other remedies to protect against bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products noncompliance with our product performance specifications infringement by our products of thirdparty intellectual property rights and a breach of warranties representations and covenants related to such matters as title to assets sold validity of certain intellectual property rights noninfringement of thirdparty rights and certain income taxrelated matters in each of these circumstances payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract this usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants to control the defense or settlement of any thirdparty claims brought against the other party further our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts activity typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party and duration in some instances we may have recourse against third parties andor insurance covering certain payments made by us 

it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of june 30 2012  actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2012  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 18 billion  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 from levels as of june 30 2012  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by 15 million 

as of june 30 2012  we had net forward and option contracts to sell 195 million  in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in note 15 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2012  the us dollar equivalent would have been 200 million  a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 184 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows 

in april 2008 we issued 750 million  aggregate principal amount of 690  senior unsecured notes due in 2018 the fair market value of longterm fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of june 30 2012  the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were 7468 million  and 9022 million  respectively as of june 30 2011  the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were 7463 million  and 8635 million  respectively

attached as exhibits to this report are certifications of the ceo and cfo which are required in accordance with rule 13a14 of the exchange act this controls and procedures section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented 

definition of disclosure controls 

disclosure controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports filed under the exchange act such as this report is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure the company’s disclosure controls include components of its internal control over financial reporting which consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states to the extent that components of the company’s internal control over financial reporting are included within its disclosure controls they are included in the scope of the company’s annual controls evaluation 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the ceo and cfo the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in internal control—integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation the company’s management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2012  

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2012  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of 

two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

industry 

general background 

the semiconductor industry is klatencor’s core focus the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is six eight or twelve inches in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish other more specialized wafers such as epitaxial silicon “epi” and silicononinsulator “soi” are also becoming common in the semiconductor industry 

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure 

typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper “interconnect” structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when all of the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality the wafer is then cut into individual devices and those chips that passed functional testing are packaged final testing is performed on all packaged chips 

current trends 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to highvolume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trends such as a specific design rule shrink in today’s market driven by consumer demand for lowcost electronic goods from smart phones and mp3 players to laptops tablets and portable devices the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies some requiring new substrate and film materials new geometries and advanced lithography techniques 

while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected their adoption into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects while device performance characteristics namely speed capacity or power management become more sensitive to such parameters as linewidth and film thickness variation new process materials such as highk dielectrics soi wafers and immersion lithographycapable photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 5 billion substantially more than previous generation facilities in addition chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment 

by developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment “roi” once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume our tools help ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution in addition the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules coupled with new materials and device innovation has increased inprocess variability which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling 

klatencor systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer reticle and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems the ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes this helps them increase their yield of highperformance parts and deliver their products to market ahead of their competitors—thus maximizing their profit with our broad portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ nextgeneration products helping our customers respond to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes the transition from 300 millimeter to 450 millimeter wafers and new backend packaging techniques

product table 

the following table presents a representative list of the products that we offered during the course of the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  

  



customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout asia the united states and europe staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers in each of these regions 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2011  2010 and 2009  the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues 



our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are aimed at building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility that are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier our revenues are derived primarily from product sales mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in asia the united states and europe we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2011  we employed approximately 2150 sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of whollyowned subsidiaries or branches in other countries including belgium china france germany hong kong india israel italy japan singapore south korea taiwan and the united kingdom international revenues accounted for approximately 81  81 and 76 of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended june 30 2011  2010 and 2009  respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 17 “segment reporting and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country the revenues from our international business may also be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in nonus dollar product sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in item 1a “risk factors” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our shipment backlog for systems and associated warranty totaled 988 million and 992 million as of june 30 2011 and 2010  respectively and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received and the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months orders for service contracts and unreleased products are excluded from shipment backlog all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer often with limited or no penalties we make adjustments for shipment backlog obtained from acquired companies sales order cancellations customer delivery date changes 

and currency adjustments shipment backlog is not subject to normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our basic financial statements in addition the concept of shipment backlog is not defined in the accounting literature making comparisons between periods and with other companies difficult and potentially misleading 

our revenue backlog which includes sales orders where physical deliveries have been completed but for which revenue has not been recognized pursuant to our policy for revenue recognition totaled 382 million and 343 million as of june 30 2011 and 2010  respectively orders for service contracts are excluded from revenue backlog 

because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between on the one hand our ability to manufacture deliver and install products and on the other the requirements of our customers in our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources management of our operating model and other factors we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries and installations of products which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products 

research and development 

the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs in addition we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby certain government agencies or other third parties fund a portion of our research and development costs as of june 30 2011  we employed approximately 1220 research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 involved the development of process control and yield management equipment aimed at addressing the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes the transition from 300 millimeter to 450 millimeter wafers and new backend packaging techniques for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product research and development even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to enhance our competitive position new product introductions however may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products and if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in the united states milpitas california singapore israel belgium and germany as of june 30 2011  we employed approximately 970 manufacturing personnel 

some critical parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications while other parts are standard commercial products we use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers through our business interruption planning we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by among other things monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials identifying but not necessarily 

qualifying possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have such as applied materials inc and hitachi electronics engineering co ltd we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability installed base and technical service and support as well as overall cost of ownership 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions and alliances 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

environmental matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment including without limitation the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial condition results of operations or competitive position 

however any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities 

employees 

as of june 30 2011  we employed approximately 5500 people none of our employees are represented by a labor union however our employees in france pursuant to french industrial relations law and in the german operations of our mie business unit are represented by employee work councils we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees

risk factors 

tableend 

a description of factors that could materially affect our business financial condition or operating results is provided below 

risks associated with our industry 

the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict the cyclical nature of the primary industry in which we operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization consumer demand for products inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital this cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in or cancellation or delay of orders which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues as was experienced during fiscal year 2009 we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results then our business could be seriously harmed furthermore any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

in addition our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics which when made are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time however largely due to the cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles our actual results may vary and have varied in the past from forecasted results these variations can occur for any number of reasons including but not limited to unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders product shipments or product acceptances an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to changing business conditions or a different than anticipated effective tax rate the impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment this is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues but also due to the advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order in order to meet the expected lead times to significant inventory writeoffs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided we provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of managements expectations for the future but parties reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of and are themselves forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this item 1a and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements if our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts or if we revise our forecasts the market price of our common stock could decline 

ongoing changes in the technology industry as well as the semiconductor industry in particular could expose our business to significant risks 

the semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve pricing trends in the endmarkets for consumer electronics and other products which place a growing emphasis on our customers cost of ownership changes in our customers capital spending patterns and in general an environment of constant change and development including decreasing product and component dimensions use of new materials and increasingly complex device structures applications and process steps if we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends or with respect to 

technological advances if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry as the significant majority of our sales are made to semiconductor manufacturers some of the trends that our management monitors in operating our business include the following 

 any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers’ rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce which could result in downward pressure on our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been and is becoming increasingly highly concentrated in this environment orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales in addition the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year if customers do not place orders or they delay or cancel orders we may not be able to replace the business furthermore because our products are configured to customer specifications any changes delays or cancellations of orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs as a result of the consolidation within our customer base the customers that survive that consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales those surviving customers may have more aggressive policies regarding engaging alternative secondsource suppliers for the products we serve and in addition may seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us any of these changes could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins also certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes experienced management changes or have outsourced manufacturing activities any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions as a result of the challenging economic environment during fiscal year 2009 we were and in some cases continue to be exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial viability of certain of our customers to the extent our customers experience liquidity issues in the future we may be required to incur additional bad debt expense with respect to receivables owed to us by those customers in addition customers with liquidity issues may be forced to discontinue operations or may be acquired by one of our customers and in either case such event would have the effect of further consolidating our customer base any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions for example the size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink and the industry is currently transitioning to the use of new materials and innovative fab processes while we expect these trends will increase our customers’ reliance on diagnostic products such as ours we cannot be sure that these trends will directly improve our business these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards to develop and introduce new products that successfully address changing customer needs to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner 

in this environment we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance features and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

in addition the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks we regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer even before receiving the customers formal acceptance of that product in certain situations including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted however our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents all of which must perform to their respective specifications so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall products required specifications in such a situation the customer may be entitled to certain remedies which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and as a result our stock price 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business in addition we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects the termination of any such collaboration or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration could significantly impair our research and development efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain 

territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of continuing significant investments in product research and development however we may enter new markets whether through acquisitions or new internal product development in which competition is based primarily on product pricing not technological superiority further some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specifications in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing through our business interruption planning we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by among other things monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers identifying but not necessarily qualifying possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers also key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers’ proprietary intellectual property in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for highperformance hightechnology components which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products in addition if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations which is a heightened risk during economic downturns that would affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms 

if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan our operating results business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted 

we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually revised frequently generally quarterly and reviewed by management even more frequently at least monthly our business plan is developed based on a number of factors many of which require estimates and assumptions such as our expectations of the economic environment future business levels our customers’ willingness and ability to place orders leadtimes and future revenue and cash flow our budgeted operating expenses for example are based in part on our future revenue expectations however our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors including the volatile and cyclical nature of our industry customer order cancellations macroeconomic changes operational matters regarding particular agreements our ability to manage customer deliveries and resources for the installation and acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to manage delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a 

because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results similarly if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period which would also negatively affect our results of operations if we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted such an outcome could cause customers suppliers or investors to view us as less stable or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors first instituted a quarterly dividend during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 since that time we have announced several increases in the amount of our quarterly dividend level we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends may be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws and changes to our business model our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

there are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness 

as of june 30 2011  we had 750 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness represented by our senior notes that will mature in 2018 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and the other risk factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities factors that can affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of our senior notes we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of the senior notes our ability to repurchase the senior notes in such event may be limited by law by the indenture associated with the senior notes or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time if we fail to repurchase the senior notes as required by the indenture it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations 

we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions including our indemnification of third parties as well as the performance of our products 

although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties costly and timeconsuming litigation or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes or could impact our revenue or cost recognition any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in our commercial agreements from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and lessors with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes in addition notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on 

our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations whether or not asserted due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects especially when products are first introduced unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us including increased service or warranty costs providing product replacements for or modifications to defective products litigation related to defective products product recalls or product writeoffs or disposal costs these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business financial condition and operating results in addition our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

there are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development 

we are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies both domestically and internationally governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future in addition under the terms of these government grants the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur directly and indirectly in connection with such programs any such audit could result in modifications to or even termination of the applicable government funding program for example if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program those costs would not be reimbursed and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded we do not know the outcome of any future audits any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties financial or otherwise termination of funding programs suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency any of which could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our business 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we recorded material restructuring charges of 387 million related to our global workforce reduction large excess inventory writeoffs of 856 million and material impairment charges of 4467 million related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions once again we may implement additional cost reduction actions which would require us to take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to among other things employee terminations or exit costs we may also be required to write off additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline and such additional writeoffs could constitute material charges 

as noted above we recorded a material charge during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using the straightline method and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for longlived assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and as applicable the amount of any previous impairment charge could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge 

any such additional material charges whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements 

we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements 

we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions any of which may prove not to be financially viable if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables however by entering into these arrangements and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services we are exposed to additional risks if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered 

in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws if we were to violate any such law we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general commercial operational financial and regulatory risks 

we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy 

the severe tightening of the credit markets turmoil in the financial markets and weakening of the global economy that were experienced during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 contributed to slowdowns in the industries in which we operate which slowdowns could recur or worsen if economic conditions were to deteriorate again 

the markets for semiconductors and therefore our business are ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending which caused our customers to decrease cancel or delay their equipment and service orders from us in the economic slowdown during fiscal year 2009 in addition the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell reduced demand combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of such financing has at times in the past several years adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels 

in addition a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and where applicable credit ratings and government guarantees of the underlying investments a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity if the market value of such investments were to decline or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges including but not limited to 

 any of the factors above could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we might be involved in intellectual property disputes or other intellectual property infringement claims that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information in addition we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties litigation tends to be expensive and requires significant management time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of operations or business if we lose or have to settle a case on significantly adverse terms our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms or the instigation of litigation or other administrative proceedings could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to various risks related to the legal including environmental regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to compliance with new existing different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust anticorruptionantibribery and export control regulations our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws rules or regulations or changes to existing laws rules or regulations including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business 

our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations including those that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences including fines suspension of certain of our business activities limitations on our ability to sell our products obligations to remediate environmental contamination and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions in addition changes in environmental regulations including regulations 

relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute potentially more expensive andor rarer materials further we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by any release regardless of fault we also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the materials composition of our products including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources of certain metals and other materials the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to conduct our business 

in addition we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment contracts product performance product liability antitrust environmental regulations securities unfair competition and other matters in addition to proceedings and claims related to intellectual property matters which are separately discussed elsewhere in this item 1a these legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit our ability to sell our products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims which could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and ability to operate our business 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future our business and operations could be harmed 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting functions to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations if we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained if our thirdparty service providers do not perform as anticipated or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes we may experience operational difficulties such as limitations on our ability to ship products increased costs manufacturing or service interruptions or delays loss of intellectual property rights quality and compliance issues and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operation our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations 

our global operations are linked by information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications despite our implementation of network security measures our tools and servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems and tools located at customer sites or could be subject to system failures or malfunctions for other reasons system failures or malfunctioning such as difficulties with our customer relationship management “crm” system could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results our enterprise resource planning “erp” system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records record transactions provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems whether in connection with the regular operation periodic enhancements modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any such event could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected in addition we may lose key employees of the acquired companies as a result risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons including 

 at times we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary highly sensitive information the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations or in the operations of our customers due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states singapore israel belgium and germany in addition our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors as well as our other operations and those of our customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fire earthquake volcanic eruptions energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites we cannot ensure that alternate means of conducting our operations whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if such alternate means were available they could be obtained on favorable terms 

for example recent events in japan including earthquakes tsunamis and the related damage have affected the operations of some of our customers and suppliers in that region and may also have impacted the operations of some of our customers other suppliers which could impact our customers desire to proceed with broadbased facility upgrades and related equipment purchases or some of our suppliers suppliers which could impact our suppliers ability to deliver their products to us in a timely manner in the coming quarters the recent events in japan could result in delays in orders and deliveries and the other effects described earlier in this paragraph any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition as part of our costcutting actions we have consolidated several operating facilities our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above such as acts of war or terrorism earthquakes fires or other natural disasters if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at or acts of war in the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business increased international political instability in various parts of the world disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations we maintain significant manufacturing and research and development operations in israel an area that has historically experienced a high degree of political instability and we are therefore exposed to risks associated with future instability in that region such instability could directly impact our ability to operate our business or our customers ability to operate their business in the affected region cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate this same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we self insure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain other risks are uninsurable or are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations a significant portion of which are conducted in california an area highly susceptible to earthquakes it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products much of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we self insure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also selfinsured either based on a similar costbenefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the euro and the japanese yen we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally in addition an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the united states and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with various financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected furthermore if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge we may experience material financial losses 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments impairment of our investments could harm our earnings in addition we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that have a maximum effective maturity of three years the longer the duration of these securities the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields as market interest rates and bond yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity however an impairment of the fair market value of our investments even if unrealized must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 

in addition the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets our operating results or other performance metrics or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies 

we are exposed to risks in connection with tax audits in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in stockbased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws for example proposals for fundamental united states international tax reform changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes a change in our effective tax rate can adversely impact our results from operations 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements is becoming increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices or changes in interpretations of such standards practices or rules can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and will continue to occur in the future changes to or revised interpretations or applications of existing tax or accounting rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

for example the adoption of the authoritative guidance for stockbased compensation  which required us to measure all employee stockbased compensation awards using a fair value method beginning in fiscal year 2006 and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements has had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

information regarding our principal properties as of june 30 2011 is set forth below 



    

 as of june 30 2011  we owned or leased a total of approximately 19 million square feet of space worldwide including the locations listed above and office space for smaller sales and service offices in several locations throughout the world our operating leases expire at various times through july 31 2018 with renewal options at the fair market value for additional periods up to five years additional information regarding these leases is incorporated herein by reference from note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements we believe our properties are adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and that our production facilities have capacity adequate for our current needs even after giving effect to the sale of certain properties as noted above

legal proceedings 

tableend indemnification obligations 

as a result of our indemnification obligations in connection with the litigation and government inquiries related to our historical stock option practices we are currently paying defense costs to one former officer and employee facing an sec civil action to which we are not a party and we are also obligated to pay the attorneys fees and expenses incurred by former employees in connection with discovery undertaken in that case we are further incurring costs associated with retaining counsel to respond to discovery requests and otherwise representing us in that litigation although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these arrangements is theoretically unlimited we believe the fair value of this liability to the extent estimable is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings 

other legal matters 

we are named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business actions filed against us include commercial intellectual property customer and labor and employment related claims including complaints of alleged wrongful termination and potential class action lawsuits regarding alleged violations of federal and state wage and hour and other laws litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial regardless of outcome we believe the amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimated liabilities however because such matters are subject to many uncertainties the ultimate outcomes are not predictable and there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from the matters described above will not exceed the amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements or will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements which involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured we derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems spare parts and services we typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications under certain circumstances however we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer as follows 

 we enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units additionally judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

tradein rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases we estimate the value of the tradein right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale this amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the tradein right or the expiration of the tradein right 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract if maintenance is included in an arrangement that includes a software license agreement amounts related to maintenance are allocated based on fair value services performed in the absence of a contract such as consulting and training revenue are recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured 

the deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which has not met our revenue recognition criteria deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to customers in japan to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to customers in japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or market demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on forecasted usage these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

warranty we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses utilizing actual service records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge we update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to take additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

stockbased compensation we account for stockbased awards exchanged for employee services based on the fair value of those awards the fair value of stockbased awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period the fair value is determined using a blackscholes valuation model for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units the blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of assumptions including the option’s expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the marketbased implied volatility from traded options of our common stock 

contingencies and litigation we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

goodwill and intangible assets we assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable longlived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable see note 6 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination we conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit during the three months ended december 31 2010 and concluded that there was no impairment there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the three months ended december 31 2010  the next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the three months ending december 31 2011  

income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that a valuation allowance was necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets but our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed within the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

valuation of marketable securities our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration of the investment the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment default and loss rates of the underlying collateral structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

effects of recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the fasb amended its guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income under the amended guidance an entity has the option to present comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two consecutive financial statements a single statement must present the components of net income and total net income the components of other comprehensive income and total other comprehensive income and a total for comprehensive income in a twostatement approach an entity must present the components of net income and total net income in the first statement that statement must be immediately followed by a financial statement that presents the components of other comprehensive income a total for other comprehensive income and a total for comprehensive income the option under current guidance that permits the presentation of components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity has been eliminated the amendment becomes effective retrospectively for our interim period ending march 31 2012 early adoption is permitted we do not expect that this guidance will have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosureonly in nature 

in may 2011 the fasb amended its guidance to converge fair value measurement and disclosure guidance about fair value measurement under us gaap with international financial reporting standards ifrs ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board  the amendment changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements for many of the requirements the fasb does not intend for the amendment to result in a change in the application of the requirements in the current authoritative guidance the amendment becomes effective prospectively for our interim period ending march 31 2012 early application is not permitted we do not expect the amendment to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2010 the fasb amended its guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets the amendment modifies step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts for those reporting units an entity is required to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if there are qualitative factors indicating that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance which requires goodwill of a reporting unit to be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount this amendment was effective for our interim period ended march 31 2011 the amendment did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2010 the fasb amended its guidance on business combinations under the amended guidance a public entity that presents comparative financial statements must disclose the revenues and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual reporting period the amendment was effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date was on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2010 early adoption is permitted the amendment did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in april 2010 the fasb amended its guidance on sharebased payment awards denominated in certain currencies the amendment clarifies that an employee sharebased payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity’s equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market performance or service condition therefore an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity this amendment becomes effective for our interim period ending september 30 2011 we do not expect the implementation to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in january 2010 the fasb issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements this guidance now requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the reasons for these transfers this authoritative guidance also requires enhanced disclosure of activity in level 3 fair value measurements the guidance for level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements was effective for our interim reporting period ended march 31 2010 the implementation did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosureonly in nature the guidance for level 3 fair value measurements disclosures becomes effective for our interim reporting period ending september 30 2011 and we do not expect that this guidance will have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosureonly in nature 

executive summary 

klatencor corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries our broad portfolio of products and services primarily supports integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” manufacturers throughout the semiconductor fabrication process from research and development to final volume production we provide leadingedge equipment software and support that enable ic manufacturers to identify resolve and 

manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost in addition to serving the semiconductor industry we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries including the light emitting diode “led” data storage and photovoltaic industries as well as general materials research 

our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer ic lithography reticle reticle or mask and disk manufacturers in the world our equipment services and expertise are used by our customers to measure and control nanometriclevel manufacturing processes and to detect analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment our revenues are driven largely by our customers spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets  memory foundry and logic all three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in enduser demand which influences the level and pattern of our customers spending on our products and services although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has been historically very cyclical the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics communications data processing and industrial products has resulted in favorable longterm revenue growth rates for our process control and yield management solutions we believe that over the long term our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications as well as to reduce cost we expect that this in turn will drive longterm increased adoption of process control equipment and services that reduce semiconductor defectivity and improve manufacturing yields 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries we are subject to the cyclical capital spending that characterizes these industries the timing length and volatility of a capacity oriented capital spending cycle of our customers are unpredictable in addition our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability nonetheless we believe that over the longterm our customers will continue to increase their total spending on process control and yield management solutions in response to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes the transition to new production materials new device and circuit architecture more demanding lithography processes the transition from 300 millimeter to 450 millimeter wafers and new backend packaging techniques 

the growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices in communications consumer electronics data processing and automotive and aerospace products combined with a somewhat improved economic environment during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011  particularly in asia caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity these investments included process control and yield management equipment and services which had a significant favorable impact on our revenues compared to the prior fiscal year the resulting increase in revenues allowed us to leverage our infrastructure and improve manufacturing capacity utilization driving an improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue again as compared to the previous year 

in recent weeks however there have been indications that the industry demand environment may be slowing in the nearterm as some of our customers appear to be reassessing their capacity expansion plans and timelines nevertheless we believe that our customers remain committed to their roadmaps toward shrinking device sizes and other technological advancements as a means for driving future competitive differentiation and to lower costs leaving the longer term drivers underlying growth in our industry intact 

the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years   



the results for the fiscal years ended june 30 2011 and 2010 reflected improved fundamentals in the semiconductor industry driven by reduced uncertainty over the global economic environment and continued economic growth in much of asia as we increased our business activity levels and shipped more products to our customers during the fiscal years ended june 30 2011 and 2010 we continued to maintain cost discipline which resulted in improved gross margins as well as net income 

the results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 were adversely impacted by the weak demand for semiconductor capital equipment and service due to the unfavorable global economic and industry conditions the macroeconomic uncertainty led our customers to significantly reduce their factory operations and spending while we took actions to restructure our operations and reduce our cost structure in response to the deteriorating market conditions the rapid decline in revenues resulted in a significant deterioration in gross margins and a net loss our financial results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 also included significant charges associated with impairment of goodwill purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets as well as restructuring programs in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we completed the acquisition of the microelectronic inspection equipment business unit “mie business unit” of vistec semiconductor systems for net cash consideration of 1414 million the acquired mie business unit is a provider of mask registration measurement tools scanning electron microscope “sem” based tools for mask critical dimension measurement and macro defect inspection systems 

revenues and gross margin   



product revenues 

product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 primarily as a result of increased shipment and acceptance of our products within the year many of our customers continued to maintain high levels of capital spending for advanced technology development as well as capacity related investments resulting in an increase in the number of tools that we sold and revenues that we recognized across each of the three major semiconductor markets memory foundry and logic compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  our revenues have continued to grow each quarter over the past two years as we continued to increase production ship products and provide services to our customers to meet their process control and yield management requirements an increase in the sales of both our defect inspection and metrology equipment contributed to the increase in the number of tools that we sold during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 

product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 as a result of increased capital spending by customers for both technology and capacity related investments of process control equipment in response to strong semiconductor electronics end market demand new semiconductor manufacturing products targeted towards advanced production nodes were significant contributors to this increase in revenue as customers particularly those serving the foundry market added production capacity these factors contributed to an increase in the number of tools that we sold during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009  the increase in tool sales over fiscal year ended june 30 2009 was primarily driven by an increase in our sales of defect inspection equipment 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2011  2010 and 2009  the following customers each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues 



service revenues 

service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period the amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems service revenues continued to steadily increase during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 compared to the fiscal years ended june 30 2010 and 2009 as a result of an increase in the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers sites as well as higher factory utilization by our customers 

revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows 

a significant portion of our revenues continue to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that trend to continue 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions over the past several years we have embarked on various advanced product development customer satisfaction improvement and globalization initiatives to improve our competitiveness and gross margins over the past eight quarters our gross margin has generally benefited from the operating efficiencies associated with increasing revenues over that period 

the following tables summarize the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage 

changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues it also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and average customer pricing changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements this includes the impact of capacity utilization use of overtime and variability of cost structure changes in gross 

margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk 

our gross margin increased to 603 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 from 552 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 primarily due to increased demand and revenue from the sale of advanced technology defect inspection and metrology products 

our gross margin percentage increased to 552 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 from 431 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 primarily due to demand for new high value products significant volume efficiencies in manufacturing operations worldwide lower inventory obsolescence as well as a lower overall manufacturing cost structure as a result of our outsourcing and globalization initiatives in addition productivity improvements resulting from better utilization of field service resources contributed to the gross margin improvement 

engineering research and development “rd”   



rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  primarily due to an increase in engineering material costs of 242 million for program development related to our nextgeneration defect inspection products an increase in employeerelated expenses of 278 million as a result of additional engineering headcount and higher variable compensation and an increase in external services of 97 million to support expanded rd activities partially offset by an increase of 51 million in benefit to rd expense from external funding 

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009  even as we made significant investments in product research and development the decrease during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 was primarily attributable to cost reduction activities initiated during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009  the benefits of which were fully realized in the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  partially offset by higher variable compensation in addition development material costs and consulting services related to rd product development decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 as certain significant new products completed the product development cycle during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 and came to market in the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  the decrease in rd expenses primarily consisted of a decrease in employeerelated expenses of 112 million a decrease in engineering material costs of 141 million a decrease in external services of 51 million and a decrease in depreciation of fixed assets amortization of intangibles and expensed inprocess rd “iprd” of 155 million offset by a decrease in benefit to rd expense from external funding of 80 million 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we expensed iprd of 86 million upon the completion of the acquisitions during the applicable fiscal year in connection with acquired intellectual property for which as of the acquisition date technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed the fair value of the purchased iprd was determined using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value future cash flows were estimated taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology relevant market sizes and industry trends we determined a discount rate for each project based on the relative risks inherent in the project’s development horizon the estimated costs of development and the level of technological change in the project and the industry among other factors iprd was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed the development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility rapidly changing customer markets uncertain standards for new products and significant competitive threats the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning designing experimenting and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations including functionality and technical requirements 

rd expenses include the benefit of 188 million  137 million and 217 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended june 30 2011  2010 and 2009  respectively for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants we expect our rd expenses to increase with increases in our business activity levels as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes 

selling general and administrative “sga” 

  



sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 primarily due to increases in employeerelated expenses of 370 million as a result of additional headcount to support higher sales volume and higher variable compensation partially offset by a decrease in asset impairment charges of 134 million a decrease in legal expenses of 91 million related to our historical stock option practices and certain indemnification obligations and an increase in bad debt recovery of 67 million 

sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 primarily due to cost reduction activities initiated during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009  the benefits of which were fully realized in the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  partially offset by higher variable compensation the decrease in sga expenses primarily consisted of a decrease in employeerelated expenses of 213 million and a decrease in depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangibles of 105 million partially offset by an increase in legal expenses for stockholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices of 30 million in addition 29 million of bad debt recovery was recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  compared to 232 million of bad debt expense recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009  

interest income and other net 



interest income and other net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities gains or losses from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts and impairments associated with equity investments in privatelyheld companies the decrease in interest income and other net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 was primarily attributable to impairment charges of 99 million recorded during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 for equity investments in privatelyheld companies and partially offset by an international tax reserve benefit of 159 million due to the expiration of a statute of limitations relating to an uncertainty in our position with respect to a foreign transactionbased tax during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  interest income and other net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 remained flat 

interest expense is primarily attributable to the 750 million aggregate principal amount of senior fixed rate notes that we issued in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

provision for income taxes 

the following table provides details of income taxes 

  



the provision for income taxes differs from the statutory us federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates and tax credits offset by state taxes the tax effects of employee stock activity and other factors 

tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 was 284 compared to 271 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010  tax expense increased primarily from an increase in state tax expense a decrease in the benefit from lower income earned outside the us with lower tax rates and an increase in tax reserves offset by a decrease in the effect of shortfalls from employee stock activity 

tax expense as a percentage of income during the year ended june 30 2010 was 271 compared to a benefit of 131 as a percentage of a loss in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009  the difference in the percentages was primarily due to a decrease in the benefit on the loss incurred in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 from a goodwill impairment charge of 2770 million related to certain business units which was nondeductible for tax purposes and 381 million in additional tax expense due to a reduction in noncurrent deferred tax assets the reduction in the deferred tax asset was a result of the adoption of california budget legislation signed on february 20 2009 which will allow a taxpayer to elect an alternative method to attribute taxable income to california for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2011 we expect to make the election to use the alternative method to attribute taxable income to california for our fiscal year ending june 30 2012 in addition there was less income earned outside the us subject to lower tax rates in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income the domestic manufacturing deduction nontaxable or nondeductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

we incurred 152 million and 120 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 and 2010 respectively due to shortfalls from employee stock activity windfall tax benefits arise when a companys tax deduction for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity a shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value shortfalls are recorded as decreases to capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes 

for the fiscal year ending june 30 2012  cumulative shortfalls from employee stock activity may continue to exceed cumulative windfalls from employee stock activity and we may therefore report higher provision for income taxes as a result because we cannot determine all of the factors that will enter into our income tax expense computation for the fiscal year ending june 30 2012  we cannot currently estimate this impact on our tax rate for the next fiscal year 

in the normal course of business we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

liquidity and capital resources 



as of june 30 2011  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 2 billion  which is an increase of 504 million from june 30 2010  as of june 30 2011  678 million of the 2 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices we currently intend to permanently reinvest approximately 421 million of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries if however a portion of these funds were to be needed for our operations in the united states we would be required to accrue and pay us and foreign taxes of approximately 3050 of the funds repatriated the amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated we have accrued but have not paid us taxes on the remaining cash of 257 million of the 678 million held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices as such these funds can be returned to the us without accruing any additional us tax expense 

the total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended june 30 2011  2010 and 2009 was 167 million  102 million and 102 million  respectively the increase in the total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 compared to the preceding fiscal years reflects an increase during the quarter ended september 30 2010 to the level of our quarterly dividend from 015 to 025 per share on july 12 2011 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from 025 to 035 per share 

the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have decreased our basic and diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding the decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of employee restricted stock units and in connection with stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan in october 2008 we suspended our stock repurchase program and we subsequently restarted the program in february 2010 

we have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations 

fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 

cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 from 448 million to 823 million primarily as a result of the following key factors

cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 from 228 million to 360 million primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of availableforsale and trading securities net of sales and maturities of approximately 124 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 

cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 from 216 million to 300 million as a result of the following key factors 

 fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 

cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 from 196 million to 448 million primarily as a result of the following key factors 

 cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 declined compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 from 485 million to 228 million primarily as a result of the following key factors 

 cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 declined compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 from 299 million to 216 million as a result of lower common stock repurchases we repurchased 136 million of our common stock during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to 227 million in stock repurchases during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june 30 2011  

  



  

 we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition from time to time we will discount without recourse letters of credit “lcs” received from customers in payment for goods 

the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lcs and related discounting fees paid for the years ended june 30 2011  2010 and 2009  



  

 we maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to 204 million  of which 179 million had been issued as of june 30 2011 primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for vat and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in europe and asia 

we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecasted timehorizon can vary among different suppliers our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately 352 million as of june 30 2011  and are primarily due within the next 12 months actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 

we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates nonstandard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

working capital increased to 28 billion as of june 30 2011  compared to 21 billion as of june 30 2010  this increase is primarily due to cash generated from operations offset by cash payments for our stock repurchase program cash payments of dividends to stockholders and purchases of fixed assets as of june 30 2011  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 20 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 

our credit ratings and outlooks as of july 11 2011 are summarized below   



factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under our foreign currency risk management strategy we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates this financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months see note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description our outstanding hedge contracts with maximum maturity of 18 months were as follows   



indemnification obligations subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us these obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws applicable contracts and delaware and california law the obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters we paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors officers and employees we are currently paying defense costs to one former officer and employee facing an sec civil action to which we are not a party 

although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is theoretically unlimited we believe the fair value of this liability to the extent estimable is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings 

we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters typically these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from or provide customers with other remedies to protect against bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products noncompliance with our product performance specifications infringement by our products of thirdparty intellectual property rights and a breach of warranties representations and covenants related to such matters as title to assets sold validity of certain intellectual property rights noninfringement of thirdparty rights and certain income taxrelated matters in each of these circumstances payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract this usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants to control the defense or settlement of any thirdparty claims brought against the other party further our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts activity typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party and duration in some instances we may have recourse against third parties andor insurance covering certain payments made by us 

it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of june 30 2011  actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2011  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 13 billion excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 from levels as of june 30 2011  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by 11 million 

as of june 30 2011  we had net forward and option contracts to sell 690 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2011  the us dollar equivalent would have been 691 million  a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 183 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows 

in april 2008 we issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of 690 senior unsecured notes due in 2018 the fair market value of longterm fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of june 30 2011  the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were 7463 million and 8635 million  respectively as of june 30 2010  the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were 7457 million and 8344 million  respectively

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the ceo and cfo the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation the company’s management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2011  

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2011 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of 

two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

industry 

general background 

the semiconductor industry is klatencor’s core focus the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is six eight or twelve inches in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers and polished to a mirror finish 

  

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper “interconnect” structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when all of the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality the wafer is then cut into individual devices and those chips that passed functional testing are packaged final testing is performed on all packaged chips 

current trends 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to highvolume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trends such as a specific design rule shrink in today’s market driven by consumer demand for lowcost electronic goods from smart phones and mp3 players to laptops and portable devices the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in bringing a multitude of new process technologies into production at the same time some requiring new substrate and film materials new geometries and advanced lithography techniques 

while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected their adoption into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects while device performance characteristics namely speed capacity or power management become more sensitive to such parameters as linewidth and film thickness variation new process materials such as highk dielectrics silicononinsulator “soi” wafers and immersion lithographycapable photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 5 billion substantially more than previous generation facilities in addition chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment 

by developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment “roi” once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume our tools help ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution in addition the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules coupled with new materials and device innovation has increased inprocess variability which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling 

klatencor systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer reticle and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems the ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying 

  

process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes this helps them increase their yield of highperformance parts and deliver their products to market ahead of their competitors—thus maximizing their profit with our broad portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ nextgeneration products including those required for the 32nm chip generation and beyond

product table 

the following table presents a representative list of the products that we offered during the course of the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 

 

   

   

customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout asia the united states and europe staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers in each of these regions for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 two customers taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and intel corporation each accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 two customers intel corporation and samsung electronics co ltd each accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues 

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are aimed at building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility that are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier our revenues are derived primarily from product sales mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in asia the united states and europe we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2010 we employed approximately 2030 sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of whollyowned subsidiaries or branches in other countries including belgium china france germany hong kong india israel italy japan singapore south korea taiwan and the united kingdom international revenues accounted for approximately 81 76 and 79 of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended june 30 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 17 “segment reporting and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country the revenues from our international business may also be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in nondollar product sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be 

  

adequate these factors as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in item 1a “risk factors” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our shipment backlog for systems and associated warranty totaled 992 million and 332 million as of june 30 2010 and 2009 respectively and includes sales orders where written customer requests have been received and the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months orders for service contracts and unreleased products are excluded from shipment backlog all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer often with limited or no penalties we make adjustments for shipment backlog obtained from acquired companies sales order cancellations customer delivery date changes and currency adjustments our shipment backlog is not subject to our normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our basic financial statements in addition the concept of shipment backlog is not defined in the accounting literature making comparisons between periods and with other companies difficult and potentially misleading 

our revenue backlog which includes sales orders where deliveries have been completed but for which revenue has not been recognized pursuant to our policy for revenue recognition totaled 343 million and 186 million as of june 30 2010 and 2009 respectively orders for service contracts are excluded from revenue backlog 

because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between on the one hand our ability to manufacture deliver and install products and on the other the requirements of our customers in our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources management of our operating model and other factors we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing deliveries and installations of products which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products 

research and development 

the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs in addition we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby certain government agencies or other third parties fund a portion of our research and development costs as of june 30 2010 we employed approximately 1100 research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during fiscal year 2010 involved the development of process control and yield management equipment for sub65nm processing for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product research and development even during the recent down cycles in the semiconductor industry we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to contribute to the 

  

continuing developments in our industries new product introductions however may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products and if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in the united states milpitas california singapore israel belgium and germany as of june 30 2010 we employed approximately 800 manufacturing personnel 

some critical parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications while other parts are standard commercial products we use numerous vendors to supply parts for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts by monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers and by ensuring adequate inventories of key parts are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have such as applied materials inc and hitachi electronics engineering co ltd we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability installed base and technical service and support 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

  

acquisitions and alliances 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

employees 

as of june 30 2010 we employed approximately 5000 people none of our employees are represented by a labor union however our employees in france pursuant to french industrial relations law and in the german operations of our mie business unit are represented by employee work councils we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees

 item 1a risk factors tableend a description of factors that could materially affect our business financial condition or operating results is provided below 

risks associated with our industry and market conditions 

the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict the cyclical nature of the primary industry in which we operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization consumer demand for products inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital this cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels in the current environment our ability to accurately predict our future operating results is particularly limited during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in or cancellation or delay of orders which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues as was experienced during fiscal year 2009 we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results then our business could be seriously harmed furthermore any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

in addition the semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time these changes currently or in the future may include the increasing cost of building and operating fabrication facilities and the impact of such increases on our customers’ investment decisions the variability of future growth rates in the semiconductor and related industries the everincreasing cost and complexity involved in the adoption by our customers of technology advances and the potential impact that may have on their rate of adoption pricing trends in the endmarkets for consumer electronics and other products which places a growing emphasis on our customers’ cost of ownership overall changes in capital spending patterns by our customers and demand by semiconductor manufacturers for shorter cycle times for developing manufacturing and installing capital equipment further many semiconductor manufacturers have recently experienced decreased profitability causing them to enter into collaboration or sharing arrangements for capacity cost or risk with other manufacturers outsource manufacturing activities focus only on specific markets or applications or purchase less manufacturing equipment any of the changes described in this paragraph may particularly during periods of challenging macroeconomic conditions negatively affect our customers’ rate of investment in capital equipment which could result in downward pressure on our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

  

we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy 

the severe tightening of the credit markets turmoil in the financial markets and weakening of the global economy that were experienced during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 contributed to slowdowns in the industries in which we operate which slowdowns could recur or worsen if economic conditions were to deteriorate again 

the markets for semiconductors and therefore our business are ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending which in the recent economic slowdown caused our customers to decrease cancel or delay their equipment and service orders from us in addition the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit that accompanied that slowdown made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell reduced demand combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of such financing has in recent periods adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels 

in addition a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities auction rate securities money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and where applicable credit ratings and government guarantees of the underlying investments a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market values of our investments and their liquidity if the market value of such investments were to decline or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology which is the result of continuing significant investments in product research and development however we may enter new markets whether through acquisitions or new internal product development in which competition is based primarily on product pricing not technological superiority further some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

  

we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been and is becoming increasingly highly concentrated in this environment orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales in addition the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year if customers do not place orders or they delay or cancel orders we may not be able to replace the business furthermore because our products are configured to customer specifications any changes delays or cancellations of orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs as a result of the consolidation within our customer base the customers that survive that consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales those surviving customers may have more aggressive policies regarding engaging alternative secondsource suppliers for the products we serve and in addition may seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us any of these changes could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues and gross margins also certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes experienced management changes or have outsourced manufacturing activities any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions as a result of the recent challenging economic environment we have been exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial viability of certain of our customers to the extent our customers experience liquidity issues we may be required to incur additional bad debt expense with respect to receivables owed to us by those customers in addition customers with liquidity issues may be forced to discontinue operations or may be acquired by one of our customers and in either case such event would have the effect of further consolidating our customer base any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our business 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions for example the size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink and the industry is currently transitioning to the use of new materials and innovative fab processes while we expect these trends will increase our customers’ reliance on diagnostic products such as ours we cannot be sure that these trends will directly improve our business these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards to develop and introduce new products that successfully address changing customer needs to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner 

in this environment we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance features and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

  

our business would be harmed if we do not receive parts sufficient in number and performance to meet our production requirements and product specification in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers also key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers’ proprietary intellectual property in those cases we are increasingly reliant on third parties for highperformance hightechnology components which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products in addition if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations which is a heightened risk during economic downturns that would affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations or in the operations of our customers due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders delays in deliveries or other business activities or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states singapore israel belgium and germany in addition our business is international in nature with our sales service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors as well as our other operations and those of our customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism health epidemics fire earthquake volcanic eruptions energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in among other things shipments of products to our customers our ability to perform services requested by our customers or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites we cannot ensure that alternate means of conducting our operations whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if such alternate means were available they could be obtained on favorable terms 

as part of our costcutting actions we have consolidated several operating facilities our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described in the preceding paragraph such as acts of war or terrorism earthquakes fires or other natural disasters if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting functions to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations disruptions or delays at our third 

  

party service providers due to events such as regional economic business environmental or political events information technology system failures or military actions could adversely impact our operations and our ability to ship products manage our product inventory or record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business in addition we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects the termination of any such collaboration or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration could significantly impair our research and development efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

we might be involved in intellectual property disputes or other intellectual property infringement claims that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information in addition we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties litigation tends to be expensive and requires significant management time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of operations or business if we lose or have to settle a case on significantly adverse terms our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms 

  

or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms or the instigation of litigation or other administrative proceedings could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future our business and operations could be harmed 

if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan our operating results business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted 

we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually revised frequently generally quarterly and reviewed by management even more frequently at least monthly our business plan is developed based on a number of factors many of which require estimates and assumptions such as our expectations of the economic environment future business levels our customers’ willingness and ability to place orders leadtimes and future revenue and cash flow our budgeted operating expenses for example are based in part on our future revenue expectations however our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors including the volatile and cyclical nature of our industry customer order cancellations macroeconomic changes operational matters regarding particular agreements our ability to manage customer deliveries and resources for the installation and acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to manage delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a 

because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results similarly if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period which would also negatively affect our results of operations if we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted such an outcome could cause customers suppliers or investors to view us as less stable or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or stock price 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as 

  

well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected in addition we may lose key employees of the acquired companies as a result risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 at times we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary highly sensitive information the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements is becoming increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism which affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business increased international political instability in various parts of the world disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations such continuing instability could cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate this same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability 

  

to timely deliver their products if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we self insure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain other risks are uninsurable or are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations a significant portion of which are conducted in california an area highly susceptible to earthquakes it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products much of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we self insure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also selfinsured either based on a similar costbenefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices or changes in interpretations of such standards practices or rules can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and may occur in the future changes to or revised interpretations of existing tax or accounting rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

for example the adoption of the authoritative guidance for stockbased compensation  which required us to measure all employee stockbased compensation awards using a fair value method beginning in fiscal year 2006 and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements has had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in stockbased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws for example proposals for fundamental us international tax reform such as the recent proposal by president obama’s administration if enacted changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes a change in our effective tax rate can adversely impact our results from operations 

we are exposed to various risks related to the legal regulatory and tax environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to compliance with new existing different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust and export control regulations for example we are subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with our global business operations including regulations related to the development manufacture and use of our products 

  

recycling and disposal of materials used in our products or in producing our products the operation of our facilities and the use of our real property our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws rules or regulations or changes to existing laws rules or regulations including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our reported financial results or our ability to conduct our business 

in addition we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment contracts product performance product liability antitrust environmental regulations securities unfair competition and other matters in addition to proceedings and claims related to intellectual property matters which are separately discussed elsewhere in this item 1a these legal proceedings and claims regardless of their merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit our ability to sell our products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims which could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and our ability to operate our business 

we are also exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies both domestically and internationally governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future in addition under the terms of these government grants the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur directly and indirectly in connection with such programs any such audit could result in modifications to or even termination of the applicable government funding program for example if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program those costs would not be reimbursed and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded we do not know the outcome of any future audits any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties financial or otherwise termination of funding programs suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency any of which could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and our ability to operate our business 

furthermore we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations 

a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states and we maintain significant operations outside the united states we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents challenges associated with among other things cultural diversity and organizational alignment moreover each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period periodic local or international economic downturns trade balance issues tariffs or other trade barriers political instability legal or regulatory changes or terrorism in regions where we have operations or where we do business along with fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our business and results of operations although we attempt to manage nearterm currency risks through the use of hedging instruments there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate 

  

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the euro and the japanese yen we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally in addition an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the united states and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with various financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected furthermore if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge we may experience material financial losses 

we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements 

we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions any of which may prove not to be financially viable if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables however by entering into these arrangements and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services we are exposed to additional risks if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

there are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness 

as of june 30 2010 we had 750 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness represented by our senior notes that will mature in 2018 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and the other risk factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities factors that can affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of our senior notes we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of the senior notes our ability to repurchase the senior notes in such event may be limited by law by the indenture associated with the senior notes or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time if we fail to repurchase the senior notes as required by the indenture it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations 

  

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

our board of directors first instituted a quarterly dividend during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 since that time we have announced two increases in the amount of our quarterly dividend level we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us future dividends may be affected by among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development legal risks stock repurchase programs changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws and changes to our business model our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings in addition we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock 

our investment portfolio consists of both corporate and government securities that have a maximum effective maturity of 10 years the longer the duration of these securities the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields as yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates and bond yields 

in addition the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets our operating results or other performance metrics or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies 

we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our business 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we recorded material restructuring charges of 387 million related to our global workforce reduction large excess inventory writeoffs of 856 million and material impairment charges of 4467 million related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions once again we may implement additional cost reduction actions which would require us to take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to among other things employee terminations or exit costs we may also be required to write off additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline and such additional writeoffs could constitute material charges 

as noted above we recorded a material charge during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using the straightline method and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for longlived assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including 

  

revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to calculate the amount of such impairment charge could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge 

any such additional material charges whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements 

we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions including our indemnification of third parties as well as the performance of our products 

although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties costly and timeconsuming litigation or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes or could impact our revenue or cost recognition any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in our commercial agreements from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and lessors with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes in addition notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations whether or not asserted due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects especially when products are first introduced unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us including increased service or warranty costs providing product replacements for or modifications to defective products litigation related to defective products product recalls or product writeoffs or disposal costs these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business financial condition and operating results in addition our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

  

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operation our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations 

our global operations are linked by information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications despite our implementation of network security measures our tools and servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems and tools located at customer sites or could be subject to system failures or malfunctions for other reasons system failures or malfunctioning such as difficulties with our customer relationship management “crm” system could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results in addition any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our enterprise resource planning “erp” system or other systems whether in connection with the regular operation of such systems or as a result of the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 any such event could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered 

in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws if we were to violate any such law we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend government inquiries and sec settlement relating to historical stock option practices 

several government agencies previously conducted investigations beginning in may 2006 concerning the company’s past stock options grants and related accounting matters including investigations by the sec and united states attorney’s office “usao” an examination of our 401k savings plan “plan” by the us department of labor “dol” and an audit covering calendar year 2006 by the internal revenue service “irs” as previously reported the sec investigation was resolved with respect to the company by a nonmonetary settlement in july 2007 the usao advised us that it had closed its investigation and determined not to take any action against the company in july 2008 the irs concluded its audit with a payment by the company of 01 million in july 2008 and the dol closed its examination on the basis of the plan’s election to participate in our previously announced shareholder class action settlement at no additional cost to the company and our separate settlement with the plan’s independent fiduciary under which we paid the plan 25000 and denied all liability these matters are now closed 

litigation relating to historical stock option practices 

beginning on may 22 2006 several shareholder derivative actions were filed on behalf of and in the name of the company against several of our current and former directors and officers relating to our historical stock options and related accounting from 1994 to 2006 consisting of a consolidated action in the us district court for the northern district of california the “federal derivative action” an action in the california superior court for santa clara county “california action” and one in the delaware chancery court “delaware action” 

as previously reported on march 15 2010 we entered into a stipulation of settlement the “stipulation” with all parties to the federal derivative action to resolve the federal derivative action in its entirety subject to approval by the federal district court the “settlement” by addendum to the stipulation filed on may 17 2010 the plaintiffs in the california action and in the delaware action joined in the settlement the federal district court approved the settlement and entered its final judgment and order dismissing the federal derivative action with prejudice on may 26 2010 thereafter the california action was dismissed with prejudice on june 1 2010 and the delaware action was dismissed with prejudice on june 2 2010 the settlement became final and effective by its terms on june 28 2010 

as set forth more fully in the stipulation under the settlement among other things i we received cash payments totaling 24 million from insurers ii we received additional cash payments of approximately 92 million from certain of the settling defendants iii certain of the settling defendants relinquished compensation and other benefits of approximately 94 million iv we paid attorneys’ fees to plaintiffs’ counsel in the amount of 8 million in cash in addition to 8 million in shares of our common stock v the federal derivative action was dismissed with prejudice vi the company settling defendants related parties and plaintiffs and their counsel have been released from claims related to the federal derivative action and the matters that were or could have been alleged therein and further litigation on such claims is barred and vii we committed to maintain certain corporate governance enhancements including certain previously implemented policies procedures and guidelines relating to our board of directors composition stock option granting practices and procedures and internal controls and procedures this summary of the terms of the stipulation is qualified entirely by reference to the copy of the stipulation filed as exhibit 991 to the current report on form 8k filed by the company with the sec on march 26 2010 the content of which is incorporated by reference herein under the addendum to the stipulation the california action and delaware action were also dismissed with 

  

prejudice during the year ended june 30 2010 we recorded a charge of 13 million to selling general and administrative expenses reflecting the anticipated net amount to be paid by the company in connection with the settlement and the company’s settlements during such period of separate matters with kenneth schroeder and kenneth levy as also previously reported and further described below as a result of the settlement the shareholder derivative litigation arising from our historical stock options grants and related practices is now concluded 

the company was also previously named as a defendant along with various of its current and former officers in putative securities class actions arising from its historical stock options grants and related matters in state and federal court beginning in june 2006 those actions were resolved by settlement or dismissal as previously reported 

finally we entered into settlements of litigation and arbitration claims filed by our former ceo kenneth schroeder in connection with the termination of his employment and cancellation of certain of his stock options and restricted stock units in 2006 and also settled claims asserted by our former ceo and chairman of the board kenneth levy relating to our alleged refusal to permit the exercise of certain stock options in 2007 and 2008 we recorded the expenses associated with these settlements in our selling general and administrative expenses during the three months ended march 31 2010 the settlements have been performed and are now final 

as a result of the foregoing all litigation matters to which we were a party arising from our historical stock option grants and related practices are now closed 

indemnification obligations 

subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us these obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws applicable contracts and delaware and california law the obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters we paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors officers and employees we are also paying defense costs to two former officers and employees facing sec civil actions to which we are not a party although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is theoretically unlimited we believe the fair value of this liability to the extent estimable is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings 

other legal matters 

we are named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of its business actions filed against us include commercial intellectual property customer and labor and employment related claims including complaints of alleged wrongful termination and potential class action lawsuits regarding alleged violations of federal and state wage and hour and other laws litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial regardless of outcome we believe the amounts provided in our financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimated liabilities however because such matters are subject to many uncertainties the ultimate outcomes are not predictable and there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from the matters described above will not exceed the amounts reflected in our financial statements or will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements which involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed the company’s related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured we derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems spare parts and services we typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications under certain circumstances however we recognize revenue prior to written acceptance from the customer as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 24 14 and 16 of total revenues for the fiscal years ended june 30 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in revenue recognized without a written acceptance for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 was primarily driven by higher shipments of the same tools with same specifications that have previously been accepted at the applicable customer fabs the decrease in revenue recognized without a written acceptance for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 was 

  

primarily driven by lower shipments of tools that had already met the required acceptance criteria at those customer fabs shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues 

tradein rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases we estimate the value of the tradein right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale this amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the tradein right or the expiration of the tradein right 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract services performed in the absence of a contract such as consulting and training revenue are recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured 

the deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which has not met the revenue recognition criteria of the company deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to customers in japan to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance shipments to customers in japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences 

revenue recognition for certain arrangements with software elements andor multiple deliverables in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the product’s essential functionality from the scope of industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance in october 2009 the fasb also amended the accounting standards for multipledeliverable revenue arrangements to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our second quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30 2010 and have applied the adoption retrospectively to the beginning of the fiscal year to apply the guidance to transactions originating or materially modified after june 30 2009 the implementation resulted in additional qualitative disclosures that are included in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements but did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

for transactions entered into through june 30 2009 we primarily recognized revenue based on the guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 104 during the period for the majority of our arrangements involving multiple deliverables the entire amount of the sales contract was allocated to each respective element based on its relative selling price using fair value in the limited circumstances when we were not able to determine fair value for the deliverables in the arrangement but were able to obtain fair value for the undelivered elements revenue was allocated using the residual method under the residual method the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equaled the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate selling price of any undelivered elements and no revenue was recognized until all elements without fair value had been delivered if fair value of any undelivered elements did not exist the entire amount of the sales contract was deferred until all elements were accepted by the customer 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or market demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value 

we review and set standard costs semiannually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and wasted materials spoilage are recognized as current period charges 

we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on past usage these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

warranty we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses utilizing actual service records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge we update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to take additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

stockbased compensation we account for stockbased awards exchanged for employee services based on the fair value of those awards the fair value of stockbased awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period the fair value is determined using a blackscholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units the blackscholes 

  

optionpricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the option’s expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the marketbased implied volatility from traded options of our common stock 

contingencies and litigation we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

goodwill and intangible assets we assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable longlived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable see note 6 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination we conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit during the quarter ended december 31 2009 and concluded that there was no impairment there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 

income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance that requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that a valuation allowance was necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets but our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed within the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

  

valuation of marketable securities our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration of the investment the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

fair value measurements we adopted authoritative guidance for fair value measurements as of the beginning of fiscal year 2009 in february 2008 the fasb issued a provision that allowed companies to elect a oneyear delay in applying the fair value measurements guidance to certain fair value measurements primarily related to nonfinancial assets and liabilities we elected the delayed adoption date for our nonfinancial assets and liabilities impacted by the guidance this guidance defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the adoption of the guidance relating to the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets and liabilities on july 1 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition see note 2 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements 

concurrently with the adoption of the fair value measurement and disclosure provisions we adopted authoritative guidance that permits entities to elect at specified election dates to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value see note 2 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements 

effects of recent accounting pronouncements 

in april 2010 the fasb amended its guidance on sharebased payment awards denominated in certain currencies the amendment clarifies that an employee sharebased payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity’s equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market performance or service condition therefore an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity this amendment becomes effective for our interim period ending september 30 2011 we do not expect the implementation to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in april 2010 the fasb amended the authoritative guidance addressing accounting for arrangements in which a vendor satisfies its performance obligations over time with all or a portion of the consideration contingent on future events referred to as “milestones” the scope of the new guidance is limited to milestones in arrangements that involve research or development activities such as the successful completion of a drug study phase the amendment provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate a vendor can recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive a vendor that is affected by the amendments is required to provide a description of the overall arrangement a description of each milestone and related contingent consideration a determination of whether each milestone is considered substantive the factors that 

  

the entity considered in determining whether the milestone or milestones are substantive and the amount of consideration recognized during the period for the milestone or milestones this amendment becomes effective for our interim period ending september 30 2010 and we do not expect the amendment to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in march 2010 the fasb amended the authoritative guidance on derivatives and hedging the amendment addresses the scope exception related to embedded credit derivatives to clarify when analysis of an embedded credit derivative for bifurcation from the host contract is not required it specifies that embedded credit derivatives not qualifying for the scope exception such as an embedded derivative related to a credit default swap on a referenced credit would be subject to a bifurcation analysis even if their effects are allocated to interests in subordinated tranches of securitized financial instruments the amended guidance requires that an entity separately disclose on an instrumentbyinstrument basis the gross gains and gross losses that comprise the cumulativeeffect adjustment that results from adopting the amended guidance the amended guidance becomes effective for our interim period ending september 30 2010 we currently do not hold such derivatives and do not expect the amendment to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2010 the sec issued a policy statement and staff work plan regarding the potential use by us issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards “ifrs” ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board under the proposed timeline set forth by the sec we could be required in fiscal year 2015 to prepare financial statements in accordance with ifrs and the sec is expected to make a determination in 2011 regarding the mandatory adoption of ifrs we are currently assessing the impact that this potential change would have on our consolidated financial statements and we will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of ifrs 

in february 2010 the fasb amended its guidance on subsequent events the amendment states that entities that are required to file or furnish their financial statements with the sec are no longer required to disclose the date through which the entity has evaluated subsequent events this amendment was effective for our interim reporting period ended march 31 2010 and the implementation did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosureonly in nature 

in january 2010 the fasb issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements this guidance now requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the reasons for these transfers this authoritative guidance also requires enhanced disclosure of activity in level 3 fair value measurements the guidance for level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements was effective for our interim reporting period ended march 31 2010 the implementation did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosureonly in nature the guidance for level 3 fair value measurements disclosures becomes effective for our interim reporting period ending september 30 2011 and we do not expect that this guidance will have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosureonly in nature 

in october 2009 the fasb amended its emerging issues task force “eitf” authoritative guidance addressing revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables the guidance requires revenue to be allocated to multiple elements using relative fair value based on vendorspecific objective evidence thirdparty evidence or estimated selling price the residual method also becomes obsolete under this guidance this guidance is effective for our interim reporting period ending september 30 2010 and allows for early adoption we elected to early adopt the accounting guidance at the beginning of the second quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2010 and have applied the adoption retrospectively to the beginning of the fiscal year to apply the guidance to transactions originating or materially modified after june 30 2009 the implementation resulted in additional qualitative disclosures but did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in october 2009 the fasb amended the authoritative guidance addressing certain revenue arrangements that include software elements this guidance states that tangible products with hardware and software components that work together to deliver the product functionality are considered nonsoftware products and the accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables is to be followed with respect to such products this guidance is effective for our interim reporting period ending september 30 2010 and allows for early adoption we elected to early adopt the accounting guidance at the beginning of the second quarter of our fiscal year ending june 30 2010 and have applied the adoption retrospectively to the beginning of the fiscal year to apply the guidance to transactions originating or materially modified after june 30 2009 the implementation resulted in additional qualitative disclosures but did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in august 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance for measuring liabilities at fair value that reaffirms the previously existing definition of fair value and reintroduces the concept of entry value into the determination of fair value of liabilities entry value is the amount an entity would receive to enter into an identical liability the guidance was effective for our interim reporting period ended december 31 2009 the implementation did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in june 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance for consolidations that changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on among other things an entity’s purpose and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance this guidance was effective for our interim reporting period ending september 30 2010 we are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

executive summary 

klatencor corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries within our primary area of focus our comprehensive portfolio of products services software and expertise helps integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process – from research and development to final volume production in addition to the semiconductor industry our technologies serve a number of other industries including the high brightness light emitting diode “hbled” data storage and photovoltaic industries as well as general materials research 

our products and services are used by the vast majority of wafer ic reticle and disk manufacturers in the world our revenues are driven largely by capital spending by our customers who operate in one or more of several key semiconductor markets including the memory foundry and logic markets our customers purchase our products either in response to the need to drive advances in process technologies or to ramp up production to satisfy demand from industries such as communication data processing consumer electronics automotive and aerospace we believe that over the long term our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications as well as reduced cost which in turn will drive increased adoption of process control to reduce defectivity 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries we are subject to business cycles the timing length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict the industries we serve have historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand and manufacturing capacity our ability to predict future capacityrelated capital spending by our customers is extremely limited as such spending is very closely connected to the unpredictable business cycles within their industries while our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been and is becoming increasingly highly concentrated we expect capital spending of our customers on process control to increase over the long term driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address new defects as a result of shrinking device feature sizes the transition to new materials new device and circuit architecture new lithography challenges and fab process innovation 

the demand for our products is generally affected by the profitability of our customers which is driven by capacity and market supply for their products as well as the willingness and ability of our customers to invest in new technologies the increase in the semiconductor content in communication data processing consumer electronics automotive and aerospace products combined with the improving global economic environment during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 favorably impacted our customers and consequently accelerated the demand for our products as our customers accelerate capital investments we have started to increase production volumes to support anticipated customer demand however we cannot predict the duration and sustainability of the improving business conditions as we increase production volumes and make commitments to increase our capacity in anticipation of improved business conditions we remain at risk of incurring inventoryrelated and other restructuring charges if the recent improved business conditions do not continue 

the following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years 

 

   

the results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 reflected improved fundamentals in the semiconductor industry driven by improvement in the economic environment and strong demand from our foundry customers sales of our products and demand for our services improved as our customers ramped up their operations in response to improved market conditions even as we increased our business activity levels and shipped more products to our customers during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 we maintained tight controls over costs which resulted in strong gross margins as well as net income 

the results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 indicated the weak demand for semiconductor capital equipment and service due to the unfavorable global economic and industry conditions the macroeconomic uncertainty led our customers to significantly reduce their factory operations and spending while we took actions to restructure our operations and reduce our cost structure in response to the deteriorating market conditions the rapid decline in revenues resulted in a significant deterioration in gross margins and a net loss in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we completed the acquisition of the microelectronic inspection equipment business unit “mie business unit” of vistec semiconductor systems for net cash consideration of approximately 1414 million the acquired mie business unit is a provider of mask registration measurement tools scanning electron microscope “sem” based tools for mask critical dimension measurement and macro defect inspection systems our financial results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 also included significant charges associated with impairment of goodwill purchased intangible assets and other longlived assets as well as restructuring programs 

the results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 reflected the culmination of a period of improved conditions in the semiconductor industry that began with the industry recovery in the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 while the semiconductor market and overall economic conditions had started to weaken throughout the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 our backlog position driven by demand from dynamic random access memory dram and flash memory chip manufacturers enabled us to generate strong revenue gross margin and net income in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 we completed the acquisition of icos vision systems corporation for net cash consideration of approximately 4888 million primarily to expand our product portfolio in semiconductor packaging inspection and to gain entry into the solar cell inspection and hbled inspection markets 

revenues and gross margin 

 

 product revenues 

product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 as a result of increased capital spending by customers for both technology and capacity related investments of process control equipment in response to strong semiconductor electronics end market demand 

  

new semiconductor manufacturing products targeted towards the most advanced production nodes were significant contributors to this increase in revenue as customers added advanced production capacity particularly those serving the foundry market these factors contributed to an increase in the number of tools that we sold during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 as compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 the increase in tool sales over our prior fiscal year was primarily driven by an increase in our sales of defect inspection equipment 

product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 as a result of a reduction in capital spending by our customers due to the weakness in the semiconductor industry and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment which resulted in customers delaying their purchases and installations of our products the decline in revenues reflected the slowdown in worldwide demand for semiconductor equipment as semiconductor manufacturers reduced capital spending and conserved cash in response to their business environment even as their need for more precise diagnostics capabilities increased with technological advances the weak macroeconomic and credit environments during the year adversely impacted the profitability of our customers their access to capital and their capital spending 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 two customers taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and intel corporation each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 two customers intel corporation and samsung electronics co ltd accounted for more than 10 of total revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 no customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenues as of june 30 2010 two customers samsung electronics co ltd and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited each accounted for more than 10 of net accounts receivable as of june 30 2009 two customers taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and intel corporation each accounted for more than 10 of net accounts receivable 

service revenues 

service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period the amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems service revenues increased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 as the increase in wafer processing activity by semiconductor manufacturing customers drove higher system utilization of our previously installed equipment this higher utilization level led to an increase in demand for service service revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 as customers idled their underutilized production equipment in response to the weakness in the semiconductor industry and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment 

revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows in thousands 

 

   

a significant portion of our revenues continue to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that will continue to be the case 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products our gross margin percentage increased to 55 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 from 43 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 primarily due to demand for new high value products significant volume efficiencies in manufacturing operations worldwide lower inventory obsolescence as well as a lower overall manufacturing cost structure as a result of our outsourcing and globalization initiatives in addition productivity improvements resulting from better utilization of field service resources contributed to the gross margin improvement 

our gross margin percentage decreased to 43 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 from 55 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 primarily due to lower product and service revenues higher intangible assets amortization expense as a result of our acquisitions of icos and the mie business unit decreased manufacturing capacity utilization and excess inventory writedowns 

engineering research and development “rd” 

 

 rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 even as we continued significant investments in product research and development the decrease during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 was primarily attributable to cost reduction activities initiated during fiscal year ended june 30 2009 the benefits of which were fully realized in the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 in addition no inprocess rd expense associated with acquisitions that we completed during that year was recorded during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to 86 million of inprocess rd expense recorded during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 furthermore development material costs and consulting services related to rd product development decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 as certain significant new products completed the product development cycle during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 and came to market in the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 the following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

 

  

  

  

  

   

rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced employeerelated expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken as well as reduced engineering material costs during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 these decreases were partially offset by additional rd spending as a result of our acquisitions of icos and the mie business unit the following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

 

  

  

  

  

 during the fiscal years ended june 30 2009 and 2008 we expensed iprd of 86 million and 227 million respectively upon the completion of the acquisitions during the applicable fiscal year in connection with acquired intellectual property for which as of the acquisition date technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed the fair value of the purchased iprd was determined using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value future cash flows were estimated taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology relevant market sizes and industry trends we determined a discount rate for each project based on the relative risks inherent in the project’s development horizon the estimated costs of development and the level of technological change in the project and the industry among other factors iprd was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed the development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility rapidly changing customer markets uncertain standards for new products and significant competitive threats the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning designing experimenting and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations including functionality and technical requirements 

rd expenses include the benefit of 137 million 217 million and 204 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended june 30 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants we expect our rd expenses to increase with increases in our business activity levels as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes 

  

selling general and administrative “sga” 

 

 sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 primarily due to cost reduction activities initiated during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 the benefits of which were fully realized in the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 in addition 29 million of bad debt recovery was recorded during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to 232 million of bad debt expense recorded during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 the following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

 

  

  

  

 sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 primarily due to lower expenses related to the shareholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices and reduced employeerelated expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken which are partially offset by additional sga spending and higher intangible assets amortization expense as a result of our acquisitions of icos and the mie business unit additional bad debt expense and lower gain on sale of real estate assets the following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

 

  

  

  

  

 impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

for the three months ended december 31 2009 we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit and concluded that there was no impairment as of december 31 2009 as of december 31 2009 our assessment indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their estimated 

  

carrying values and therefore goodwill in the reporting units was not impaired there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 

for the three months ended december 31 2008 we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit and concluded that as of december 31 2008 the carrying value of our metrology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value as a result of the global economic downturn reductions to our revenue and operating forecasts and a significant reduction in our market capitalization we determined that the goodwill related to our metrology reporting unit was fully impaired as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2721 million during the three months ended december 31 2008 

as a result of the aforementioned impairment indicators for the three months ended december 31 2008 and in accordance with the authoritative guidance on impairment of longlived assets we performed an analysis utilizing discounted future cash flows related to the longlived and intangible assets to determine the fair value of each of our asset groups based on the assessment we recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of 1628 million related to existing technology patents customer relationships and trademarks as well as an additional 20 million impairment charge related to longlived assets during the three months ended december 31 2008 

restructuring charges 

in march 2009 we announced a plan to further reduce our global workforce by approximately 10 which followed our announcement in november 2008 of a global workforce reduction of approximately 15 we have undertaken a number of cost reduction activities including these workforce reductions in an effort to lower our quarterly operating expense run rate the program in the united states is accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance related to compensation for nonretirement postemployment benefits  whereas the programs in the international locations are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for contingencies during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 we recorded a 45 million net restructuring charge of which 22 million was recorded to costs of revenues 04 million to engineering research and development expense and 19 million to selling general and administrative expense these charges represent the estimated minimum liability associated with expected termination benefits to be provided to employees 

the following table shows the activity primarily related to severance and benefits expense for the fiscal years ended june 30 2010 and 2009 

 

 substantially all of the remaining accrued restructuring balance as of june 30 2010 related to our workforce reductions is expected to be paid out by the end of calendar year 2010 

interest income and other net 

 

   

interest income and other net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities as well as gains or losses recorded upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts interest income and other net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 remained flat the decrease in interest income and other net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 was primarily the result of lower interest income from our investment and cash portfolio due to lower market interest rates as well as lower foreign currency transaction gain 

interest expense in the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 remained flat the increase in interest expense in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 was primarily due to additional interest expense as a result of the issuance of 750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

provision for income taxes 

the following table provides details of income taxes 

 

 tax expense has decreased during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 due to a yearoveryear increase in the proportion of our income earned outside the united states in countries with lower income tax rates 

we incurred 120 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 due to shortfalls from employee stock activity windfall tax benefits arise when a company’s tax deduction for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity a shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value shortfalls are recorded as decreases to capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes 

we incurred 381 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 due to a reduction in noncurrent deferred tax assets as a result of the adoption of california budget legislation signed on february 20 2009 which will allow a taxpayer to elect an alternative method to attribute taxable income to california for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2011 we expect to make the election to use the alternative method to attribute taxable income to california for our fiscal year ending june 30 2012 the expense included a reduction in noncurrent deferred tax assets of 97 million and a 284 million valuation allowance on excess california research and development credits that we believe will not be utilized due to the effect of the lower apportionment rate 

tax expense was also increased during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 due to a goodwill impairment charge of 2770 million related to certain business units which was nondeductible for tax purposes 

we incurred 529 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 due to the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy the incremental us tax expense was a result of an intercompany licensing agreement related to the migration of manufacturing to singapore 

the additional tax expense was partially offset by a tax benefit of 144 million during the year ended june 30 2008 that we realized due to the revision of prior year cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered to be permanently reinvested outside the united states 

  

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income the domestic manufacturing deduction nontaxable or nondeductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

for the fiscal year ending june 30 2011 cumulative shortfalls from employee stock activity may continue to exceed cumulative windfalls from employee stock activity and we may therefore report higher provision for income taxes as a result because we cannot determine all of the factors that will enter into our income tax expense computation for the fiscal year ended june 30 2011 we cannot currently estimate this impact on our tax rate for the next fiscal year 

in the normal course of business we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we are under united states federal income tax examination for the fiscal years ended june 30 2007 through june 30 2009 which represents all years for which tax returns have been filed and the statute of limitations has not expired we are subject to state income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 we are also subject to examinations in major foreign jurisdictions including japan israel and singapore for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 and are currently under tax examinations in various other foreign tax jurisdictions it is possible that certain examinations may be concluded in the next twelve months we believe it is possible that we may recognize up to 36 million of our existing unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months as a result of the lapse of statutes of limitations and the resolution of agreements with various foreign tax authorities 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 at june 30 2010 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 15 billion an increase of 204 million from june 30 2009 we have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations cash provided by operating activities was 448 million and 196 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 from 196 million to 448 million primarily as a result of the following key factors 

 

  

  

  

 cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 declined compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 from 485 million to 228 million primarily as a result of the following key factors 

 

  

  

 cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 declined compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 from 299 million to 216 million as a result of lower common stock repurchases we repurchased 136 million of our common stock during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 as compared to 227 million in stock repurchases during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 from 663 million to 196 million primarily as a result of the following key factors 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

cash flow from investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 declined compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 from 58 million of cash provided by investing activities to 485 million of cash used in investing activities primarily as a result of the following key factors 

 

  

  

  

 cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 declined compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 from 319 million to 299 million as a result of lower common stock repurchases largely offset by cash proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt we repurchased 227 million of our common stock during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 as compared to 11 billion in stock repurchases during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we announced plans to reduce our global workforce by approximately 15 and 10 in november 2008 and march 2009 respectively we recorded 45 million and 387 million in net restructuring charges during the fiscal years ended june 30 2010 and 2009 respectively as of june 30 2010 we have paid out approximately 441 million in restructuring payments the remaining balance will be paid out by the end of calendar year 2010 

the total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended june 30 2010 2009 and 2008 was 1024 million 1021 million and 1085 million respectively 

the shares repurchased under our share repurchase program have decreased our basic and diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding the decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and in connection with stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan in october 2008 we suspended our stock repurchase program and we subsequently restarted the program in february 2010 

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june 30 2010 

 

   

 

  we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition from time to time we will discount without recourse letters of credit “lcs” received from customers in payment for goods 

the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lcs and related discounting fees paid during the years ended june 30 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

  

 we maintain guarantee arrangements of 167 million in various locations to fund customs guarantees for vat and lc needs of our subsidiaries in europe and asia approximately 144 million was outstanding under these arrangements as of june 30 2010 

we maintain certain purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecast timehorizon can vary among different suppliers we estimate our purchase commitments as of june 30 2010 to be approximately 3381 million most of which is due within the next 12 months actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition the amounts paid under these arrangements may change in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 

we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly nonstandard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

working capital increased to 21 billion as of june 30 2010 compared to 19 billion as of june 30 2009 this increase is primarily due to cash generated from operations offset by cash payments for the share repurchase program cash payments of dividends to stockholders and purchases of fixed assets as of june 30 2010 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 15 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 

  

our investment portfolio included auction rate securities which are investments with contractual maturities generally between 20 to 30 years they are typically issued in the form of municipal bonds preferred stock a pool of student loans or collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are reset the reset typically occurs every seven to fortynine days through an auction process at the end of each reset period investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par the auction rate securities held by us are backed by student loans and are collateralized insured and guaranteed by the united states federal department of education in addition all auction rate securities held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa in february 2008 auctions failed for approximately 482 million in par value of municipal auction rate securities that we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders these failures are not believed to be a credit issue but rather caused by a lack of liquidity the funds associated with these failed auctions may not be accessible until the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures 

by letter dated august 8 2008 we received notification from ubs ag “ubs” in connection with a settlement entered into between ubs and certain regulatory agencies offering to repurchase all of our auction rate security holdings at par value we formally accepted the settlement offer and entered into a repurchase agreement “agreement” with ubs on november 11 2008 “acceptance date” by accepting the agreement we 1 received the right “put option” to sell our auction rate securities at par value to ubs between june 30 2010 and june 30 2012 and 2 gave ubs the right to purchase the auction rate securities from us any time after the acceptance date as long as we receive the par value as of june 30 2009 we had 407 million par value of auction rate securities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2010 239 million of the auction rate securities were called at par by the issuers the put option was exercised on june 30 2010 to sell the remaining auction rate securities of 168 million at par value and was subsequently settled as of june 30 2010 those remaining auction rate securities that had been sold but had not yet been settled as of such date are included in marketable securities and valued at par 

we accounted for the put option as a freestanding financial instrument and during the three months ended december 31 2008 we made an election to transfer these auction rate securities from available for sale to trading securities 

in april 2008 we issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of 690 senior unsecured longterm debt due in 2018 with an effective interest rate of 700 the discount on the debt amounted to 54 million and is being amortized over the life of the debt using the straightline method as opposed to the interest method due to immateriality interest is payable semiannually on november 1 and may 1 the debt indenture includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions subject to significant allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted we are in compliance with all of our covenants as at june 30 2010 

our credit ratings and outlooks as of july 22 2010 are summarized below 

 

 factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under our foreign currency risk management strategy we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates this financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management 

  

program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months see note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description our outstanding hedge contracts with maximum maturity of 18 months were as follows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of june 30 2010 actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2010 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 10 billion excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 from levels as of june 30 2010 the fair value of the portfolio would decline by 13 million 

as of june 30 2010 we had net forward and option contracts to sell 389 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2010 the us dollar equivalent would have been 444 million a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 215 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows 

in april 2008 we issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of 690 senior unsecured notes due in 2018 the fair market value of longterm fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise at june 30 2010 the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were 7457 million and 8344 million respectively at june 30 2009 the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were 7452 million and 7020 million respectively

attached as exhibits to this report are certifications of the ceo and cfo which are required in accordance with rule 13a14 of the exchange act this controls and procedures section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented 

definition of disclosure controls 

disclosure controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports filed under the exchange act such as this report is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure the company’s disclosure controls include components of its internal control over financial reporting which consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us to the extent that components of the company’s internal control over financial reporting are included within its disclosure controls they are included in the scope of the company’s annual controls evaluation 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the ceo and cfo the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation the company’s management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2010 

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2010 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

industry 

general background 

the semiconductor or chip industry is klatencor’s core focus the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is six eight or twelve inches in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers and polished to a mirror finish 

  

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper “interconnect” structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when all of the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality the wafer is then cut into individual devices and those chips that passed functional testing are packaged final testing is performed on all packaged chips 

current trends 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trends such as a specific design rule shrink in today’s market driven by consumer demand for lowcost electronic goods from smart phones and mp3 players to laptops and portable devices the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in bringing a multitude of new process technologies into production at the same time some requiring new substrate and film materials new geometries and advanced lithography techniques 

while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected their adoption into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects while device performance characteristics namely speed capacity or power management become more sensitive to such parameters as linewidth and film thickness variation new process materials such as highk dielectrics silicononinsulator “soi” wafers and immersion lithographycapable photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the cost and performance requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 5 billion substantially more than previous generation facilities in addition recent global economic conditions have delayed new fab builds upgrades and expansions as a result chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment 

by developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment “roi” once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume our tools help ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution in addition the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules coupled with new materials and device innovation has increased inprocess variability which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling 

with our broad portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ nextgeneration products including those required for the 32nm chip generation and beyond 

  

our process control and yield acceleration solutions 

accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to highvolume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product klatencor systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer reticle and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems the ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes this allows them to increase their yield of highperformance parts and deliver their products to market ahead of their competitors—thus maximizing their profit

customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout the united states europe asiapacific and japan staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers from each of these regions for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 two customers intel corporation and samsung electronics co ltd accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues in each of the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 and 2007 no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues 

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are aimed at building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility that are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier our revenues are derived primarily from product sales mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in the united states europe asiapacific and japan we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to fully meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2009 we employed approximately 2050 sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of whollyowned subsidiaries or branches in other countries including belgium china france germany hong kong india israel italy japan malaysia singapore south korea taiwan thailand and the united kingdom international revenues accounted for approximately 76 79 and 76 of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended june 30 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 17 “segment reporting and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country the revenues from our international business may also be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in nondollar product sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

  

backlog 

our backlog for system shipments and associated warranty totaled 332 million and 715 million as of june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively and includes sales orders where written customer requests have been received and the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months we make backlog adjustments for backlog obtained from acquired companies cancellations customer delivery date changes and currency adjustments orders for service contracts and unreleased products are excluded from backlog all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer often with limited or no penalties 

because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods our backlog is not subject to our normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our basic financial statements the concept of backlog is not defined in the accounting literature making comparisons between periods and with other companies difficult and potentially misleading 

research and development 

the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs as part of our customer relationships we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby our customers offset certain of our research and development costs as of june 30 2009 we employed approximately 1150 research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during fiscal year 2009 involved development of process control and yield management equipment for sub65nm processing for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

in order to make continuing developments in the semiconductor industry we are committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development new product introductions may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in san jose and milpitas california with additional significant operations in israel singapore belgium germany and china as of june 30 2009 we employed approximately 700 manufacturing personnel 

  

many of the parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are standard commercial products although certain parts are made to our specifications we use numerous vendors to supply parts for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts by monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers and by ensuring adequate inventories of key parts are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have such as applied materials inc and hitachi electronics engineering co ltd we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability installed base and technical service and support we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions and alliances 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition additional information regarding our business combination during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 can be found in note 5 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 

  

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

employees 

as of june 30 2009 we employed approximately 4900 people none of our employees are represented by a labor union however our employees in france pursuant to french industrial relations law and in the german operations of our acquired mie business unit are represented by employee work councils we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees

 item 1a risk factors tableend a description of factors that could materially affect our business financial condition or operating results is provided below 

risks associated with our industry and market conditions 

the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict the cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate is largely a function of our customers’ capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization consumer demand for products inventory levels and our customers’ access to capital this cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels in the current environment our ability to accurately predict our future operating results is particularly limited during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in or cancellation or delay of orders which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues as was experienced during fiscal year 2009 we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond or if our attempts to respond such as the global workforce reductions and costreduction efforts that we announced in november 2008 and march 2009 fail to accomplish our intended results then our business could be seriously harmed furthermore any workforce reductions and costreduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

in addition the semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time these changes currently or in the future may include the increasing cost of building and operating fabrication facilities and the impact of such increases on our customers’ investment decisions the variability of future growth rates in the semiconductor and related industries the everincreasing cost and complexity involved in the adoption by our customers of technology advances and the potential impact that may have on their rate of adoption pricing trends in the endmarkets for consumer electronics and other products which places a growing emphasis on our customers’ cost of ownership overall changes in capital spending patterns by our customers and demand by semiconductor manufacturers for shorter cycle times for developing manufacturing and installing capital equipment if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 

we are exposed to risks associated with the current weakened condition of the financial markets and the global economy 

the recent severe tightening of the credit markets turmoil in the financial markets and weakening of the global economy have contributed to slowdowns in the industries in which we operate which slowdowns are likely to worsen if these economic conditions are prolonged or deteriorate further 

  

the markets for semiconductors and therefore our business are ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending which in the recent economic slowdown has caused our customers to decrease cancel or delay their equipment and service orders from us in addition the recent tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit have made it more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell reduced demand combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing or the unavailability of such financing has adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results and our operating results and financial condition may be further adversely impacted if the current economic conditions persist 

in addition a further decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities auction rate securities money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and where applicable credit ratings and government guarantees of the underlying investments a further decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market values of our investments and their liquidity if the market value of such investments were to decline or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the difficult macroeconomic environment our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets loss of competitive position could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our business 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we recorded material restructuring charges of 387 million related to our global workforce reduction large excess inventory writeoffs of 856 million and material impairment charges of 4467 million related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets if the current challenging economic conditions persist we may implement additional costreduction actions which would require us to take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to among other things employee terminations or exit costs we may also be required to write off additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory experience further declines and such additional writeoffs could constitute material charges 

as noted above we recorded a material charge during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for 

  

impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using the straightline method and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for impairment or disposal of longlived assets  the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to calculate the amount of such impairment charge could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge 

any such additional material charges whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements 

we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 

our customer base particularly in the semiconductor industry historically has been and is becoming increasingly highly concentrated in this environment orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales in addition the mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year if customers do not place orders or they delay or cancel orders we may not be able to replace the business furthermore because our products are configured to customer specifications any changes delays or cancellations of orders may result in significant nonrecoverable costs major customers may also seek and on occasion receive pricing payment intellectual propertyrelated or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us also certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes experienced management changes or have outsourced manufacturing activities any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions in the current challenging economic environment we are exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial viability of certain of our customers for instance during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by 232 million from 123 million at june 30 2008 for potential losses relating to a heightened risk of nonpayment of accounts receivable by customers facing financial difficulty to the extent our customers experience liquidity issues we may be required to incur additional bad debt expense with respect to receivables owed to us by those customers in addition customers with liquidity issues may be forced to discontinue operations or may be acquired by one of our customers and in either case such event would have the effect of further consolidating our customer base these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

a majority of our annual revenue is derived from outside the united states and we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue a protracted economic slowdown in any of the countries in which we do business may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

a majority of our annual revenue is derived from outside the united states and we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue our international revenue and operations are affected by economic conditions specific to each country and region because of our significant dependence on international revenue a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business could negatively affect our operating results managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents challenges associated with among other things cultural diversity and organizational alignment moreover each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period periodic local or international economic downturns trade balance issues tariffs or other trade barriers political instability legal or regulatory changes or terrorism in regions where we have operations or where we do business along with fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our business and results of operations although we attempt to manage nearterm currency risks through the use of hedging instruments there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate 

  

risks related to our business 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions for example the size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink and the industry is currently transitioning to the use of new materials and innovative fab processes while we expect these trends will increase our customers’ reliance on diagnostic products such as ours we cannot be sure that these trends will directly improve our business these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards to develop and introduce new products that successfully address changing customer needs to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner 

in this environment we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance features and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenue from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

our business would be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers in addition if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations which is a heightened risk during the current economic downturn that would affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states with additional operations in israel singapore belgium germany and china operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism fire earthquake energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers we cannot ensure that alternate production capacity would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if it were available it could be obtained on favorable terms 

  

as part of the costcutting actions that we have recently announced we are currently in the process of consolidating several of our operating facilities during fiscal year 2009 and in previous years our operations in california have been distributed among several locations including milpitas san jose fremont and santa clara however upon completion of our current consolidation efforts our california operations will be primarily centralized in our milpitas facility the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described in the preceding paragraph such as acts of war or terrorism earthquakes fires or other natural disasters if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation and logistics management of spare parts to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered or our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers due to events such as regional economic business environmental or political events information technology system failures or military actions could adversely impact our operations and our ability to ship products manage our product inventory or record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business in addition we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product research and development projects the termination of any such collaboration or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration could significantly impair our research and development efforts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

  

we might be involved in intellectual property disputes or other intellectual property infringement claims that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information in addition we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties litigation tends to be expensive and requires significant management time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of operations or business if we lose or have to settle a case on significantly adverse terms our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms or the instigation of litigation or other administrative proceedings could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future our business and operations could be harmed 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current shareholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected in addition we may lose key employees of the acquired companies as a result risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 at times we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary highly sensitive information the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements is becoming increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and in the future are expected to continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism which affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business increased international political instability in various parts of the world disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations such continuing instability could cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate this same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we self insure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain other risks are uninsurable or are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations most of which are conducted in california an area highly susceptible to earthquakes it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products most of which are also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would 

  

be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we self insure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also selfinsured either based on a similar costbenefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices or changes in interpretations of such standards practices or rules can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and may occur in the future changes to or revised interpretations of existing tax or accounting rules or the questioning of current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

for example the adoption of sfas no 123r sharebased payment which required us to measure all employee stockbased compensation awards using a fair value method beginning in fiscal year 2006 and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements has had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

a change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in sharebased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws for example proposals for fundamental us international tax reform such as the recent proposal by president obama’s administration if enacted changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes a change in our effective tax rate can adversely impact our results from operations 

we are exposed to various risks related to the legal and regulatory environments in which we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to compliance with new existing different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust and export control regulations for example we are subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with our global business operations including regulations related to the development manufacture and use of our products recycling and disposal of materials used in our products or in producing our products the operation of our facilities and the use of our real property our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws rules or regulations or changes to existing laws rules or regulations including changes that result in inconsistent or conflicting laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our reported financial results or our ability to conduct our business 

in addition we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment contracts product performance product liability antitrust environmental regulations securities unfair competition and other matters in addition to proceedings and claims related to intellectual property matters which are separately discussed elsewhere in this item 1a these legal proceedings and claims regardless of 

  

their merit may be timeconsuming and expensive to prosecute or defend divert management’s attention and resources andor inhibit our ability to sell our products there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims which could adversely affect our operating results financial condition and our ability to operate our business 

we are also exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies both domestically and internationally under the terms of these government grants the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur directly and indirectly in connection with such programs any such audit could result in modifications to or even termination of the applicable government funding program for example if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program those costs would not be reimbursed and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded we do not know the outcome of any future audits any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties financial or otherwise termination of funding programs suspension of payments fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency any of which could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and our ability to operate our business 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the euro and the japanese yen we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with various financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected furthermore if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge we may experience material financial losses 

we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements 

we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions any of which may prove not to be financially viable if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables however by entering into these arrangements and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services we are exposed to additional risks if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

there are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness 

as of june 30 2009 we had 750 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness represented by our senior notes that will mature in 2018 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and the other risk factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities 

  

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of our senior notes we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of the senior notes our ability to repurchase the senior notes in such event may be limited by law by the indenture associated with the senior notes or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time if we fail to repurchase the senior notes as required by the indenture it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings in addition we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock 

our investment portfolio consists of both corporate and government securities that have a maximum effective maturity of 10 years the longer the duration of these securities the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields as yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates and bond yields 

auction rate securities backed by student loans which are collateralized insured and guaranteed by the united states federal department of education are also included in our investment portfolio due to the current illiquidity in the auction rate security market the funds associated with these failed auctions may not be accessible until the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures although we believe our auction rate securities continue to represent sound investments due to the aaaaaa credit ratings of the underlying investments we may be forced to sell some of our auction rate securities portfolio under illiquid market conditions which could result in our recognizing a loss on such sales 

in august 2008 ubs ag entered into a settlement in principle with the sec and various state regulatory agencies to restore liquidity to all clients holding auction rate securities per the settlement ubs has agreed to offer certain clients the option to redeem all of their auction rate securities at par no loss from ubs between june 30 2010 and june 30 2012 and we formally accepted this offer and entered into a repurchase agreement with ubs on november 11 2008 however ubs has expressly disclaimed any assurance that it will have enough financial resources necessary to perform its obligations under the agreement if we elect to retain our auction rate securities in reliance upon that offer with the intent of participating in the offer but ubs is unable to satisfy its obligations under the offer at the applicable time we may be required to sell the auction rate securities at that time at a significant loss or hold the auction rate securities until they may be sold which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results and financial condition 

in addition the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets our operating results or other performance metrics or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies 

  

we are exposed to risks related to our indemnification of third parties and the performance of our products 

from time to time in the normal course of business we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships including customers and lessors with respect to certain matters we have agreed under certain conditions to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties or other claims made against certain parties we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations or subject to potential liability arising from our customers’ involvements in legal disputes in addition notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations whether or not asserted due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim our business financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims regardless of their merit or outcomes 

we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues our products and production processes are extremely complex and thus could contain unexpected product defects especially when products are first introduced unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us including increased service or warranty costs providing product replacements for or modifications to defective products litigation related to defective products product recalls or product writeoffs or disposal costs these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business financial condition and operating results in addition our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operation our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations 

our global operations are linked by information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications despite our implementation of network security measures our tools and servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems and tools located at customer sites or could be subject to system failures or malfunctions for other reasons any such event could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we may experience difficulties with our customer relationship management “crm” system enterprise resource planning “erp” system or other it systems system failure or malfunctioning may result in a disruption of operations or the inability to process transactions and this could adversely affect our financial results  

we may experience difficulties with our recently implemented crm system that could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of the results of our consolidated operations our financial position and cash flows system failure or malfunctioning could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our results of operations financial position and cash flows any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems whether in connection with the regular operation of such systems or as a result of the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems could also adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the 

  

evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 if we encounter unforeseen problems with regard to our crm system erp system or other systems our business could be adversely affected 

risks related to the restatement of our prior financial results 

we have been named as a party to a number of shareholder derivative and class action lawsuits relating to our historical stock option practices and we may be named in additional lawsuits in the future this litigation has been and continues to be time consuming and expensive and could result in the payment of significant judgments and settlements which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements a number of derivative actions were filed against certain of our current and former directors and officers purporting to assert claims on the company’s behalf in addition a number of securities class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers seeking damages related to our historical stock option practices and the resulting investigation inquiries and restatements there may be additional lawsuits or other legal proceedings of this nature filed in the future such as claims by former officers and employees in connection with their stock options employment terminations and other matters we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits nor can we predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve these lawsuits if these lawsuits become time consuming and expensive or if there are unfavorable outcomes in any of these cases there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our insurance coverage will not cover our total liabilities and expenses in these lawsuits in part because we have a significant deductible on certain aspects of the coverage in addition subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government actions we currently hold insurance policies for the benefit of our directors and officers although our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in some or all of these matters furthermore the insurers may seek to deny or limit coverage in some or all of these matters in which case we may have to selffund all or a substantial portion of our indemnification obligations 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered 

in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws if we were to violate any such law we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the special committee investigation of our historical stock option practices and the resulting restatements have been time consuming and expensive and have had a material adverse effect on us 

the special committee investigation and the resulting restatement activities have required us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses the period of time that will be necessary to resolve these matters is uncertain and these matters could require significant additional attention and resources

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend government inquiries and sec settlement relating to historical stock option practices 

on may 23 2006 we received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office “usao” requesting information relating to our past stock option grants and related accounting matters also on may 23 2006 we received a letter from the sec making an informal inquiry and request for information on the same subject matters we learned on february 2 2007 that the sec had opened a formal investigation into these matters we cooperated fully with the sec investigation on july 25 2007 we announced that we had reached a settlement with the sec by consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of the reporting books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws the settlement resolves completely the sec investigation into our historical stock option granting practices we were not charged by the sec with fraud nor were we required to pay any civil penalty fine or money damages as part of the settlement on july 31 2008 the usao informed us that it had closed its investigation and had determined not to take any action against us both the sec and usao investigations with respect to us are now closed 

we have also responded to inquiries from the us department of labor “dol” which conducted an examination of our 401k savings plan prompted by our stock option issues we cooperated fully with this examination and the dol has advised us that it has closed its examination with no further action subject to confirmation of resolution of any potential claims on behalf of our 401k savings plan in connection with its investments in our stock we believe there is no basis for any such claims however an independent fiduciary appointed to act in the best interests of our 401k savings plan has elected to participate in the previously announced settlement of the shareholder class action of all potential nonerisa claims described below which will involve no additional cost to the company and we have agreed to enter into a separate settlement with the independent fiduciary of any and all potential erisa claims in which we denied all liability and paid our 401k savings plan a total of 25000 as a result the dol examination has been concluded without any material adverse consequence to us in addition the internal revenue service conducted an audit covering calendar year 2006 related to our historical stock option practices which was concluded in july 2008 with a payment by us of 01 million there can be no assurance that other inquiries investigations or actions will not be started by other united states federal or state regulatory agencies or by foreign governmental agencies 

shareholder derivative litigation relating to historical stock option practices 

beginning on may 22 2006 several persons and entities identifying themselves as shareholders of klatencor filed derivative actions purporting to assert claims on behalf of and in the name of the company against several of our current and former directors and officers relating to our accounting for stock options issued from 1994 to the present the complaints in these actions allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties and other obligations to us and violated state and federal securities laws in connection with our historical stock option granting process our accounting for past stock options and historical sales of stock by the 

  

individual defendants three substantially similar actions are pending one in the us district court for the northern district of california the “federal derivative action” which consists of three separate lawsuits consolidated into one action one in the california superior court for santa clara county and one in the delaware chancery court 

the plaintiffs in the derivative actions have asserted claims for violations of sections 10b including rule 10b5 thereunder 14a and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 unjust enrichment breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting such breach negligence misappropriation of information abuse of control gross mismanagement waste of corporate assets breach of contract constructive fraud rescission and violations of california corporations code section 25402 as well as a claim for an accounting of all stock option grants made to the named defendants klatencor is named as a nominal defendant in these actions on behalf of klatencor the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary and other relief against the named defendants the plaintiffs are james ziolkowski mark ziering alaska electrical pension fund jeffrey rabin and benjamin langford the individual named defendants are current directors and officers edward w barnholt robert t bond stephen p kaufman and richard p wallace and former directors and officers h raymond bingham robert j boehlke leo chamberlain gary e dickerson richard j elkus jr dennis j fortino jeffrey l hall john h kispert kenneth levy michael e marks stuart j nichols arthur p schnitzer kenneth l schroeder jon d tompkins and lida urbanek current director david c wang and former director dean o morton were originally named as defendants in one of the derivative actions filed in the us district court for the northern district of california but were dropped as named defendants as of december 22 2006 upon the filing of a consolidated complaint in that action 

the derivative actions are at an early procedural stage the defendants are not yet required to respond to the complaints in the actions our board of directors appointed a special litigation committee “slc” composed solely of independent directors to conduct an independent investigation of the claims asserted in the derivative actions and to determine our position with respect to those claims on march 25 2008 the slc filed a motion to terminate the federal derivative action and to approve certain settlements with gary e dickerson kenneth levy kenneth schroeder and jon d tompkins related to the claims brought against them in connection with the derivative actions the court denied the motion to terminate and to approve the settlements on december 12 2008 the slc filed an appeal and petition for writ of mandate challenging that decision to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit which dismissed the appeal on may 8 2009 and denied the petition for writ of mandate on july 10 2009 as a result the derivative actions remain ongoing the defendants have not yet responded to the complaint in the federal derivative action and will not be required to do so until after the plaintiff has had an opportunity to amend the complaint the parties are currently participating in a mediation of the derivative claims in the federal derivative action no defendant is yet required to answer the complaints in the state court derivative actions in the california superior court for santa clara county and the delaware chancery court response dates in the california superior court action have been stayed until responses are due in the federal derivative action it is not known whether the california superior court action will remain stayed after that time on march 17 2009 the delaware chancery court issued an order staying the delaware action so that the litigation of the issues can be confined to the prior federal derivative action plaintiff sought leave to appeal the stay decision which was denied by the chancery court on april 14 2009 plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the delaware supreme court seeking to overturn the chancery court’s denial of the application to appeal which the delaware supreme court denied on april 27 2009 

we cannot predict whether these derivative actions are likely to result in any material recovery by or expense to us 

shareholder class action litigation relating to historical stock option practices 

klatencor and various of our current and former directors and officers were named as defendants in putative securities class action filed on june 29 2006 in the us district court for the northern district of california two similar actions were filed later in the same court and all three cases were consolidated into a 

  

single action on september 26 2008 judge charles breyer of the northern district granted final approval of a settlement resolving all class claims and dismissing with prejudice all claims brought by the consolidated action the class action had alleged material misrepresentations in our sec filings and public statements and brought claims under section 10b and rule 10b5 thereunder section 14a section 20a and section 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as a result of the company’s past stock option grants and related accounting and reporting the settlement resolved all claims against all defendants who were klatencor edward w barnholt h raymond bingham robert t bond gary e dickerson richard j elkus jr jeffrey l hall stephen p kaufman john h kispert kenneth levy michael e marks stuart j nichols kenneth l schroeder jon d tompkins lida urbanek and richard p wallace 

we made a payment of 650 million to the settlement class as a term of the courtapproved settlement during the three months ended september 30 2008 which provides a full release of klatencor and the other named defendants in connection with the allegations raised in the lawsuit we had reached an agreement in principle to resolve the action prior to december 31 2007 and therefore an amount of 650 million was accrued by a charge to selling general and administrative expenses during the three months ended december 31 2007 

another plaintiff chris crimi filed a putative class action complaint in the superior court of the state of california for the county of santa clara on september 4 2007 against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers the plaintiff sought to represent a class consisting of persons who held klatencor common stock between september 20 2002 and september 27 2006 originally alleging causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and rescission based on alleged misstatements and omissions in our sec filings concerning our past stock option grants and seeking unspecified damages based upon purported dilution of our stock injunctive relief and rescission the plaintiff named us edward w barnholt h raymond bingham robert t bond richard j elkus jr stephen p kaufman kenneth levy michael e marks dean o morton kenneth l schroeder jon d tompkins and richard p wallace as defendants in the action we filed a demurrer to the complaint which was sustained and then removed the case to the us district court for the northern district of california upon plaintiff’s filing an amended complaint we then filed a motion to dismiss the action in the northern district of california which was granted in part with the remaining claims being remanded back to the california superior court on september 12 2008 we filed a demurrer to plaintiff’s second amended complaint and plaintiff responded by agreeing to dismiss the action with prejudice bringing an end to this action 

as part of a derivative lawsuit filed in the delaware chancery court on july 21 2006 a plaintiff claiming to be a klatencor shareholder also asserted a separate putative class action claim against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers alleging that shareholders incurred damage due to purported dilution of klatencor common stock resulting from historical stock option granting practices on march 17 2009 the delaware chancery court dismissed the putative class action claim and stayed the derivative claims in the action plaintiff sought leave to appeal this decision which the chancery court denied on april 14 2009 plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the delaware supreme court seeking to overturn the chancery court’s denial of the application to appeal which the delaware supreme court denied on april 27 2009 

a final judgment has not been entered in the delaware chancery court action and we cannot predict the final outcome or estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse result however an unfavorable outcome in this litigation could have a material adverse impact upon the financial position results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the outcome occurs and in future periods 

litigation with former ceo kenneth schroeder 

on april 17 2009 kenneth schroeder our former chief executive officer served us with a lawsuit filed in the california superior court for santa clara county asserting various contract and tort claims in connection with our termination of mr schroeder and the cancellation of certain of his stock options and restricted stock units in october 2006 we filed a motion to compel arbitration of mr schroeder’s claims on june 15 2009 the 

  

california superior court issued an order compelling the arbitration of his claims and staying the state court action on july 27 2009 we have not yet responded to mr schroeder’s claims we deny having any liability and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against all claims asserted by mr schroeder 

at this early stage of the litigation we cannot predict the final outcome or estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse result however an unfavorable outcome in this litigation could have a material adverse impact upon the financial position results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the outcome occurs and in future periods 

indemnification obligations 

subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and ongoing government inquiry these obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws applicable contracts and delaware and california law the obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters we are currently paying or reimbursing legal expenses being incurred in connection with these matters by a number of our current and former directors officers and employees we are also paying defense costs to two former officers and employees facing sec civil actions to which we are not a party although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is theoretically unlimited we believe the fair value of this liability to the extent estimable is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings 

other legal matters 

we are named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial regardless of outcome we believe the amounts provided in our financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimated liabilities however because such matters are subject to many uncertainties the ultimate outcomes are not predictable and there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from the matters described above will not exceed the amounts reflected in our financial statements or will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed the company’s related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured we derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems spare parts and services we typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications under certain circumstances however we recognize revenue prior to written acceptance from the customer as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 14 16 and 14 of total revenues for the fiscal years ended june 30 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in revenue recognized without a written acceptance for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 is primarily driven by lower shipments of tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria at those customer fabs the increase in revenue recognized without a written acceptance for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 is primarily driven by 

  

increase in sales of systems with perfunctory installation primarily with respect to sales of products of companies that we have acquired during the past two fiscal years shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues 

tradein rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases we estimate the value of the tradein right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale this amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the tradein right or the expiration of the tradein right 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract services performed in absence of a contract such as consulting and training revenue are recognized when the related services are performed and collectability is reasonably assured 

the deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences 

software is incidental to our products as determined in accordance with aicpa statement of position “sop” no 972 software revenue recognition and emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 0305 applicability of sop 972 to nonsoftware deliverables in an arrangement containing morethanincidental software  we periodically review the software element of our systems in accordance with sop no 972 and eitf issue no 0305 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or market demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and reserves are recorded to state the demonstration units at their net realizable value we review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis 

we review and set standard costs semiannually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and wasted materials spoilage are recognized as current period charges 

we write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

warranty we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses utilizing actual service records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge we update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense more mature 

  

products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to take additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

stockbased compensation effective july 1 2005 we adopted the modified prospective transition method as provided by provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payment  sfas no 123r establishes accounting for stockbased awards exchanged for employee services accordingly the fair value of stockbased awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period the fair value is determined using a blackscholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units the blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the marketbased implied volatility from traded options of our common stock we believe that the implied volatility is reflective of market conditions prior to july 1 2005 we applied accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  

contingencies and litigation we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

goodwill and intangible assets as required by sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests annually or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using a fairvaluebased approach purchased technology patents trademarks and other intangible assets are presented at cost net of accumulated amortization intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis which approximates their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  see note 6 “goodwill and purchased intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination we conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit during the quarter ended december 31 2008 and concluded that the carrying value of our metrology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value our impairment evaluation of goodwill was based on comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates and operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others unanticipated changes in revenue gross margin longterm growth factor or discount rate could result in a material impact on the estimated fair values of our reporting units there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

  

income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities sfas no 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations as a result of the implementation of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no “fin” 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed within the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

we adopted fin 48 on july 1 2007 see note 12 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

valuation of marketable securities our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration of the investment the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

fair value measurements we adopted sfas no 157 fair value measurements  as of the beginning of fiscal year 2009 in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” sfas no 1572 which allows companies to elect a oneyear delay in applying sfas no 157 to certain fair value measurements primarily related to nonfinancial instruments we elected the delayed adoption date for the portions of sfas no 157 impacted by fsp sfas no 1572 sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for 

  

measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined under sfas no 157 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas no 157 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition see note 2 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements 

concurrently with our adoption of sfas no 157 we adopted sfas no 159 establishing the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities which permits entities to elect at specified election dates to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value see note 2 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements

executive summary 

klatencor corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries within our primary area of focus our comprehensive portfolio of products services software and expertise helps integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire wafer fabrication process – from research and development to final volume production in addition to the semiconductor industry our technologies serve a number of other industries including light emitting diode “led” data storage solar process development and control and general materials research 

our products and services are used by virtually every major wafer ic and photomask manufacturer in the world our revenues are driven largely by capital spending by our customers who operate in one or more of several key semiconductor markets including the memory foundry and logic markets our customers purchase our products either in response to the need to drive advances in process technologies or to ramp up production to satisfy demand from industries such as communication data processing consumer electronics automotive and aerospace we believe that over the longterm our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications as well as reduced cost which in turn will drive increased adoption of process control to reduce defectivity 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries we are subject to business cycles the timing length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict the industries we serve have historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand and manufacturing capacity we expect our customers’ technologyrelated capital spending on process control as differentiated from capacityrelated capital spending to increase over the long term as technology spending is driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes the transition to new materials new devices and circuit architecture new lithography challenges and fab process innovation however our ability to predict future capacityrelated capital spending by our customers is more limited as such spending is more closely connected to the unpredictable business cycles within their industries 

the demand for our products is generally affected by the profitability of our customers which is driven by capacity and market supply for their products while semiconductor content in communication data processing consumer electronics automotive and aerospace products continues to increase the global economic weakness has adversely impacted our customers that operate in those industries during the recent economic downturn the demand for our products has been adversely affected by lower profitability of our customers especially in the memory market as well as the weak macroeconomic and credit environment and its overall impact on capital spending 

our results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 reflect the impact of the global economic downturn and the resulting contraction in nearterm demand for semiconductor and nanoelectronic manufacturing equipment several of our customers have reduced their expenditures for production equipment in response to declining sales of their end products and resulting reductions in the utilization of existing manufacturing capacity although some customers continue to invest in equipment that is critical to technology development capacityrelated purchases have dropped to historically low levels this decline was also a result of difficulty experienced by some customers in obtaining financing for their capital expenditure plans we expect demand for semiconductor capital equipment to continue to remain weak until macroeconomic conditions improve we cannot predict the severity or duration of the global economic downturn or the resulting impact on our customer base or on our customers’ manufacturing strategies however as long as such conditions persist we expect that our product order levels and revenues will remain depressed 

we have taken significant steps to reduce our production levels and operating cost structure in alignment with expected nearterm order and revenue levels we have lowered our production volumes in response to anticipated nearterm business levels in an effort to size our operations to expected demand levels however our reduced scale of operations has led to increased inventoryrelated charges as our manufacturing inventory 

  

requirements decline and reduced manufacturing capacity utilization which has adversely impacted our results of operations declines in factory utilization by our customers have also resulted in lower service revenue levels and additional inventoryrelated charges due to the related decline in customer usage of our systems during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we announced global workforce reductions and other costreduction efforts aimed at lowering our operating expenses in response to the demand environment and we continue to evaluate further costreduction activities as well as the need to further adjust production levels in the event that business conditions deteriorate further these activities if implemented will result in additional nearterm charges however we believe that our costreduction efforts combined with our strategy and our ability to innovate and execute will enable us to strengthen our relative competitive position in the current difficult business environment and will put us in position to take advantage of longterm growth opportunities when favorable business conditions emerge 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 we completed the acquisition of icos vision systems corporation nv during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we completed the acquisition of the microelectronic inspection equipment business unit “mie business unit” of vistec semiconductor systems the acquired mie business unit is a provider of mask registration measurement tools sembased tools for mask critical dimension measurement and macro defect inspection systems the results of operations of the mie business unit are included in the following table from the date of the acquisition on september 30 2008 

the following table sets forth some of our key quarterly unaudited financial information 

 

  

   

revenues and gross margin 

 

 product revenues 

product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 as a result of a reduction in capital spending by our customers due to the recent weakness in the semiconductor industry and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment which have resulted in customers delaying their purchases and installations of our products the decline in revenues reflects the slowdown in worldwide demand for semiconductor equipment as semiconductor manufacturers reduce capital spending and conserve cash in response to their business environment even as their need for more precise diagnostics capabilities increases with technological advances the weak macroeconomic and credit environments have adversely impacted the profitability of our customers their access to capital and their capital spending and are likely to result in product revenues in the near term that are lower than our revenue levels in comparable periods during prior fiscal years 

product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 as many of our customers primarily in the memory markets scaled back on their capacity investments as the market for their products weakened in addition as the macroeconomic environment deteriorated towards the end of the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 semiconductor companies reduced their capital spending which resulted in lower revenues for our products compared to those for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 two customers intel corporation and samsung electronics co ltd accounted for more than 10 of total revenues for each of the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 and 2007 no customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 two customers taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and intel corporation accounted for more than 10 of net accounts receivable for each of the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 and 2007 no customer accounted for more than 10 of net accounts receivable 

service revenues 

service revenues are generated from maintenance service contracts as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period the amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems service revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 as customers idled their underutilized production equipment in response to the recent weakness in the semiconductor industry and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment service revenues increased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 as our installed base of equipment at our customers’ sites continued to grow 

  

revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows in thousands 

 

 a significant portion of our revenues continue to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that will continue to be the case 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product and revenue mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products our gross margin during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 was lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 due to lower product and service revenues higher intangible assets amortization expense as a result of our acquisitions of icos and the mie business unit decreased manufacturing capacity utilization and excess inventory writedowns which were partially offset by lower employeerelated expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken the following are costs that were recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

 

  

  

 the decrease in gross margin during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 was primarily due to 214 million of inventory writedowns related to disposal of service inventory as well as discontinued products in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 the following are costs that were recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

 

  

   

engineering research and development “rd” 

 

 rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced employeerelated expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken as well as reduced engineering material costs due to a reduced number of projects during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 these decreases were partially offset by additional rd spending as a result of our acquisitions of icos and the mie business unit the following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

 

  

  

  

  

 the decrease in rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 is primarily attributable to lower stockbased compensation expense due to our transition from granting stock options to our employees to granting restricted stock units which carry with them lower stockbased compensation expense the following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

 

  

  

  

 during the fiscal years ended june 30 2009 2008 and 2007 we expensed iprd of 86 million 227 million and 166 million respectively upon the completion of the acquisitions during the applicable fiscal year in connection with acquired intellectual property for which as of the acquisition date technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed the fair value of the purchased iprd was determined using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value future cash flows were estimated taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology relevant market sizes and industry trends we determined a discount rate for each 

  

project based on the relative risks inherent in the project’s development horizon the estimated costs of development and the level of technological change in the project and the industry among other factors iprd was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed the development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility rapidly changing customer markets uncertain standards for new products and significant competitive threats the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning designing experimenting and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations including functionality and technical requirements 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 we determined that we would not pursue future development of certain patents initially licensed to us during fiscal year 2006 for approximately 140 million since we did not have any alternative use for these patents and we believe the fair value to be 0 the carrying value of 107 million was written off the writeoff was recorded as 100 million to rd expense and 07 million to costs of revenues in the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

rd expenses include the benefit of 217 million 204 million and 127 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended june 30 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants we expect our rd expenses to increase with increases in our business activity levels as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes 

selling general and administrative “sga” 

 

 sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 primarily due to lower expenses related to the shareholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices and reduced employeerelated expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken which are partially offset by additional sga spending and higher intangible assets amortization expense as a result of our acquisitions of icos and the mie business unit additional bad debt expense and lower gain on sale of real estate assets the following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

 

  

  

   

  

 the decrease in sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 is primarily attributable to gains recognized on sale of our certain real estate assets lower severance and benefits related to employee workforce reductions lower stockbased compensation expense and improvements in our operational efficiency the following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

 

  

  

  

 in november 2006 as part of our longterm business plan we decided to sell certain real estate properties that we owned in san jose california and livermore california based on the valuation of these assets we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately 568 million which has been included in selling general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 see note 18 “sale and impairment of real estate assets” to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

on october 16 2006 following the special committee investigation of our historical stock option practices we terminated all aspects of our employment relationship and agreement with kenneth l schroeder who ceased to be our chief executive officer effective january 1 2006 and had thereafter been employed as a senior advisor as a result vesting of mr schroeder’s then outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards immediately ceased and the 09 million unvested option shares and 01 million unvested restricted stock award shares held by mr schroeder at the time of termination were canceled accordingly in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 we reversed 203 million of the noncash stockbased compensation charges in accordance with paragraphs 19 and 43 of sfas no 123r because mr schroeder would no longer be able to fulfill his service obligations the 203 million reversal related to the charges that had been recorded in prior periods related to unvested option shares and restricted stock award shares 

in december 2006 we canceled 06 million vested option shares held by mr schroeder as of the time of termination representing those shares that had been retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted in accordance with paragraph 57 of sfas no 123r previously recognized stockbased compensation expense related to these awards was not reversed upon cancellation 

impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 

for the three months ended december 31 2008 we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit and concluded that the carrying value of our metrology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value as a result of the global economic downturn reductions to our revenue and operating forecasts and a significant reduction in our market capitalization we determined that the goodwill related to our metrology reporting unit was fully impaired as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2721 million during the three months ended december 31 2008 

  

as a result of the aforementioned impairment indicators and in accordance with sfas no 144 we also performed an analysis utilizing discounted future cash flows related to the longlived and intangible assets to determine the fair value of each of our asset groups based on the assessment we recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of 1628 million related to existing technology patents customer relationships and trademarks as well as an additional 20 million related to longlived assets during the three months ended december 31 2008 there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill or purchased intangible assets subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

restructuring charges 

in march 2009 we announced a plan to further reduce our global workforce by approximately 10 which followed our announcement in november 2008 of a global workforce reduction of approximately 15 we are undertaking a number of cost reduction activities including these workforce reductions in an effort to lower our quarterly operating expense run rate in response to the current demand environment the program in the united states is accounted for in accordance with sfas no 112 employers’ accounting for postemployment benefits—an amendment of financial accounting standards board statements no 5 and 43 whereas the programs in our international locations are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies  we expect to recognize significant cost savings from a number of activities we have recently undertaken including estimated annual cost savings of approximately 130 million as a result of the november 2008 and march 2009 workforce reductions during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we recorded a 387 million net restructuring charge of which 159 million was recorded to costs of revenues 86 million to engineering research and development expense and 142 million to selling general and administrative expense these charges represent the estimated minimum liability associated with expected termination benefits to be provided to employees in addition we are currently in the process of evaluating additional restructuring activities which if implemented may result in additional restructuring charges 

the following table shows the activity primarily related to severance and benefits expense for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

 

 substantially all of the restructuring charges related to our workforce reductions announced in november 2008 and march 2009 are expected to be paid out during the calendar year ending december 31 2009 

interest income and other net 

 

   

interest income and other net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities as well as gains or losses recorded upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts the decrease in interest income and other net during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 was primarily due to lower interest income from our investment and cash portfolio as well as lower foreign currency transaction gain the decrease in interest income and other net in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 is primarily due to the lower interest income earned on lower average cash balances during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

the increases in interest expense in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 as well as for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 were primarily due to additional interest expense as a result of the issuance of 750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax provision was 131 359 and 222 in the fiscal years ended june 30 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

our effective rate for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 included the effect of 2766 million of goodwill impairment charges which are nondeductible for tax purposes in addition we recognized an expense of 381 million related to the effect of the new california budget legislation signed on february 20 2009 which will allow for a taxpayer to elect an alternative method to attribute taxable income to california for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2011 we expect to make the election to use the alternative method to attribute taxable income to california for our fiscal year ending june 30 2012 the expense included a reduction in noncurrent deferred tax assets of 97 million and a 284 million valuation allowance on excess california research and development credits that we believe will not be utilized due to the effect of the lower apportionment rate 

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 included 529 million of incremental us tax expense associated with the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy the incremental us tax expense was a result of an intercompany licensing agreement related to the migration of manufacturing to singapore that increase in our us tax expense was partially offset by a benefit of 144 million that we recognized during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 resulting from revising the amount of prior year cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered to be permanently reinvested outside the united states 

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 included a reduction in tax expense of 153 million resulting from the reduction in tax reserves primarily due to the resolution of an examination by the state of california for the fiscal years ended june 30 1997 to june 30 1999 receipt by the company of a federal tax refund for the fiscal year ended june 30 2001 and the congressional joint committee on taxation’s confirmation of the internal revenue service’s audit findings related to the fiscal year ended june 30 2003 

our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations rd tax credits state taxes and tax audit settlements our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income non taxdeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

windfall tax benefits arise when a company’s tax deductions for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity a shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value shortfalls are recorded as decreases to 

  

capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes 

at june 30 2009 we had cumulative windfalls in excess of shortfalls of approximately 60 million recorded as part of capital in excess of par value in our fiscal year ending june 30 2010 we expect cumulative shortfalls will begin to exceed cumulative windfalls since the adoption date of sfas no 123 and we will therefore report higher provision for income taxes as a result because we can not determine all of the factors that will enter into our income tax expense computation for the fiscal year ending june 30 2010 we cannot currently estimate this impact on our tax rate for the next fiscal year 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 at june 30 2009 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 13 billion a decrease of 2495 million from june 30 2008 we generated 1957 million in cash from operations during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we used 4849 million in cash for investing activities and an additional 2991 million for financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

we have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations cash provided by operating activities was 1957 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 consisted primarily of net loss of 5234 million offset by goodwill purchased intangible asset and longlived asset impairment charges of 4526 million depreciation and amortization of 1358 million noncash stockbased compensation of 1055 million a decrease in inventories of 1202 million due to lower build plan as a result of lower bookings and a decrease in accounts receivable of 2773 million as collections exceeded shipments during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 these increases in operating cash flow were partially offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of 4325 million in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

cash provided by operating activities was 6626 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 consisted primarily of net income of 3591 million increased by depreciation and amortization of 1264 million noncash stockbased compensation of 1065 million a decrease in inventories of 1002 million due to lower build plan as a result of lower bookings and a decrease in accounts receivable of 1493 million as collections exceeded shipments during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 these increases in operating cash flow were partially offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of 1837 million in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

  

cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 consisted primarily of net income of 5281 million increased by depreciation and amortization of 1093 million noncash stockbased compensation of 996 million and noncash impairment charges of 676 million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 1073 million a decrease in accounts payable of 456 million and changes in other assets and liabilities of 328 million 

investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities purchases of capital assets to support longterm growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new markets or emerging technologies during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we paid 1414 million for acquisition of the mie business unit completed during the fiscal year also sales of certain real estate assets during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 generated 218 million which was offset by capital expenditures of 222 million 

financing activities include dividend payments to our common stockholders and sales and repurchases of our common stock issuances of common stock net of applicable tax withholding payment provided 279 million 1556 million and 2632 million in the fiscal years ended june 30 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we used 2265 million 11112 million and 8085 million in the fiscal years ended june 30 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively to repurchase shares of our common stock 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we announced plans to reduce our global workforce by approximately 15 and 10 in november 2008 and march 2009 respectively we expect to recognize estimated annual cost savings of 130 million as a result of these reductions in workforce during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 we recorded a 387 million net restructuring charge of which 319 million was paid out as of june 30 2009 and the remaining balance is expected to be paid out by the end of calendar year 2009 we anticipate incurring additional severance costs and other related expense in connection with the workforce reductions at least through the remainder of calendar year 2009 

the total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended june 30 2009 2008 and 2007 was 1021 million 1085 million and 951 million respectively 

in february 2007 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase “asr” program with a thirdparty investment bank and prepaid 7500 million to repurchase our common stock the purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased through the asr was determined and adjusted based on a discount to the volumeweighted average price of our common stock during a period following the execution of the asr agreement subject to a maximum price per share during the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 we repurchased 140 million shares of our common stock under the asr of which 20 million shares were delivered to us in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

the shares repurchased under the asr decreased our basic and diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding this decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and in connection with stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan in october 2008 we suspended our stock repurchase program 

  

contractual obligations 

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june 30 2009 

 

  

  we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition from time to time we will discount without recourse letters of credit “lcs” received from customers in payment for goods 

the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lcs and related discounting fees paid during the years ended june 30 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

  

 we maintain guarantee arrangements of 291 million in various locations to fund customs guarantees for vat and lc needs of our subsidiaries in europe and asia approximately 189 million was outstanding under these arrangements as of june 30 2009 

we maintain certain purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecast timehorizon can vary among different suppliers we estimate our purchase commitments as of june 30 2009 to be approximately 744 million most of which is due within the next 12 months actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition the amounts paid under these arrangements may change in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 

  

we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates nonstandard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

working capital decreased to 18 billion as of june 30 2009 compared to 21 billion as of june 30 2008 this decrease is primarily due to cash payments for the share repurchase program cash payments of dividends to stockholders and an acquisition in the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 offset by cash generated from operations as of june 30 2009 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 13 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 

our investment portfolio includes auction rate securities which are investments with contractual maturities generally between 20 to 30 years they are typically issued in the form of municipal bonds preferred stock a pool of student loans or collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are reset the reset typically occurs every seven to fortynine days through an auction process at the end of each reset period investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par the auction rate securities held by us are backed by student loans and are collateralized insured and guaranteed by the united states federal department of education in addition all auction rate securities held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa in february 2008 auctions failed for approximately 482 million in par value of municipal auction rate securities that we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders these failures are not believed to be a credit issue but rather caused by a lack of liquidity the funds associated with these failed auctions may not be accessible until the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures prior to the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 a total of 48 million of the auction rate securities with a net book value of 46 million were called at par by the issuer therefore no losses were recognized on these securities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 an additional 28 million of the auction rate securities were called at par by the issuer therefore no losses were recognized on these securities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 the fair value of our auction rate securities at june 30 2009 was 382 million which is included in marketable securities under current assets as our intention is to exercise our right with ubs ag “ubs” to sell these auction rate securities at par value at the earliest date possible which is june 30 2010 

by letter dated august 8 2008 we received notification from ubs in connection with a settlement entered into between ubs and certain regulatory agencies offering to repurchase all of our auction rate security holdings at par value we formally accepted the settlement offer and entered into a repurchase agreement “agreement” with ubs on november 11 2008 “acceptance date” by accepting the agreement we 1 received the right “put option” to sell our auction rate securities at par value to ubs between june 30 2010 and june 30 2012 and 2 gave ubs the right to purchase the auction rate securities from us any time after the acceptance date as long as we receive the par value 

we expect to sell the auction rate securities under the put option however if the put option is not exercised before june 30 2012 it will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy the auction rate securities 

  

ubs’s obligations under the put option are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the put option ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the put option 

the agreement covers 407 million par value fair value of 382 million of the auction rate securities held by us as of june 30 2009 we are accounting for the put option as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value under the fair value option of sfas no 159 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 as a result 24 million was recorded as an increase to interest income and other net for the fair value of the put option during the fiscal year ended june 30 2009 the fair value of the put option at june 30 2009 was 24 million 

during the three months ended december 31 2008 we made an election pursuant to sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  to transfer these auction rate securities from availableforsale to trading securities the transfer to trading securities reflects our intent to exercise the put option during the period june 30 2010 to june 30 2012 prior to entering into the agreement our intent was to hold the auction rate securities until the market recovered at the time of transfer the unrealized loss on the auction rate securities was 13 million prior to the transfer this unrealized loss had been included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss upon transfer of the auction rate securities to trading securities during the three months ended december 31 2008 we immediately recognized an unrealized loss of 13 million included in interest income and other net for the amount of the unrealized loss not previously recognized in earnings subsequently we recognized an additional decline in fair value of 54 million for a total unrealized loss of 67 million included in interest income and other net in the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended december 31 2008 during the three months ended march 31 2009 we recognized an increase in the fair value of the auction rate securities of 49 million which is included in interest income and other net during the three months ended june 30 2009 we recognized a decrease in the fair value of the auction rate securities of 07 million which is included in interest income and other net 

we expect that the future changes in the fair value of the put option will continue to be largely offset by the fair value movements in the auction rate securities we estimated the fair value of the auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value some of these assumptions include estimates for interest rates timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the auction rate securities we estimated the fair value of the put option using the expected value that we will receive from ubs which was calculated as the difference between the anticipated recognized losses and par value of the auction rate securities as of the option exercise date this value was discounted by using ubs’s credit default swap rate to account for the credit considerations of the counterparty risk we will reassess the fair value in future reporting periods based on several factors including continued failure of auctions failure of investments to be redeemed deterioration of credit ratings of investments market risk and other factors based on our expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs 

in april 2008 we issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of 690 senior unsecured longterm debt due in 2018 with an effective interest rate of 700 the discount on the debt amounted to 54 million and is being amortized over the life of the debt using the straightline method as opposed to the interest method due to immateriality interest is payable semiannually on november 1 and may 1 the debt indenture includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions subject to significant allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted we are in compliance with all of our covenants as at june 30 2009 

  

our credit ratings and outlooks as of july 23 2009 are summarized below 

 

 factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under our foreign currency risk management strategy we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates this financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months see note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description our outstanding hedge contracts with maximum maturity of 13 months were as follows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of june 30 2009 actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2009 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 8049 million excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 from levels as of june 30 2009 the fair value of the portfolio would decline by 20 million 

see note 4 “marketable securities” to the consolidated financial statements item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” and item 1a “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a description of recent market events that may affect the liquidity of certain municipal auction rate securities that we held at june 30 2009 

as of june 30 2009 we had net forward and option contracts to sell 691 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in note 16 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2009 the us dollar equivalent would have been 697 million a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 175 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows 

in april 2008 we issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of 690 senior unsecured notes due in 2018 the fair market value of longterm fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise at june 30 2009 the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were 7452 million and 7020 million respectively at june 30 2008 the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were 7447 million and 7289 million respectively

industry 

general background 

the semiconductor or chip industry is klatencor’s core focus the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is six eight or twelve inches in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers and polished to a mirror finish 

  

the manufacturing cycle of an ic is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and reticle generation the fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper “interconnect” structure typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure when all of the layers on the wafer have been fabricated each die on the wafer is then tested for functionality 

current trends 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trend such as a specific design rule shrink in today’s market driven by consumer demand for lowcost electronic goods from cell phones and mp3 players to laptops and portable devices the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in bringing a multitude of new technologies into production at the same time including new substrate and film materials and advanced lithography techniques 

while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected their adoption into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects while device performance characteristics namely speed or capacity become more sensitive to such parameters as linewidth and film thickness variation new process materials such as highk dielectrics silicononinsulator “soi” wafers and immersion lithographycapable photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the cost and performance requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 5 billion substantially more than previous generation facilities as a result chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment 

by developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment “roi” once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume our tools help ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution in addition the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules coupled with new materials and device innovation has increased inprocess variability which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling 

with our broad portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ nextgeneration products including those required for the 45nm chip generation and beyond 

our process control and yield acceleration solutions 

accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to highvolume production ahead of competitors can 

  

dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product klatencor systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer reticle and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems the ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes so they can increase their yield of highperformance parts—thus maximizing their profit 

products 

klatencor operates primarily in one segment for the design manufacture and marketing of process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industry we design market manufacture and sell our equipment—consisting of patterned and unpatterned wafer inspection defect review and classification reticle defect inspection packaging and interconnect inspection critical dimension metrology pattern overlay metrology film thickness surface topography and composition measurement measurement of inchamber process conditions wafer shape and stress metrology computational lithography tools and overall yield and fabwide data management and analysis we also currently offer products that serve the wafer and reticle manufacturing data storage solar and other industries 

in june 2008 klatencor completed its acquisition of icos vision systems corporation nv “icos” based in leuven belgium icos is a leading supplier of packaging and interconnect inspection solutions for the semiconductor industry and also has a market leadership position in the inspection of photovoltaic solar technologies and led wafers icos and klatencor are highly complementary and there is virtually no product overlap this acquisition enhances klatencor’s position in semiconductor inspection by expanding its capabilities to backend markets additionally this acquisition provides klatencor entry into the potentially highgrowth solar market 

klatencor’s icos designs and manufactures three main product lines 1 component inspection which is used for inspection of semiconductor ic packaging 2 wafer inspection systems that perform twoand threedimensional 2d and 3d inspection of semiconductor or led wafers both whole and diced and 3 solar inspection where klatencor’s icos is a leading provider of systems that inspect photovoltaic solar wafers and solar cells during solar pv cell manufacturing these systems help solar wafer and solar cell makers accept or reject products as well as improve production yield drive down costs and improve cell efficiency 

our offerings can be broadly categorized into four groups defect inspection metrology product related services and software for our customers manufacturing larger designrule devices we provide refurbished klatencor certified tools along with service and support 

defect inspection 

klatencor’s defect inspection tools allow our customers to detect count classify and characterize yield failures caused by particles residues and other contaminants as well as pattern defects surface anomalies and electrical issues during all stages of the ic manufacturing process our portfolio of tools enables our customers to ramp their production lines faster by finding new defect types during development and ramp and to maintain high and stable yields by monitoring defect count by type during production 

the number of yieldrelevant defects increases as semiconductor process tolerances “process windows” become tighter a result of smaller more densely packed semiconductor circuit patterns also new defect types and yield issues arise from the necessary introduction of innovative materials device structures and lithography techniques as a result chip manufacturers need to inspect more wafers per lot more process layers and more area on the wafer at higher sensitivities klatencor supplies a wide portfolio of high performance inspection review classification and analysis systems that enable our customers to solve their toughest yield issues 

  

highsensitivity broadband brightfield inspection 

brightfield inspection systems provide benchmark sensitivity to small defects and capture a large range of defect types which becomes increasingly important as our customers move to 45nm and smaller production our 28xx brightfield inspection systems have been widely adopted at leadingedge memory logic and foundry fabs worldwide because they deliver the sensitivity and productionworthy performance that chipmakers need to produce marketleading devices key to the 28xx inspection system’s success is the fullspectrum broadband light source spanning deep ultraviolet to visible wavelengths with the ability to tune its wavelength and employ various optical modes and algorithms the 28xx inspection systems provide sensitivity to a broad range of defect types throughout the chip manufacturing process 

highperformance darkfield inspection 

darkfield inspection systems are used to cost effectively monitor process tools for defect yield excursions our widelyadopted puma ™ 91xx darkfield imaging inspection systems leverage our patented streak™ laser imaging technology to produce the high sensitivities at production throughputs combining advanced uvlaser illumination optics with a solidstate sensor to image the scattered light streak is scalable for multiple technology generations 

electronbeam inspection 

for advanced ic manufacturing ebeam inspection is essential—not only during ic development where the highest sensitivity is needed to discover defects but also in production where dedicated systems are required to monitor key process steps for defect excursions ebeam technology is often used to find small physical defects that are not detected optically in addition only ebeam inspection can detect the subtle electrical defects that plague our customers as they introduce new materials and device structures in july 2008 we launched our latest ebeam inspection system the es35 featuring improved sensitivity and throughput and onboard review and classification 

high resolution electron beam review and classification 

once a defect has been identified a chipmaker must be able to review and classify the defect in order to identify and address the cause of the defect our edr5200 defect review and classification system features a lens that delivers a significant improvement in resolution meeting production and process development requirements for advanced designrule semiconductor devices unique connectivity technology between the edr™5200 and our marketleading inspection systems provides additional benefits to our customers with respect to defect redetection classification and speed 

reticle inspection 

reticles are highprecision quartz plates that contain microscopic images of electronic circuits placed into steppers or scanners reticles are used to transfer circuit patterns onto wafers to fabricate ics it is extremely important that these features are printed correctly on the reticles very small variations in line width or placement or defects within or adjacent to these structures can cause devastating yield loss in the printed die 

terascanhr ™ reticle inspection system provides unique defectdetection and productivity features that facilitate the production of defectfree reticles the system includes higher resolution optical imaging and several new inspection modes that enable the system to find all types of reticle defects the terascanhr system’s high sensitivity improved productivity and flexible configurations make it a costeffective solution that meets the needs of reticle manufacturers in april 2008 we introduced our latest reticle inspection capability wafer plane inspection “wpi” on the terascanhr platform this new capability for the development of 32nm reticles identifies critical defects that will print on the wafer 

  

in february 2008 we launched a new family of three reticle inspection systems called terafab based on the terascanhr platform targeting ic fabs the terafab systems offer a variety of options to qualify incoming reticles and inspect production reticles for contaminants that reduce yield and increase production risk 

unpatterned wafer surface inspection 

having a defectfree wafer substrate is essential since defects on the surface of the wafer can adversely affect subsequent semiconductor processes and ultimately impact ic performance the surfscan sp2 xp inspection system has the speed and sensitivity of the surfscan sp2 plus a new optical subsystem that allows the tool to distinguish between inherent defects in the silicon crystal—which can kill transistors and thus require scrapping the wafer—and other defect types that may be eliminated through cleaning or repolishing the wafer the surfscan sp2 xp provides wafer manufacturers with the ability to scrap fewer wafers enhancing their profitability 

for the qualification of new or recently serviced process tools or for monitoring contamination from process tools already in production chipmakers may prefer to use bare or blanketfilm “monitor” wafers instead of patterned wafers the surfscan sp2 family provides benchmark inspection sensitivity on ic films or bare substrates to add to the surfscan sp2 family’s capability an innovative module called surfmonitor ™ was introduced in july 2007 surfmonitor utilizes background scattering haze data from surfscan ® sp2 family systems to monitor process drift and capture lowcontrast defects without affecting inspection throughput 

macro defect inspection for wafer dispositioning 

advanced fabs require accurate and rapid disposition decision making during manufacturing as well as quick assessment of tool and process module output our automated wafer and tool dispositioning system captures a broad range of defect types at very high throughput—enabling inspection of 100 of wafer lots 

wafer edge inspection 

as customers move to smaller design rules and new more complex material stacks the high stress wafer edge region has become a source of yieldlimiting defects material at the edge of the wafer can flake off and fall onto the regions where the chips are being built causing loss of yield the recent introduction of immersion lithography adds to the potential for flakes to migrate and cause yield loss since the flakes can be transported by the immersion fluid 

to help customers identify and fix these edgerelated yield issues klatencor offers the visedge ™ cv300 system the tool’s unique optics design and advanced defect classification capabilities allow ic manufacturers to capture a wide range of waferedge defect types with high sensitivity 

component inspection 

our component inspection systems inspect various components that are handled in trays most commonly semiconductor chips they inspect for 3d planarity evenness of contacts and 2d surface aspects as well as identification marks and orientation after inspection the systems can sort the components and even tape them 

we manufacture a range of component inspection systems the icos cit120 features the latest innovations in vision technology and component handling the icos cit120s and icos cit130s systems offer 2d and 3d metrology and inspection for flipchip packaging combining bump inspection substrate top and bottom surface inspection and substrate warpage inspection in one system the icos ci9x50 is a fully automatic system for the final inspection of traybased semiconductor components it moves the components to the inspection stations sorts them and if required transfers them to tape the icos ci3050 is a component inspector for inspecting small lots and qa samples performing 2d and 3d inspections 

  

backend wafer inspection 

backend wafer inspection is performed either before or after the chips are cut diced from the wafer two main versions of the wafer inspection systems are the icos wi22002300 which perform 100 automated optical inspection and metrology of microelectronic devices on a variety of wafer substrates this inspection system combines surface inspection and 2d bump inspection for semiconductor ics optoelectronics advanced packaging and mems the icos wi32003300 wafer inspector combines surface inspection and 2d3d bump inspection in one high speed pass

transparent film and opaque substrate inspection 

understanding the optical surface properties of modern materials has become a critical part of manufacturing with the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes and products comes the need for precise analysis and control of surface properties such as film thickness uniformity contamination and defectivity often in real time and online the candela ™ cs20 optical surface analyzer automatically detects and classifies surface defects on optoelectronic and semiconductor wafers including wafers made of transparent materials such as sapphire and glass by simultaneously measuring reflectivity and topographic variations on the surface these systems enable customers to inspect epitaxial layers and film coatings for uniformity issues and defects in substrate and media manufacturing the candela 6100 and 6300 series’ patented xbeam optical surface analyzers enable defect detection and characterization for magnetic disk media inspection 

metrology 

metrology is a critical discipline in the production of high performance reliable devices whether verifying that a design will be manufacturable characterizing a new process or monitoring highvolume manufacturing processes our comprehensive set of metrology analysis and process window optimization products gives ic manufacturers the ability to maintain tight control of their processes 

optical overlay metrology 

decreasing linewidths larger die sizes and increasing chip density all affect the tolerances for layertolayer alignment or overlay  misregistration errors represent a crucial cause of yield loss today’s lithography scanners or steppers require precise monitoring to ensure layertolayer alignment is withinspecifications these advanced lithography systems also require regular maintenance and performance tests to ensure they are meeting process requirements overlay metrology systems verify scanner or stepper performance by measuring the pattern alignment between adjacent layers of the chip as it is built 

in june 2008 we introduced the archer 200™ overlay control system based on the industryproven archer ™ platform redesigned optics and performance improvements combine to deliver the high levels of overlay measurement performance and productivity needed for 32nm doublepatterning lithography 

cd metrology 

the critical dimension is the smallest intended linewidth for a given device while a useful measurement for previousgeneration devices traditional cd measurements no longer provide all the information that chipmakers need to accurately predict yield and transistor performance instead complete 

  

profile information including the width at the top and bottom of the feature the sidewall angle and the height or depth of the feature are needed for this reason cd control in the fab is increasingly changing from traditional cdsem scanning electron microscope measurements to optical cd 

the spectracdxt™ is our fourthgeneration of inline optical cd metrology systems for advanced patterning process control the spectracdxt is a nondestructive dedicated cd and profile metrology system built on our highthroughput productionproven archer platform 

film measurement 

our film metrology systems measure a variety of optical and electrical properties of thin films deposited on a wafer these systems are used to control a wide range of wafer fabrication steps where both withinwafer and wafertowafer process uniformity are critical to achieving high device performance at low cost our systems use a range of optical and electrical measurement technologies to monitor such critical parameters as film thickness charge composition stress and electrical interface quality 

in december 2007 we introduced a significant advancement in films metrology with the aleris™ product line followed by the introduction of additional aleris systems in january 2008 our singletool solution allows for production monitoring of critical gate applications at 45nm and beyond and is designed to meet tighter process tolerances for thickness refractive index and stress measurements over a broad range of applications including diffusion chemical vapor disposition “cvd” etch and others

customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout the united states europe asiapacific and japan staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers from each of these regions in each of the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 2007 and 2006 no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues 

  

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are aimed at building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility that are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier our revenues are derived primarily from product sales mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in the united states europe asiapacific and japan we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to fully meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2008 we employed approximately 2500 sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of whollyowned subsidiaries or branches in other countries including belgium china france germany hong kong india israel italy japan malaysia singapore south korea taiwan thailand and the united kingdom international revenues accounted for approximately 79 76 and 80 of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 15 “segment reporting and geographic information” to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for our equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country the revenues from our international business may also be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates although we attempt to manage the currency risk inherent in nondollar product sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our backlog for system shipments and associated warranty totaled 715 million and 1061 million as of june 30 2008 and 2007 respectively and includes sales orders where written customer requests have been received and the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months we make backlog adjustments for backlog obtained from acquired companies cancellations customer delivery date changes and currency adjustments orders for service contracts and unreleased products are excluded from backlog all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalties due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders and as some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding period 

  

research and development 

the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs as part of our customer relationships we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby our customers offset certain of our research and development costs as of june 30 2008 we employed approximately 1300 research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during fiscal year 2008 involved development of process control and yield management equipment for sub65nm processing for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

in order to make continuing developments in the semiconductor industry we are committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development new product introductions may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in san jose and milpitas california with additional significant operations in singapore israel china and belgium as of june 30 2008 we employed approximately 1000 manufacturing personnel 

many of the parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” that we use are standard commercial products although certain parts are made to our specifications we use numerous vendors to supply parts for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts by monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers and by ensuring adequate inventories of key parts are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have such as applied materials inc and hitachi electronics engineering co ltd we may also face future competition from new 

  

market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability installed base and technical service and support we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions and alliances 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition additional information regarding our business combinations during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 can be found in note 4 “business combinations” to the consolidated financial statements 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

employees 

as of june 30 2008 we employed approximately 6000 people none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks associated with our industry and market conditions 

the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict this cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and in some cases future expense levels in the current environment our ability to accurately predict our future operating results is particularly low during down cycles in our industry the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted which could result not only in a decrease in orders but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers furthermore in the current credit environment it may be more difficult for our customers to raise capital whether debt or equity to finance their purchases of capital equipment including the products we sell if our customers experience persistent difficulties in raising capital for equipment financing we could experience a decrease in orders for our products when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound during periods of declining revenues such as in the current environment we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees if we fail to respond then our business could be seriously harmed in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

our business is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses the vast majority of our annual revenue is derived from outside the united states and we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue a protracted global economic slowdown may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the vast majority of our annual revenue is derived from outside the united states and we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue our international revenue and operations are affected by economic conditions specific to each country and region because of our significant dependence on international revenue a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business could negatively affect our operating results managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents challenges associated with among other things cultural diversity and organizational alignment moreover each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period periodic local or international economic downturns trade balance issues political instability legal or regulatory changes or terrorism in regions where we have operations along with fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our business and results of operations although we attempt to manage nearterm currency risks through the use of hedging instruments there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we possess we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor 

  

equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets loss of competitive position could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenue gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

risks related to our business 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions for example the size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink and the industry is currently transitioning to the use of new materials and innovative fab processes while we expect these trends will increase our customers’ reliance on our diagnostic products we cannot be sure that they will directly improve our business these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards to develop and introduce new products and services that successfully address changing customer needs to win market acceptance of these new products and services and to manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner 

in this environment we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance features and functionality substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products moreover we supplement our research and development efforts with a significant focus on acquisitions and investments in third parties there can be no assurance that revenue from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development acquisition or investment expenditures associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

our business would be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

most of our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states with additional operations located in israel and singapore operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors are subject to 

  

disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism fire earthquake energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers we cannot ensure that alternate production capacity would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if it were available it could be obtained on favorable terms 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation and logistics management of spare parts to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered or our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers due to events such as regional economic business environmental or political events information technology system failures or military actions could adversely impact our operations and our ability to ship products manage our product inventory or record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets and market share 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we have also published internal policies that set forth how employees and contractors are to handle our proprietary information we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and policies and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in any event the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors 

we might be involved in intellectual property disputes or other intellectual property infringement claims that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual 

  

property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information litigation tends to be expensive and requires significant management time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of operations or business if we lose or have to settle a case on significantly adverse terms our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms or the instigation of litigation or other administrative proceedings could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future our business and operations could be harmed 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current shareholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected in addition we may lose key employees of the acquired companies as a result risks associated with acquisition transactions may give rise to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

compliance with federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq requirements is becoming increasingly complex and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operation could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism which affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business increased international political instability disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks and the continuing instability in the middle east may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations such continuing instability could cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate this same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if this international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we self insure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain other risks are uninsurable or are insurable only at significant cost and cannot be mitigated with insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations most of which are conducted in california it could also significantly delay our research and engineering effort on new products most of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we self insure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also self insured either based on a similar cost benefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation rules have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

for example the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r sharebased payment which required us to measure all employee stockbased compensation awards using a fair value method beginning in fiscal year 2006 and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements has had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

  

a change in the effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business 

a number of factors may harm our future effective tax rates such as the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits changes in sharebased compensation expense changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the repatriation of nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes a change in the effective tax rate can adversely impact our results from operations 

we are exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environments where we perform our operations and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to existing new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental safety antitrust and export control regulations failure to comply with existing laws rules or regulations or changes some of which may result in inconsistent or conflicting laws rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in violations of contractual or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our reported financial results or our ability to conduct our business 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the japanese yen we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally we routinely hedge these exposures in an effort to minimize the impact of currency rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected 

there are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness 

as of june 30 2008 we had 750 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness represented by our senior notes that will mature in 2018 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and the other factors discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities 

in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of our senior notes we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of the senior notes our ability to repurchase the senior notes in such event may be limited by law by the indenture associated with the senior notes by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time if we fail to repurchase the senior notes as required by the indenture it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes which in turn may also constitute an event of default under other of our obligations 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

our investment portfolio consists of both corporate and government securities that have a maximum effective maturity of 10 years the longer the duration of these securities the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields as yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates and bond yields 

auction rate securities backed by student loans which are collateralized insured and guaranteed by the united states federal department of education are also included in our investment portfolio due to the current illiquidity in the auction rate security market the funds associated with these failed auctions may not be accessible until the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures although we believe our auction rate securities continue to represent sound investments due to the aaaaaa credit ratings of the underlying investments we may be forced to sell some of our auction rate securities portfolio under illiquid market conditions which could result in our recognizing a loss on such sales 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operation our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operation 

our global operations are linked by information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications despite our implementation of network security measures our tools and servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems and tools located at customer sites any such event could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we may experience difficulties with our new customer relationship management “crm” system or existing enterprise resource planning “erp” system and other it systems system failure or malfunctioning may result in a disruption of operations or the inability to process transactions and this could adversely affect our financial results  

we may experience difficulties with our new crm system implemented in fiscal year 2008 that could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of the results of our consolidated operations our financial position and cash flows system failure or malfunctioning could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our results of operations financial position and cash flows any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems could also adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestation activities pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 if we encounter unforeseen problems with regard to our erp system or other systems our business could be adversely affected 

risks related to the restatement of our prior financial results 

our efforts to correct past material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may not have been sufficient and we may discover additional material weaknesses in our internal controls 

as previously disclosed in prior filings by the company with the sec including the company’s annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 which was filed with the sec on august 20 2007 the “2007 form 10k” the company has undergone an investigation of the company’s historical stock option practices by the special committee of the company’s board of directors for more information regarding the 

  

special committee investigation and its findings please refer to item 3 “legal proceedings” of the 2007 form 10k as a result of that special committee investigation and our management’s internal review of our historical stock option practices and related matters we identified past material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures see item 9a “controls and procedures” in the 2007 form 10k a “material weakness” is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we believe that we have remedied the past material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures but there can be no assurance that our corrections were sufficient or fully effective or that we will not discover additional material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures in the future 

the special committee investigation of our historical stock option practices and the resulting restatements have been time consuming and expensive and have had a material adverse effect on us 

the special committee investigation and the resulting restatement activities have required us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses in addition we have established a special litigation committee to oversee the litigation matters that have arisen out of the investigation and the restatements and we cannot predict what additional actions may be required by these committees the period of time that will be necessary to resolve these matters is uncertain and these matters could require significant additional attention and resources 

the ongoing government inquiry relating to our historical stock option practices as well as any other inquiries that may be started by other governmental or regulatory agencies may be time consuming and expensive and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

on july 25 2007 we announced that the company had reached a settlement with the sec by consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of the reporting books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws the settlement resolves completely the sec investigation into the company’s historical stock option granting practices klatencor was not charged by the sec with fraud nor was the company required to pay any civil penalty fine or money damages as part of the settlement in addition the united states attorney’s office for the northern district of california “usao” informed us in july 2008 that it had closed its investigation into our historical stock option practices and was not bringing any charges against us while the investigations by the sec and usao have been completed the company is responding to inquiries from the us department of labor which is conducting an examination of the company’s 401k savings plan prompted by the company’s stock option issues the company is cooperating fully with this examination and intends to continue to do so this inquiry may require us to continue to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow also there can be no assurance that other inquiries investigations or actions will not be started by other united states federal or state regulatory agencies or by foreign governmental agencies any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we have been named as a party to a number of shareholder derivative and class action lawsuits relating to our historical stock option practices and we may be named in additional lawsuits in the future this litigation could become time consuming and expensive and could result in the payment of significant judgments and settlements which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements a number of derivative actions were filed against certain of our current and former directors and officers purporting to assert claims on the company’s behalf in addition a number of securities class action complaints were filed against us and 

  

certain of our current and former directors and officers seeking damages related to our historical stock option practices and the resulting investigation inquiries and restatements there may be additional lawsuits of this nature filed in the future we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits other than the shareholder class action for which we have entered into a settlement that is subject to court approval as described in note 13 “litigation and other legal matters” to the consolidated financial statements nor can we predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve these lawsuits if these lawsuits become time consuming and expensive or if there are unfavorable outcomes in any of these cases there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our insurance coverage will not cover our total liabilities and expenses in these lawsuits in part because we have a significant deductible on certain aspects of the coverage in addition subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and ongoing government inquiry we currently hold insurance policies for the benefit of our directors and officers although our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in some or all of these matters furthermore the insurers may seek to deny or limit coverage in some or all of these matters in which case we may have to selffund all or a substantial portion of our indemnification obligations 

we are subject to the risks of additional government actions shareholder lawsuits and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices the resulting restatements and the remedial measures we have taken 

it is possible that there may be additional governmental actions shareholder lawsuits and other legal proceedings brought against us in connection with our historical stock option practices in addition we may be sued or taken to arbitration by former officers and employees in connection with their stock options employment terminations and other matters these proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business these expenditures and diversions as well as the adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to maintain effective internal controls may cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the sec affect our nasdaq listing and adversely affect our stock price 

the securities and exchange commission as directed by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form 10k that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting in addition our independent registered public accounting firm reports on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting the company has in prior periods identified certain material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting however we believe the company remediated those past material weaknesses and we have not identified any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 although we review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the section 404 requirements if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented designed operated or reviewed or if our independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements rules andor regulations differently from our interpretation then they may issue a report that is qualified this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend special committee investigation of historical stock option practices 

on may 22 2006 the wall street journal published an article about stock option backdating that questioned the stock option practices at several companies including klatencor on may 23 2006 we received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office for the northern district of california “usao” and a letter of inquiry from the united states securities and exchange commission “sec” regarding our stock option practices later on may 23 2006 our board of directors appointed a special committee composed solely of independent directors to conduct a comprehensive investigation of our historical stock option practices the special committee promptly engaged independent legal counsel and accounting experts to assist with the investigation the investigation included an extensive review of our historical stock option practices accounting policies accounting records supporting documentation email communications and other documentation as well as interviews of a number of current and former directors officers and employees on september 27 2006 the special committee reported the bulk of its findings and recommendations to our board of directors 

government inquiries and sec settlement relating to historical stock option practices 

on may 23 2006 we received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office “usao” requesting information relating to our past stock option grants and related accounting matters also on may 23 2006 we received a letter from the sec making an informal inquiry and request for information on the same subject matters we learned on february 2 2007 that the sec had opened a formal investigation into these matters we cooperated fully with the sec investigation on july 25 2007 we announced that we had reached a settlement with the sec by consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of the reporting books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws the settlement resolves completely the sec investigation into our historical stock option granting practices we were not charged by the sec with fraud nor were we required to pay any civil penalty fine or money damages as part of the settlement the usao informed us in july 2008 that it had closed its investigation and was not bringing any charges against us 

we are responding to inquiries from the us department of labor which is conducting an examination of our 401k savings plan prompted by our stock option issues we are cooperating fully with this examination and intend to continue to do so 

we cannot predict how long it will take or how much more time and resources will be required to resolve these government inquiries nor can it predict the outcome of these inquiries also there can be no assurance that other inquiries investigations or actions will not be started by other united states federal or state regulatory agencies or by foreign governmental agencies 

shareholder derivative litigation relating to historical stock option practices 

beginning on may 22 2006 several persons and entities identifying themselves as shareholders of klatencor filed derivative actions purporting to assert claims on behalf of and in the name of the company against several of our current and former directors and officers relating to its accounting for stock options issued from 1994 to the present the complaints in these actions allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties and other obligations us and violated state and federal securities laws in connection with our 

  

historical stock option granting process its accounting for past stock options and historical sales of stock by the individual defendants three substantially similar actions are pending one in the us district court for the northern district of california which consists of three separate lawsuits consolidated into one action hereafter the “federal action” one in the california superior court for santa clara county and one in the delaware chancery court 

the plaintiffs in the derivative actions have asserted claims for violations of sections 10b including rule 10b5 thereunder 14a and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 unjust enrichment breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting such breach negligence misappropriation of information abuse of control gross mismanagement waste of corporate assets breach of contract constructive fraud rescission and violations of california corporations code section 25402 as well as a claim for an accounting of all stock option grants made to the named defendants klatencor is named as a nominal defendant in these actions on behalf of klatencor the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary and other relief against the named defendants the plaintiffs are james ziolkowski mark ziering alaska electrical pension fund jeffrey rabin and benjamin langford the individual named defendants are current directors and officers edward w barnholt h raymond bingham robert t bond jeffrey l hall stephen p kaufman john h kispert lida urbanek and richard p wallace and former directors and officers robert j boehlke leo chamberlain gary e dickerson richard j elkus jr dennis j fortino kenneth levy michael e marks stuart j nichols arthur p schnitzer kenneth l schroeder and jon d tompkins current director david c wang and former director dean o morton were originally named as defendants in one of the derivative actions filed in the us district court for the northern district of california but were dropped as named defendants as of december 22 2006 upon the filing of a consolidated complaint in the federal action 

the derivative actions are at an early stage the individual defendants are not yet required to respond to the complaints in the actions pending in california and the defendants have moved to dismiss or stay the action pending in delaware our board of directors appointed a special litigation committee “slc” composed solely of independent directors to conduct an independent investigation of the claims asserted in the derivative actions and to determine our position with respect to those claims on march 25 2008 the slc filed a motion to terminate the federal action and to approve certain settlements with individuals as identified below plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion to terminate the federal action in july 2008 the motion to terminate is set for hearing in october 2008 we have also moved to dismiss or stay the action pending in delaware that motion is set for hearing in august 2008 

during the year ended june 30 2008 we acting through the slc entered into settlement agreements with each of gary e dickerson kenneth levy kenneth schroeder and jon d tompkins related to the claims brought against such individuals in connection with the derivative actions each of these agreements is subject to court approval the agreements individually and in the aggregate do not involve amounts that are material to us as of june 30 2008 we have not recorded the gain contingency arising from the settlement agreements as the gain is not certain we will record any gain upon receiving the applicable court approval 

in addition during the year ended june 30 2008 we entered into an agreement with kenneth schroeder to resolve all claims arising from his employment agreement and departure from us the terms of this agreement are subject to court approval of the abovedescribed settlement agreement with mr schroeder relating to the claims brought against him in the derivative actions 

shareholder class action litigation relating to historical stock option practices 

klatencor and various current and former directors and officers of the company were named as defendants in putative securities class action filed on june 29 2006 in the us district court for the northern district of california two similar actions were filed later in the same court and all three cases have been consolidated into one action the “northern district litigation” the consolidated complaint alleges claims 

  

under section 10b and rule 10b5 thereunder section 14a section 20a and section 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as a result of our past stock option grants and related accounting and reporting and seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief the plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of purchasers of our stock between june 30 2001 and may 22 2006 who allegedly suffered losses as a result of material misrepresentations in our sec filings and public statements during that period the lead plaintiffs who seek to represent the class are the police and fire retirement system of the city of detroit the louisiana municipal police employees’ retirement system and the city of philadelphia board of pensions and retirement the defendants are klatencor edward w barnholt h raymond bingham robert t bond gary e dickerson richard j elkus jr jeffrey l hall stephen p kaufman john h kispert kenneth levy michael e marks stuart j nichols kenneth l schroeder jon d tompkins lida urbanek and richard p wallace this litigation is at an early stage discovery has not commenced and the court has not yet determined whether the plaintiffs may sue on behalf of any class of purchasers we and all other defendants filed motions to dismiss these cases in june 2007 however our motions to dismiss have been taken off calendar and stayed due to the agreement between the parties to settle the litigation as described below 

on june 5 2008 the court granted preliminary approval to a settlement between the parties to resolve the northern district litigation under the terms of the settlement we will be required to make a payment of 650 million to the settlement class the settlement which is subject to final court approval at a hearing now scheduled to occur in september 2008 provides for the dismissal with prejudice of the northern district litigation and a full release of klatencor and the other named defendants in connection with the allegations raised in the lawsuit by the plaintiffs and all members of the settlement class an amount of 650 million was accrued by a charge to selling general and administrative expenses during the year ended june 30 2008 on account of this settlement 

as part of a derivative lawsuit filed in the delaware chancery court on july 21 2006 described above a plaintiff claiming to be a klatencor shareholder also asserted a separate putative class action claim against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers alleging that shareholders incurred damage due to purported dilution of klatencor common stock resulting from historical stock option granting practices we have moved to dismiss this claim 

another plaintiff chris crimi filed a putative class action complaint in the superior court of the state of california for the county of santa clara on september 4 2007 against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers the plaintiff seeks to represent a class consisting of persons who held klatencor common stock between september 20 2002 and september 27 2006 alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and rescission based on alleged misstatements and omissions in our sec filings concerning our past stock option grants and seeks unspecified damages based upon purported dilution of our stock injunctive relief and rescission the named defendants in addition to us are edward w barnholt h raymond bingham robert t bond richard j elkus jr stephen p kaufman kenneth levy michael e marks dean o morton kenneth l schroeder jon d tompkins and richard p wallace this litigation is at an early stage and discovery has not yet begun we filed a motion to stay the case pending the resolution of other optionrelated litigation as well as a demurrer asking the court to dismiss the case on the ground that the claims have no merit on february 29 2008 the court sustained our demurrer and granted the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint plaintiff filed an amended complaint reasserting the foregoing claims and adding a claim under section 1507 of the california corporations code on april 1 2008 on april 30 2008 we removed this action to federal court in the northern district of california and thereafter renewed our motion to dismiss the action the plaintiff has since amended his complaint and we expect to file a further motion to dismiss to be heard in september 2008 we intend to vigorously defend this action 

we cannot predict the outcome of the shareholder class action cases described above and we cannot estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse results other than the northern district litigation however an unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a material adverse impact upon the financial position results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the outcome occurs and in future periods 

  

indemnification obligations 

subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and ongoing government inquiries these obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws applicable contracts and delaware and california law the obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters we are currently paying or reimbursing legal expenses being incurred in connection with these matters by a number of our current and former directors officers and employees although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is theoretically unlimited we believe the fair value of this liability to the extent estimable is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings 

other legal matters 

we are named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial regardless of outcome

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed the company’s related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller’s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured we derive revenue from three sources—system sales spare part sales and service contracts we typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications we also recognize revenue prior to written acceptance from the customer as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 16 14 and 4 of total revenues for the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in revenue recognized without a written acceptance is primarily driven by increased shipments of tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria at those customer fabs as well as an increase in sales of systems with perfunctory installation primarily with respect to sales of products of companies that we have acquired during the past two fiscal years shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues 

  

tradein rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases we estimate the value of the tradein right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale this amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the tradein right or the expiration of the tradein right 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed 

the deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences 

software is incidental to our products as determined in accordance with aicpa statement of position “sop” no 972 software revenue recognition and emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 0305 applicability of sop 972 to nonsoftware deliverables in an arrangement containing morethanincidental software  we periodically review the software element of our systems in accordance with sop no 972 and eitf issue no 0305 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or market demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and reserves are recorded to state the demonstration units at their net realizable value we review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis 

we review and set standard costs semiannually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and wasted materials spoilage are recognized as current period charges 

we write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

warranty we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses utilizing actual service records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge we update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we 

  

perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change and the financial condition of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to take additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

stockbased compensation effective july 1 2005 we adopted the modified prospective transition method as provided by provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payment  sfas no 123r establishes accounting for stockbased awards exchanged for employee services accordingly the fair value of stockbased awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period the fair value is determined using a blackscholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units the blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the marketbased implied volatility from traded options of our common stock we believe that the implied volatility is reflective of market conditions prior to july 1 2005 we applied accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  

contingencies and litigation we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated settlement costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 12 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

goodwill and intangible assets as required by sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests annually or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using a fairvaluebased approach purchased technology patents trademarks and other intangible assets are presented at cost net of accumulated amortization intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis which approximates their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  see note 5 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination we completed our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit during the quarter ended december 31 2007 which evaluation indicated that there was no such impairment there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities sfas no 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable 

  

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations as a result of the implementation of fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed within the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

we adopted fin 48 on july 1 2007 see note 11 “income taxes” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

valuation of marketable securities our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption related to any particular investment 

  

effects of recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2008 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 162 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  this statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states we do not expect that this statement will result in a change in any of our current accounting practices 

in april 2008 the fasb adopted fasb staff position sfas no 1423 determination of the useful life of intangible assets  amending the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  this fasb staff position is effective for intangible assets acquired on or after july 1 2009 we are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of fasb staff position sfas no 1423 on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows

executive summary 

klatencor corporation is the world’s leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries within our primary area of focus our comprehensive portfolio of products services software and expertise helps integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire fabrication process – from research and development to final volume production our products are also used in a number of other industries including light emitting diode data storage and solar cell and wafer production 

our products and services are used by the vast majority of wafer ic disk and reticle manufacturers in the world our revenues are driven largely by capital spending by our customers that operate in one or more of several key markets including the memory foundry and logic markets over the past few years customers in the memory market have made significant increases in capital spending and as a consequence contributed an increased share of our revenues these customers however have been adversely impacted by a challenging pricing environment in fiscal 2008 for their products and consequently have scaled back their investments in new production capacity our customers purchase our products to either ramp up production in response to the need to drive advances in process technologies or to satisfy demand from industries such as communication data processing consumer electronics automotive and aerospace our customers today are investing in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications as well as reduced cost which in turn are driving increased adoption of process control to reduce defectivity while demand from various industries continues to steadily rise the demand for our products is affected by profitability of our customers which is driven by capacity and market supply for their products as well as the global macroeconomic environment our revenues have declined sequentially over the past four quarters and reflect slowing worldwide demand for semiconductor equipment industry analysts expect demand for capital equipment to decline in calendar year 2008 compared to calendar year 2007 such a decline would affect our revenue levels in future quarters while capacity driven purchases by our customers are adversely impacted in environments such as the one we are currently in the demand for technology driven purchases are less susceptible to business cycles 

as a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductorrelated industries we are subject to business cycles the timing length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict the industries we serve have historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand and manufacturing capacity we expect our customers’ capital spending on process control to constitute a higher portion of their capital spending over time we believe that this increase in process control spending will be driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes the transition to new materials new devices and circuit architecture new lithography challenges and fab process innovation we anticipate that these factors will drive increased demand for our products and services such as ours over the coming years the key drivers in the semiconductor equipment industry today are the competitive pressures for our customers to improve yields lower their costs and get products to market more quickly in order to benefit from the increased demand for products from the consumer electronics computing and communication industries 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities during the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 and 2007 klatencor completed a number of acquisitions including ade corporation onwafer technologies inc sensarray corporation japan ade ltd and thermawave inc most recently in june 2008 we completed the acquisition of icos vision systems corporation nv primarily to expand our product portfolio in semiconductor packaging inspection and to gain entry into the solar cell inspection and lightemitting diode “led” wafer inspection markets icos is a leading supplier of packaging and interconnect inspection solutions for the backend markets in semiconductor industry and also has a market leadership position in the inspection of photovoltaic solar technologies and led wafers the results of operations of icos are included in the following table from the date of the acquisition of majority control on may 30 2008 

  

the following table sets forth some of our key quarterly unaudited financial information 

 

  

 revenues and gross margin 

 

 product revenues 

product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 primarily as a result of reduced capital spending by our customers due to ongoing weakness in the semiconductor industry and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment the decline in revenues reflects slowing worldwide demand for semiconductor equipment as semiconductor companies reduce capital spending and conserve cash in response to their business environment even as their need for more precise diagnostics capabilities increases with technological advances 

  

product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 primarily as a result of a higher level of orders received due to our customers’ increased capital spending in the area of process control and yield management the higher level of customer spending in the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 was driven by our customers’ demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes the transition to new materials new devices and circuit architecture new lithography challenges and fab process innovation 

for each of the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 2007 and 2006 no customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenues for each of the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 and 2007 no customer accounted for more than 10 of net accounts receivable for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 one customer accounted for 13 of net accounts receivable 

service revenues 

service revenues are generated from maintenance service contracts as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period service revenues continued to increase through the three year period disclosed in the table above as our installed base of equipment at our customers’ sites continued to grow the amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems 

revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows in thousands 

 

 a significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located and we expect that will continue to be the case 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products the decrease in gross margin during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 was primarily due to 214 million of inventory write downs related to disposal of service inventory as well as discontinued products in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 in addition the following charges were recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

 

  

   

the increase in gross margin during the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 was primarily due to increased revenues and savings realized from our cost reduction initiatives during the fiscal year in addition the following charges were recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

 

  

  

 engineering research and development “rd” 

 

 the decrease in rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 is primarily attributable to the absence of any impairment charges and lower stockbased compensation expense due to our transition from granting stock options to our employees to granting restricted stock units which carry with them lower stockbased compensation expense the following charges were recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

 

  

  

  

 the increase in rd expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 primarily reflects additional expenses related to the following charges recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

 

   

  

  

  

 during the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 and 2007 we expensed iprd of 227 million and 166 million respectively upon the completion of the acquisitions during the fiscal years in connection with acquired intellectual property for which technological feasibility has not been established and no future alternative uses exist the fair value of the purchased iprd was determined using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value future cash flows were estimated taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology relevant market sizes and industry trends we determined a discount rate for each project based on the relative risks inherent in the project’s development horizon the estimated costs of development and the level of technological change in the project and the industry among other factors iprd was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed the development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility rapidly changing customer markets uncertain standards for new products and significant competitive threats the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning designing experimenting and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations including functionality and technical requirements as of june 30 2008 there have been no material changes from the underlying assumptions that were used in the original computation of the value of the acquired iprd 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 we determined that we would not pursue future development of certain patents initially licensed to us during fiscal year 2006 for approximately 140 million since we did not have any alternative use for these patents and we believe the fair value to be 0 the carrying value of 107 million was written off the write off was recorded as 100 million to rd expense and 07 million to cost of revenues in the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

rd expenses include the benefit of 204 million 127 million and 114 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants we expect our rd expenses to increase in absolute dollars over the next several years as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes 

  

selling general and administrative “sga” 

 

 the decrease in sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 is primarily attributable to gains recognized on sale of our certain real estate assets lower severance and benefits related to employee workforce reduction lower stockbased compensation expense and improvements in our operational efficiency the following charges and gains were recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

 

  

  

  

  

 the increase in sga expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 primarily reflects additional charges recorded in sga as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 the cumulative increase in sga expenses in the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 as compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 was partially offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation expense the decrease 

  

in stockbased compensation expense was primarily attributable to a reversal of 203 million in stockbased compensation expense related to the termination of employment of the company’s former chief executive officer the yearoveryear decrease in stockbased compensation expense was also partially caused by the completion of vesting during the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 of certain options granted in prior years as well as our transition from granting stock options to our employees to granting restricted stock units which carry with them lower stockbased compensation expense 

in november 2006 as part of our longterm business plan we decided to sell certain real estate properties owned by the company in san jose california and livermore california based on the valuation of these assets we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately 568 million which has been included in sga during the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 see note 16 “sale and impairment of real estate assets” to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

during november 2005 we announced that effective january 1 2006 kenneth l schroeder would cease to be our chief executive officer and would thereafter be employed as a senior advisor the company and mr schroeder also revised his prior agreement with the company and defined the salary bonus payout and equity award vesting during the period of his employment as a senior advisor effective january 1 2006 we determined that all service conditions associated with certain prior equity awards under the terms of the revised agreement with mr schroeder had been satisfied accordingly we recorded at that time an additional noncash stockbased compensation charge of approximately 98 million relating to these equity awards the abovementioned charge is included as a component of sga expense during the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 

on october 16 2006 following the special committee investigation of our historical stock option practices we terminated all aspects of mr schroeder’s employment relationship and agreement with the company as a result vesting of mr schroeder’s then outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards immediately ceased and the 09 million unvested option shares and 01 million unvested restricted stock award shares held by mr schroeder at the time of termination were canceled accordingly in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 the company reversed 203 million of the noncash stockbased compensation charges in accordance with paragraphs 19 and 43 of sfas no 123r because mr schroeder would no longer be able to fulfill his service obligations the 203 million reversal related to the charges that had been recorded in prior periods related to unvested option shares and restricted stock award shares 

in december 2006 the company canceled 06 million vested option shares held by mr schroeder as of the time of termination representing those shares that had been retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted in accordance with paragraph 57 of sfas no 123r previously recognized stockbased compensation expense related to these awards was not reversed upon cancellation 

interest income and other net 

 

 interest income and other net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities as well as income recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts the decrease in interest income and other net in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 is primarily due to the lower interest income earned on lower average cash balance during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 the increase in interest expense in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 is primarily due to additional interest expense as a result of the issuance of 

  

750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 the increase in interest income and other net in the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 was primarily due to higher shortterm interest rates in addition in the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 we had an equity interest in a development stage company which we have been consolidating since march 31 2004 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 we acquired the remaining minority interest in this entity and subsequently sold certain assets of this entity and recorded a gain of 39 million 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 359 222 and 04 in the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in general our effective income tax rate is a function of benefits realized from our extraterritorial income “eti” exclusion domestic manufacturing deduction “dmd” foreign earnings taxed at different rates research and development tax credits and tax exempt interest 

in addition our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 included 529 million of incremental us tax expense associated with the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy the incremental us tax expense was a result of an intercompany licensing agreement related to the migration of manufacturing to singapore that increase in our us tax expense was partially offset by a benefit of 144 million that we recognized during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 resulting from revising the amount of prior year cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered to be permanently reinvested outside the united states 

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 included a reduction in tax expense of 153 million resulting from the reduction in tax reserves primarily due to the resolution of an examination by the state of california for the fiscal years ended june 30 1997 to june 30 1999 receipt by the company of a federal tax refund for the fiscal year ended june 30 2001 and the congressional joint committee on taxation’s confirmation of the internal revenue service’s audit findings related to the fiscal year ended june 30 2003 

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 included a reduction in tax expense of 797 million resulting from the reduction in tax reserves primarily due to the resolution of a federal income tax examination of the fiscal years ended june 30 2003 and june 30 2004 and the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to federal taxes for the fiscal years ended june 30 2001 and june 30 2002 

we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin 48” on july 1 2007 as a result of the adoption of fin 48 we increased the liability for net unrecognized tax benefits by 84 million and accounted for the increase as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that resulted in a reduction of retained earnings of 84 million at july 1 2007 we have historically classified accruals for tax uncertainties in current taxes payable upon adoption of fin 48 we have reclassified taxes payable of 621 million from current to noncurrent liability 

as of the adoption date of fin 48 we had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 772 million of which 725 million if recognized would affect our effective tax rate while the remaining 47 million would reduce acquisitionrelated goodwill for the fiscal year ending june 30 2008 unrecognized tax benefits decreased by 125 million related to various tax positions including the filing of an amended federal income tax return for the year ended june 30 2005 

our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within interest income and other net as of the adoption date of fin 48 we had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 129 million for the fiscal year ending june 30 2008 interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits decreased by 40 million as a result of the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits for the year 

we conduct business globally and as a result we and one or more of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in various jurisdictions throughout the world including with the united states federal government various us states and foreign jurisdictions in the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world the company is not under federal income tax examination at this time we 

  

remain subject to federal income tax examination for all years from the year ended june 30 2005 we are subject to state income tax examinations for all years from the year ended june 30 2003 we are also subject to examinations in major foreign jurisdictions including japan israel and singapore for all years from the year ended june 30 2003 and are currently under tax examinations in various foreign tax jurisdictions 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income non taxdeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions amounts of taxexempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 at june 30 2008 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 16 billion a decrease of 1312 million from june 30 2007 we generated 6682 million in cash from operations and an additional 525 million from our investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 we used 3189 million in cash for financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 we used 11 billion for the repurchase of common stock under our share repurchase program and we raised 7446 million from the issuance of longterm debt 

we have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations cash provided by operating activities was 6682 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 consisted primarily of net income of 3591 million increased by noncash depreciation and amortization of 1264 million stockbased compensation of 1065 million a decrease in inventories of 1002 million due to lower build plan as a result of lower bookings and a decrease in accounts receivable of 1493 million as collections exceeded shipments during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 these increases in operating cash flow were partially offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of 1782 million in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 

cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 consisted primarily of net income of 5281 million increased by noncash depreciation and amortization of 1093 million stockbased compensation of 996 million and noncash impairment charges of 676 million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 1073 million a decrease in accounts payable of 456 million a decrease in deferred system profit of 244 million and increase in other assets of 194 million 

cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 consisted primarily of net income of 3805 million increased by noncash depreciation and amortization of 694 million stockbased compensation of 1647 million tax benefit from equity awards of 319 million and an increase in accounts 

  

payable of 271 million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 1149 million an increase in inventories of 877 million and an increase in net deferred income tax assets of 1344 million 

investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities purchases of capital assets to support longterm growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new markets or emerging technologies during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 we paid 4940 million for acquisitions completed during the fiscal year which was primarily for the acquisition of icos also sales of certain real estate assets during the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 generated 688 million 

financing activities include dividend payments to our common stockholders and sales and repurchases of our common stock in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 we generated 7446 million in cash from the issuance of longterm debt offset by 74 million in debt issuance costs issuances of common stock provided 1556 million 2632 million and 2127 million in the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we used 11 billion 8085 million and 2214 million in the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively to repurchase shares of our common stock the stock repurchase program was suspended in may 2006 and resumed in february 2007 the increase from fiscal year 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to the accelerated share repurchase “asr” program described below this increase in our share repurchases is the primary reason for the decrease in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of june 30 2007 as compared to june 30 2006 

the total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended june 30 2008 2007 and 2006 was 1085 million 951 million and 954 million respectively further a dividend of 015 per share of our outstanding common stock for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30 2009 was declared in august 2008 and will be paid on september 2 2008 to our stockholders on record as of august 18 2008 

in february 2007 we entered into an asr program with a thirdparty investment bank and prepaid 7500 million to repurchase our common stock the purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased through the asr was determined and adjusted based on a discount to the volumeweighted average price of our common stock during a period following the execution of the asr agreement subject to a maximum price per share during the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 we repurchased 140 million shares of our common stock under the asr of which 20 million shares were delivered to us in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

the shares repurchased under the asr decreased our basic and diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding this decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and in connection with stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june 30 2008 

 

  

    

we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse in addition from time to time we will discount without recourse letters of credit “lcs” received from customers in payment for goods 

the following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of lcs and related discounting fees paid during the years ended june 30 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

  

 we maintain guarantee arrangements of 286 million in various locations to fund customs guarantee for vat and lc needs of its subsidiaries in europe and asia approximately 208 million was outstanding under these arrangements as of june 30 2008 

we maintain certain purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecast timehorizon can vary among different suppliers we estimate our purchase commitment as of june 30 2008 to be approximately 1243 million which are primarily due within the next 12 months actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition the amounts paid under these arrangements may change in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 

we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates nonstandard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 

working capital decreased to 21 billion as of june 30 2008 compared to 22 billion as of june 30 2007 this decrease is primarily due to cash payments for the share repurchase program and acquisitions in the fiscal year ended june 30 2008 offset by cash generated from operations and the debt offering as of june 30 2008 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 16 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 

our investment portfolio includes auction rate securities which are investments with contractual maturities generally between 20 to 30 years they are usually found in the form of municipal bonds preferred stock and a pool of student loans or collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are reset typically every seven to 

  

fortynine days through an auction process at the end of each reset period investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par the auction rate securities held by us are backed by student loans and are collateralized insured and guaranteed by the united states federal department of education in addition all auction rate securities held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa in february 2008 auctions failed for approximately 482 million in par value of municipal auction rate securities we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders these failures are not believed to be a credit issue but rather caused by a lack of liquidity the funds associated with these failed auctions may not be accessible until the issuer calls the security a successful auction occurs a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures as a result we have classified these securities with failed auctions as longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheet during the quarter ended june 30 2008 48 million of the auction rate securities with a net book value of 46 million was called at par by the issuer therefore no losses were recognized on this security the balance of our longterm marketable securities at june 30 2008 was 421 million although we believe these securities continue to represent sound investments we may be forced to sell some of our auction rate securities portfolio under illiquid market conditions which could result in our recognizing a loss on such sales as of june 30 2008 we recorded a temporary impairment charge of 08 million net of tax of 05 million in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity we estimated the fair value using a discounted cash flow model incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value some of these assumptions include estimates for interest rates timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the auction rate securities based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs

under our foreigncurrency risk management strategy we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates this financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months the outstanding hedge contracts with maximum maturity of 13 months were as follows 

 

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of june 30 2008 actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2008 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 4513 million excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents detail of these securities is included in note 3 “marketable securities” to the consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 from levels as of june 30 2008 the fair value of the portfolio would decline by 14 million 

as of june 30 2008 we had net forward and option contracts to sell 3170 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in note 14 “derivative instruments and hedging activities” to the consolidated financial statements if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2008 the us dollar equivalent would have been 3597 million a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 448 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on income or cash flows 

see note 3 “marketable securities” to the consolidated financial statements item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” and item 1a “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a description of recent market events that may affect the liquidity of certain municipal auction rate securities that we held at june 30 2008 

in april 2008 we issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of 690 senior unsecured notes due in 2018 the fair market value of longterm fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise at june 30 2008 the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were 7447 million and 7289 million respectively

industry 

general background 

the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is six eight or twelve inches in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers and polished to a mirror finish on the side where the circuits are to be made 

the manufacturing cycle of an integrated circuit “ic” or “chip” is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and photomask or reticle generation the fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform 

  

other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require over 500 individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper structure typically consisting of “interconnect” circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure 

when all of the layers on the wafer have been completed each die on the wafer is then tested for functionality the wafer is placed on a prober that is used to attach the inputoutput pins of the device to a tester when chips are tested on the wafer it is called sort test a sort test determines which chips are good the wafer is then cut up and the good die are bonded to lead frames that contain pins used to attach the chip to the outside printed circuit board wires are bonded from the inputoutput pads of the ic to the pins of the leadframe then the lead frame is encapsulated in packages typically made of plastic or ceramic materials the packaged parts are put through a final test and then shipped to customers this entire packaging and testing process is called the “back end” 

current trends 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with one key new technology or market trend such as a specific design rule shrink in today’s market the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in bringing a multitude of new technologies into production at the same time including copper interconnects new substrate and transistor materials advanced lithography techniques and 300mm 12inch wafers 

while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected their adoption into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects while device performance characteristics namely speed or capacity become more sensitive to such parameters as linewidth and film thickness variation copper introduces new physical defects which are harder to find within the interconnect structure as well as electrical defects which cannot be detected using conventional optical inspection systems new process materials such as lowk dielectrics silicononinsulator “soi” and 193nm photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be readied for the manufacturing process film uniformity is also more difficult to maintain on larger wafers moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face since technical challenges in bringing any one of these into production could also slow the adoption of the other technologies 

the focus of our activities has been the development of new process control and yield management tools that enable chipmakers to accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into fullvolume production while minimizing their associated risks with our portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions that enable our customers to achieve success for their nextgeneration products 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller linewidth geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the cost and performance requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 3 billion substantially more than previous generation facilities as a result chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment our process control and yield management equipment enables our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment “roi”—helping them to become lowcost producers 

our process control and yield acceleration solutions 

accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing ramping to highvolume production ahead of competitors can 

dramatically increase the revenue an ic manufacturer realizes for a given product klatencor systems not only 

  

analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer photomask and ic manufacturing processes but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems the ability to locate the source of defects and characterize process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes so they can increase their yield of highperformance parts—thus maximizing their profit 

products 

klatencor operates in one segment for the design manufacture and marketing of process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industry we design market manufacture and sell our equipment—consisting of patterned and unpatterned wafer inspection optical overlay metrology electronbeam ebeam review reticle and photomask inspection spectroscopic and film and surface measurement tools—as well as our advanced yield analysis and defect classification software to provide fabwide yield management solutions these solutions are optimized for the manufacturing process cells used in ic production including lithography deposition etch and chemical mechanical planarization cmp our offerings can be broadly categorized into four groups defect inspection metrology services software and other for our customers manufacturing larger designrule devices we provide refurbished klatencor certified tools along with warranty and support 

defect inspection 

klatencor’s defect inspection tools are used to detect count classify and characterize particles pattern defects surface anomalies and electrical failures during all stages of the ic manufacturing process from new product development through yield ramp to baseline yield improvement during volume production our portfolio includes the tools that enable our customers to find new defect types during development and ramp and monitor defect level by type during production klatencor defect inspection review and analysis tools find identify and locate the source of all types of physical and electrical defects on all layers 

highsensitivity broadband brightfield inspection 

as our customers move to 65nm production and begin development of the 45nm node they face a plethora of new defect types and noise sources as well as a dramatic rise in systematic defects arising from the adoption of new materials device structures and lithography techniques the magnitude of these defect challenges calls for inspection solutions with improved sensitivity and greater range of defect type capture on all layers in response to these needs klatencor unveiled its new 2800™ series fullspectrum brightfield inspection platform in july 2005 the 2800 features a unique broadband light source spanning deep ultraviolet duv uv and visible wavelengths and a proprietary optical design that maximizes sensitivity at all throughput settings this new fullspectrum brightfield inspector has the ability to tune its wavelength to optimize defect capture on each layer the 2800 series delivers the highsensitivity and productionworthy performance that chipmakers need to produce marketleading 65nm devices 

highperformance darkfield inspection 

in july 2005 we unveiled the puma 9000 ™ series “puma” our latestgeneration darkfield inspection platform puma represents a marked departure from traditional darkfield tools which are based on acoustooptical device “aod” scanners and photomultiplier tube “pmt” detectors—technologies that are reaching their limits puma replaces the aodpmt technology with our patented streak ™ imaging technology scalable for multiple technology generations streak combines advanced uvlaser illumination optics with a solidstate multipixel linear sensor to image the scattered light the result is an inspection system with higher sensitivity at production throughputs than can be achieved with traditional aodpmtbased inspection systems puma can be configured to accommodate applications ranging from process tool monitoring through critical etch line monitoring allowing our customers to costoptimize their inspection strategies and achieve tighter production control 

  

electronbeam inspection 

for advanced ic manufacturing ebeam inspection is essential—not only during ic development where the highest sensitivity is needed to root out defects but also in production where dedicated systems are required to monitor key process steps only ebeam technology can find the smallest physical defects and the subtle electrical defects that plague customers as they introduce new materials and device structures at the 65nm and 45nm nodes in february 2006 we introduced the latest addition to our es3x series of ebeam inspection systems—the es32 ™  a single system spanning development and production applications the es32 provides the best sensitivity at throughput for defect types that optical systems cannot find 

wafer and film surface inspection 

all chipmakers extensively utilize inspection tools to detect defects on blanket unpatterned films and bare wafer surfaces in 2004 we unveiled the surfscan sp2 ™ which incorporates a new uv illumination technology to significantly enhance inspection sensitivity and speed on ic films as well as both traditional silicon and engineered substrates surfscan sp2 is capable of detecting defects as small as 30nm at higher throughputs than those of the previousgeneration surfscan sp1 ™ dls tool 

wafer surface inspection the wafer substrate is the foundation of an integrated circuit having a defectfree wafer substrate is essential since defects on the surface of the wafer can adversely affect subsequent semiconductor processes and ultimately impact ic performance at the 65nm node and beyond transistor performance in highend devices depends critically on the physical and electrical properties of the wafer surface below it epitaxial silicon layers and engineered substrates such as silicononinsulator soi have become important substrate materials—with associated challenges the surfscan sp2 is the industry standard advanced wafer inspection system and is being adopted by virtually all wafer manufacturers worldwide to provide critical quality control 

unpatterned surface inspection  ic applications for the surfscan sp1 and surfscan sp2 inspectors include not only incoming wafer surface quality measurements but also process tool qualification and monitoring instead of inspecting a patterned wafer a bare or blanketfilm wafer can be used to qualify new process tools periodically check process tools already in production or qualify process tools after maintenance 

advanced fabs require accurate and rapid disposition decision making during manufacturing as well as quick assessment of tool and process module output operators have historically performed this task by visually inspecting a small sample of wafers under a manual or semiautomated light microscope however advanced 300mm manufacturing with large wafer surfaces smaller device features and factory automation challenges the ability of the operator to reliably and repeatably assess the wafer and lot these conditions place large quantities of valuable wafers at risk 

viper 2435 ™ is an automated 300mm wafer and tool dispositioning system that captures a broad range of defect types at very high throughput—enabling inspection of 100 of wafer lots delivering quick gonogo decisions the system enables fab engineers to take corrective action early when wafers can be reworked or process tool problems can be repaired before additional lots are put at risk viper 2435 can be integrated rapidly and seamlessly into a production environment in the lithography cmp etch and films process modules 

reticle inspection 

errorfree reticles are the first step in ensuring high yields in the manufacturing process since defects in reticles can be replicated on wafers reticles are highprecision quartz plates that contain microscopic images of electronic circuits placed into steppers or scanners these reticles are used to transfer circuit patterns onto wafers to fabricate ics the extension of optical lithography below the 130nm node has resulted in the mask error enhancement factor “meef” where reticle defects once too small to print on the wafer become enhanced in the lithography process to create yieldkilling wafer defects 

  

in 2003 we introduced terascan ™  a highresolution inspection system for xret photomasks providing a comprehensive mask inspection solution for sub90nm ic production terascan along with the revolutionary star light ™ system offers highsensitivity to detect classical defects intrusions extrusions and point defects as small as 80nm and cd defects as small as 50nm terascan has the ability to inspect nearly any type of photomask used in ic production regardless of reticle wavelength and resolution enhancement technology for sub90nm design rules 

as ic manufacturing costs and complexities increase with each technology node ensuring highyield becomes paramount for today’s wafer fabs the combination of 193nm lithography and 300mm wafer processing further exacerbates the progressive defects problem because the photomasks must endure longer periods of exposure at higher energy—creating an ideal breeding ground for these contaminants in addition to finding these elusive defects before they print reticle inspection techniques must contend with a multitude of new xret types and the increased packing density of device features associated with 65nm designs 

the industry’s highest resolution contamination mode inspection technology star light 2 ™ was delivered in 2005 on the terascan platform by leveraging platform advances in resolution along with a detailed understanding of today’s xret photomasks star light 2 takes the industrystandard star light ™ algorithms to the next level the star light 2 algorithms have been especially optimized for the mask requalification use case in a wafer fab star light 2 provides early warning on progressive mask defects as well as excellent sensitivity to traditional contamination and esd this fullfield contamination inspection can handle both singledie and multidie masks and it covers highdensity patterned areas as well as scribes and borders while improving productivity through effective defect categorization using reviewsmart ™ and litho3 ™  

transparent film and substrate inspection 

understanding the optical surface properties of modern materials has become a critical part of manufacturing in industries ranging from microelectronics to biomedicine with the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes and products comes the need for extremely precise analysis and control of surface properties such as film thickness uniformity contamination and defectivity often in real time and online this trend is paving the way for nondestructive optical metrology techniques to move into volume production environments through our acquisition of candela instruments during fiscal year 2005 we added the candela ™ series of optical surface analyzers “osa” to our inspection portfolio these systems automatically detect and classify surface defects on optoelectronic and semiconductor wafers including transparent wafers such as sapphire and glass by simultaneously measuring reflectivity and topographic variations on the surface these systems enable detection of particles stains scratches pits and bumps epi layers and film coatings can also be inspected for uniformity particles and surface defects 

process window qualification 

reticles used in the manufacture of today’s advanced ics incorporate complex resolution enhancement techniques rets that enable lithographers to extend existing lithographic processes to print features smaller than the wavelength of light used—a process called subwavelength lithography these enhancements include opc and psm technology which together reduce the size and finetune the shape of features on the wafer during the photolithography patterning process marginal ret designs can print as outoffocus featuresor not print at all creating open circuits that translate to electrical failures within the device however since these errors represent design marginalities rather than physical defects on the reticle they cannot be caught using traditional reticle inspection 

our process window qualification “pwq” solution enables device manufacturers to identify reticle design marginalities by examining the wafer for poorly printed features using their klatencor 23xx or 2800 broadband brightfield wafer inspection systems pwq enables lithographers to compare die resulting from marginal lithography parameters with die printed under optimized conditions to identify and prioritize 

  

problematic regions as a function of process parameters this method enables lithographers to understand the consequences of operating near the boundaries of the process window—allowing more informed decisions about whether to redesign the reticle or finetune inline defect and cd monitoring efforts to minimize the impact of the design error on device yield 

metrology 

metrology is a critical component of detecting understanding and correcting yield problems whether it is verifying that the design will be manufacturable fully characterizing a new process or monitoring highvolume manufacturing our metrology and process window optimization products provide the full range of the critical measurements needed by fabs to manage their manufacturing process with our unique combination of overlay critical dimension and film metrology measurements ic manufacturers have the capabilities to maintain tight control of their lithography etch deposition and cmp processes this enables them to ramp processes faster and detect process excursions earlier preventing further material from being processed 

optical overlay metrology 

decreasing linewidths larger die sizes and increasing chip density all affect the tolerances for layertolayer alignment or overlay and can result in overlay misregistration errors—a crucial cause of 

yield loss today’s lithography scanners or steppers require inline monitoring to insure layer to layer alignment is within spec these advanced lithography systems also require regular maintenance and performance tests to insure they are meeting the process requirements metrology systems are needed to verify scanner or stepper performance after periodic maintenance and to measure alignment between different layers of the semiconductor devices in production to ensure overlay errors are kept within specification 

in fiscal year 2005 we introduced archer aim ™  our latest overlay metrology solution which is designed to address chipmakers’ lithography overlay control needs beyond the 65nm node archer aim incorporates a new optic system design and improved illumination system to reduce total measurement uncertainty “tmu” a key metric of overlay metrology performance and exceed the 45nm node overlay control requirements outlined in the 2005 edition of the international technology roadmap for semiconductors 

in 2006 we introduced the kt analyzer ™ lithography correctibles platform to accelerate and improve advanced lithography cell qualification and control seamlessly integrated with klatencor’s archer overlay metrology platform for 65nm and below ic production kt analyzer provides automated ontool analysis of overlay and cd metrology data in real time giving engineers immediate feedback on the quality of their lithography process this enables them to correct errors quickly reduce unnecessary wafer rework and make efficient use of lithography equipment thereby ensuring that optimal productivity and tight process control are maintained in the lithography cell kt analyzer is now being used to enhance focusdose analysis applications at several leading logic and memory manufacturers worldwide 

cd metrology 

traditional cd linewidth measurements no longer provide all the information that chipmakers need to accurately predict yield and transistor performance complete feature profile information is needed including cd sidewall angle height and depth contact hole profile measurements are also critical since contact hole sizes that are significantly reduced or closed at the bottom of the structure can result in significant yield loss 

in february 2006 we introduced the spectracdxt ™ —our fourthgeneration of inline optical cd metrology systems for advanced patterning process control at the 90nm and 65nm nodes spectracdxt is a nondestructive dedicated cd and profile metrology system built on our highthroughput productionproven archer platform the tool is the only high performance spectroscopic ellipsometry sebased 

  

system with sub2second moveacquiremeasure “mam” time this performance allows chipmakers to detect even the smallest profile excursions and increase sampling or reduce turnaroundtime for critical cd or profile measurements cd control in the fab is increasingly changing over to optical cd from traditional cdsem metrology tools we have ceased further development of the cdsem metrology tools spectracdxt further enables this transition with its throughput of greater than 100 wafers per hour making it the lowest cost of ownership cd tool on the market 

film measurement 

our film measurement products measure a variety of optical and electrical properties of thin films these products are used to control a wide range of wafer fabrication steps where both withinwafer and wafertowafer process uniformity are of paramount importance to semiconductor manufacturers—enabling them to achieve high device performance characteristics at low cost 

in 2004 we introduced spectrafx 200 ™  our most advanced seventhgeneration thinfilm metrology system to enable ic manufacturers to achieve costeffective production control over their advanced film processes at the 65nm node and below based on our patented se technology spectrafx 200 utilizes a unique dielectric pattern metrology “dpm” capability to provide accurate and robust measurements of indie process variation on product wafers nondestructively 

contamination monitoring 

gate dielectric quality is critical to the speed and reliability of an ic below the 90nm node dielectrics become so thin less than 20 angstroms or 2nm that electrical performance characteristics of the dielectric films become just as critical as physical characteristics in determining overall transistor performance our quantox ™ product line provides noncontact inline electrical performance measurements of key parameters that determine the quality of advanced gate dielectric films including contamination and oxide thickness as well as electrical capacitance and leakage our latest quantox xp ™ system provides information on both the physical and electrical properties of advanced gate dielectric materials as well as high correlation to device electrical test data enabling chipmakers to predict transistor performance inline rather than having to wait until endofline electrical test—a process that normally can take days or weeks to complete 

surface metrology 

our stylus profilers measure the surface topography of films and etched surfaces and are used in basic research and development as well as semiconductor production and quality control the latest generation of our hrp ® high resolution profilers the hrp340 combines the dishing and erosion measurement capabilities of our longscan profilers with highaspectratio etched feature measurement capability which has historically been limited to atomic force microscopes “afm” this allows customers to monitor their critical etch processes such as shallow trench isolation “sti” and dualdamascene viatrench the p16 ™ advanced surface profiler is a benchtop contact stylus profiler designed for automated step height surface contour and roughness measurements and provides detailed 2d and 3d analysis of topography for a variety of surfaces and materials in addition we also provide stress measurement systems and capabilities such as our new wafer bow and wafer stress option for our asetf5x ™ and spectrafx 100 thinfilm metrology tools which detects reliabilityrelated problems such as film cracking voiding and lifting

our klarity ace ™ yield analysis solution enables fast integration correlation and analysis of yield and processrelated data to accurately determine the source of defects and process excursions it can differentiate between random and systematic yield problems providing users with the data they need in order to take appropriate corrective measures 

in fiscal year 2005 we introduced klarity ssa ™ spatial signature analysis a new capability that provides automated classification and root cause analysis of spatial signatures which are defect clusters and patterns that can be indicative of an outofspec process or process tool problem klarity ssa can be utilized for a variety of applications where enhanced excursion detection is needed including process line and tool monitoring as well as engineering analysis across key process modules 

our prodata ™ lithography data analysis tool along with our prolith ™ lithography and etch optimization tool helps manufacturers reduce their advanced lithography development time and cost as well as optimize their designformanufacturing “dfm” efforts 

our impact xp ™ automated defect classification “adc” solution provides consistent and accurate classification of yieldlimiting defects to help our customers accelerate their ramp to higher process yields impact xp incorporates our smartgallery ™ tool which reduces the setup time associated with adc implementation in fabs this is a critical requirement particularly for foundries and application specific integrated circuit “asic” manufacturers who specialize in short runs of multiple products our real time classification ™ “rtc” and iadc ™ technologies which provide classification and binning of defect types in real time during inspection are critical features on all of our latestgeneration ebeam and optical inspection tools 

computational lithography 

ic physical designs layouts are modified with reticle enhancement techniques “ret” and optical proximity correction “opc” to improve the patterning of features from photomask to wafers during lithography the physical design may include features that are not compatable with today’s subwavelength lithography also the retopc models used to apply the modifications may be constrained by the layout lastly the manufacturing process variability of focus and exposure during lithography may also cause 

  

errors in feature sizing such systematc errors can create either open circuits that translate to electrical failures or speed and power performance issues within the device 

our designscan ™ computational lithography solution enables device manufacturers to comprehensively identify marginal features in the postopc mask design data by performing a physicsbased simulation of the lithography process and its variability followed by an inspection of the results by comparing back to the original layout of the design the simulation and inspection is performed on our high speed image computing platform which allows for very fast full chip inspections this enables lithography aware optimization of the final opc design for the lithography process and its variabilities with the final result of improving yield and reducing mask manufacturing respins for faster time to market 

data storage industry 

in the frontend of thin film head wafer manufacturing we provide the same process control equipment with which we serve the semiconductor industry with particular strength in photolithography control in the backend of head manufacturing we are the leading provider of a range of test equipment including flyheight and head resonance testers such as the d6 highresolution surface profilers and the mrw3 quasistatic tester in substrate and media manufacturing we are the leading provider of metrology and defect inspection solutions with our candela ™ 6120 system with optical surface analysis technology additionally we are leveraging our expertise in magnetics to meet customers’ challenges in the emerging magnetic random access memory “mram” market 

customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout the united states europe asiapacific and japan staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers leading semiconductor manufacturers from each of these regions in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues 

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are focused on building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility found when dealing with a single supplier our revenues are derived primarily from product sales mostly through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in the united states europe asiapacific and japan we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to fully meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2006 we employed over 2300 sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of whollyowned subsidiaries or branches of united states subsidiaries in other countries 

  

including china france germany india israel italy japan south korea malaysia singapore taiwan thailand and the united kingdom international revenues accounted for approximately 80 76 and 77 of our total revenues in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for the sale of yield management services in process monitoring equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region especially taiwan china japan and south korea and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country the revenues from our international business may also be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates although we attempt to manage the currency risk inherent in nondollar sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our backlog for system shipments and associated warranty totaled 999 million and 646 million at june 30 2006 and 2005 respectively we include in our backlog only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within twelve months from the date of order orders for service and unreleased products are excluded from the backlog we expect to fill the present backlog of orders during fiscal year 2007 however all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 

research and development 

the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs as part of our customer relationships we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby our customers offset certain of our research and development costs as of june 30 2006 we employed approximately 1200 research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during fiscal year 2006 involved development of process control and yield management equipment especially reticle inspection and advanced wafer inspection for smaller feature sizes copperbased devices and 300mm wafers for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

  

in order to make continuing developments in the semiconductor industry we are committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development new product introductions may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in san jose and milpitas california with additional operations in san diego and hayward california migdal ha’emek israel and northtech singapore as of june 30 2006 we employed approximately 1000 manufacturing personnel 

many of the parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” are standard commercial products although certain parts are made to our specifications we use numerous vendors to supply parts for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts by monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers and by ensuring adequate inventories of key parts are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we have such as applied materials inc and hitachi electronics engineering co ltd we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability installed base and technical service and support we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity 

management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders 

  

revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions 

we continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies possible writedowns of impaired assets and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition additional information regarding business combinations during fiscal year 2006 can be found in note 6 and note 16 of the consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k we acquired all of the shares of ade corporation a supplier of semiconductor process control solutions on october 11 2006 for a total cash amount of 482 million 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secret we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

employees 

as of june 30 2006 we employed approximately 5900 people none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees 

  

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend our operating results and stock price have varied widely in the past and our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon numerous factors including those listed in this section and throughout this annual report on form 10k our stock price will continue to be subject to daily variations as well in addition our future operating results and stock price may not follow any past trends 

we believe the factors that could make our results fluctuate and difficult to predict include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 operating results also could be affected by sudden changes in customer requirements and other economic conditions affecting customer demand and the cost of operations in one or more of the global markets in which we do business as a result of these or other factors we could fail to achieve our expectations as to future revenue gross profit and income from operations our failure to meet the performance expectations set and published by external sources could result in a sudden and significant drop in the price of our stock particularly on a shortterm basis and could negatively affect the value of any investment in our stock 

the discovery that we had retroactively priced stock options primarily from july 1 1997 to june 30 2002 and had not accounted for them correctly has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we cannot predict the outcome of the pending government inquiries or shareholder lawsuits and we may face additional government actions shareholder lawsuits and other legal proceedings related to our historical 

  

stock option practices and the remedial actions we have taken all of these events have required us and will continue to require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses this could divert attention and resources from the operation of our business and adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations 

the special committee investigation of our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements has been time consuming and expensive and has had a material adverse effect on us 

the special committee investigation and restatement activities have required us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting legal and other expenses the resulting restatements have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations we have recorded additional pretax noncash stockbased compensation expense of a 348 million for the periods from july 1 1994 to june 30 2005 under apb opinion no 25 and b 22 million for the year ended june 30 2006 under sfas no 123r we expect to amortize an additional 6 million of such expenses in future periods in addition we have established a special litigation committee to oversee the litigation matters that arose out of the investigation and the restatements and we cannot predict what additional actions may be required by these committees the period of time necessary to resolve these followup matters is uncertain and these matters could require significant additional attention and resources 

the ongoing government inquiries relating to our historical stock option practices are time consuming and expensive and could result in injunctions fines and penalties that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the inquiries by the united states attorney’s office for the northern district of california “usao” and the united states securities and exchange commission “sec” into our historical stock option practices are ongoing we have fully cooperated with the usao and the sec and intend to continue to do so the period of time necessary to resolve these inquiries is uncertain and we cannot predict the outcome of these inquiries or whether we will face additional government inquiries investigations or other actions related to our historical stock option practices these inquiries will likely require us to continue to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses and could result in civil and criminal actions seeking among other things injunctions against the company and the payment of significant fines and penalties by the company which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we have not been in compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements and may continue to face compliance issues with both if we are unable to remain in compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements there may be a material adverse effect on the company and our stockholders 

due to the special committee investigation and resulting restatements we could not file our periodic reports with the sec on time and faced the possibility of delisting of our stock from the nasdaq global select market with the filing of this report and our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2006 we believe we have returned to full compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements and therefore that the nasdaq delisting matter is now closed however if the sec has comments on these reports or other reports that we previously filed that require us to file amended reports or if the nasdaq listing qualifications panel does not concur that we are in compliance with applicable listing requirements we may be unable to maintain an effective listing of our stock on a national securities exchange if this happens the price of our stock and the ability of our stockholders to trade in our stock could be adversely affected in addition we would be subject to a number of restrictions regarding the registration of our stock under federal securities laws and we would not be able to issue stock options or other equity awards to our employees or allow them to exercise their outstanding options which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

we have been named as a party to a number of shareholder derivative and class action lawsuits relating to our historical stock option practices and we may be named in additional lawsuits in the future this litigation could become time consuming and expensive and could result in the payment of significant judgments and settlements which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements a number of derivative actions were filed against certain of our current and former directors and officers purporting to assert claims on the company’s behalf in addition a number of securities class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers seeking damages related to our historical stock option practices and the resulting investigation inquiries and restatements there may be additional lawsuits of this nature filed in the future we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits nor can we predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve these lawsuits if these lawsuits become time consuming and expensive or if there are unfavorable outcomes in any of these cases there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our insurance coverage will not cover our total liabilities and expenses in these lawsuits in part because we have a significant deductible on certain aspects of the coverage in addition subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related government inquiries and litigation we currently hold insurance policies for the benefit of our directors and officers although our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in some or all of these matters furthermore the insurers may seek to deny or limit coverage in some or all of these matters in which case we may have to selffund all or a substantial portion of our indemnification obligations 

we are subject to the risks of additional lawsuits in connection with our historical stock option practices the resulting restatements and the remedial measures we have taken 

in addition to the possibilities that there may be additional governmental actions and shareholder lawsuits against us we may be sued or taken to arbitration by former officers and employees in connection with their stock options employment terminations and other matters these lawsuits may be time consuming and expensive and cause further distraction from the operation of our business the adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our efforts to correct past material weaknesses in our internal controls may not have been sufficient and we may discover additional material weaknesses in our internal controls 

as a result of the special committee investigation and our management’s internal review of our historical stock option practices and related matters we identified past material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures see item 9a—controls and procedures a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of them that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement in our financial statements will not be prevented or detected we believe that we have remedied the past material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures but there can be no assurance that our corrections were sufficient or fully effective or that we will not discover additional material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures in the future 

failure to maintain effective internal controls may cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the sec affect our nasdaq listing and adversely affect our stock price 

the securities and exchange commission as directed by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form 10k that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of 

  

the company’s internal control over financial reporting in addition our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting although we review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the section 404 requirements if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented designed operated or reviewed or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements rules andor regulations differently from our interpretation then they may decline to attest to management’s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price 

federal securities laws rules and regulations as well as nasdaq rules and regulations require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations these laws rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations 

it may be difficult or costly to obtain director and officer insurance coverage as a result of our stock options problems 

we expect that the issues arising from our previous retroactive pricing of stock options will make it more difficult to obtain director and officer insurance coverage in the future if we are able to obtain this coverage it could be significantly more costly than in the past which would have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flow as a result of this and related factors our directors and officers could face increased risks of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties as a result we may have difficultly attracting and retaining qualified directors and officers which could adversely affect our business 

the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict this cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and thus future expense levels when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound during a down cycle we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles 

our business is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses a majority of our annual revenue is derived from outside the united states and we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue a protracted global economic slowdown may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

a majority of our annual revenue is derived from outside the united states and we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue our international revenue and operations are affected by economic conditions specific to each country and region because of our significant dependence on international revenue a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we 

  

do business could negatively affect our operating results managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents challenges associated with among other things cultural diversity and organizational alignment moreover each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period periodic local or international economic downturns trade balance issues political instability or terrorism in regions where we have operations along with fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our business and results of operations although we attempt to manage nearterm currency risks through the use of hedging instruments there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate 

our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services similar to what we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets loss of competitive position could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenue gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions for example in the current semiconductor industry the size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink and the industry is currently transitioning to the use of new materials and innovative fab processes while we expect these trends will increase our customers’ reliance on our diagnostic products we cannot ensure that they will directly improve our business these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards to develop and introduce new products which successfully address changing customer needs to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner 

in this environment we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance features and functionality substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products there can be no assurance that revenue from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements in addition we cannot ensure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

  

our business would be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and costeffective manner 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have 

guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 

disruption of our manufacturing facilities due to earthquake flood other natural catastrophic events or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

most of our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states with small operations located in israel and singapore operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism fire earthquake energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers we cannot ensure that alternate production capacity would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if it were available it could be obtained on favorable terms 

we outsource a number of services to thirdparty service providers which decreases our control over the performance of these functions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers could adversely impact our operations 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation and logistics management of spare parts to domestic and overseas thirdparty service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered or our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers due to events such as regional economic business environmental political or informational technology system failures or military actions could adversely impact our operations and our ability to ship products manage our product inventory or record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights if we are unable to maintain our lead or protect our proprietary technology we may lose valuable assets and market share 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our technology that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality 

  

and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 

we might be involved in intellectual property disputes or other intellectual property infringement claims that may be costly to resolve prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information litigation tends to be expensive and requires significant management time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of operations or business if we lose or have to settle a case on significantly adverse terms our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms or instigation of litigation or other administrative proceedings could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our key employees our sales and product development could be harmed 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future our business and operations could be harmed 

we have made and we expect to continue to make acquisitions that could cause diversion of company’s resources and our operating results could be harmed 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources we also seek to acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with the integration of the operations and personnel technologies and products of the acquired companies the possible writedowns of impaired assets and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could seriously harm our business 

we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war if international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operation could be harmed 

the threat of terrorism targeted at the regions of the world in which we do business including the united states increases the uncertainty in our markets any act of terrorism which affects the economy or the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business increased international political instability disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks and the continuing instability in the middle east may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations such continuing instability could cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate this 

  

same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if this international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

we self insure certain risks including earthquake risk if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain other risks are uninsurable or are insurable only at significant costs and cannot be mitigated with insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations most of which are conducted in california it could also significantly delay our research and engineering effort on new products most of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we self insure earthquake risks because we believe this is the prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also self insured either based on a similar cost benefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

for example the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r which required us to measure all employee stockbased compensation awards using a fair value method beginning in fiscal year 2006 and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

we are exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environments where we perform our operation and conduct our business 

we are subject to various risks related to new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply including environmental and safety regulations 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we hedge certain currency risks we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the japanese yen we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally we routinely hedge these exposures in an effort to minimize the impact of currency rate fluctuations but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency rate fluctuations to the extent that these hedges are inadequate our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

our investment portfolio consists of both corporate and government securities that have a maximum maturity of 10 years the longer the duration of these securities the more susceptible they are to changes in 

  

market interest rates and bond yields as yields increase those securities with a lower yieldatcost show a marktomarket unrealized loss all unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates and bond yields we have the ability to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity 

we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operation our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operation 

our global operations are linked by information systems including telecommunications the internet our corporate intranet network communications email and various computer hardware and software applications despite our implementation of network security measures our tools and servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems and tools located at customer sites any such event could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but because of the uncertainties involved we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses 

part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful in addition we may use equity to finance future acquisitions which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current shareholders 

if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses or if acquired businesses perform poorly then our business and financial results may suffer it is possible that the businesses we have acquired such as ade corporation which we acquired on october 11 2006 as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected if that happens there may be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for a number of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

 we may experience difficulties with our enterprise resource planning “erp” system and other it systems system failure or malfunctioning may result in disruption of operations and the inability to process transactions and this could adversely affect our financial results  

system failure or malfunctioning could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of the results of our consolidated operations our financial position and cash flows any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems could also adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 if we encounter unforeseen problems with regard to our erp system or other systems our business could be adversely affected

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend special committee investigation of historical stock option practices 

on may 22 2006 the wall street journal published an article about stock option backdating that questioned the stock option practices at several companies including klatencor on may 23 2006 we received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office for the northern district of california “usao” and a letter of inquiry from the united states securities and exchange commission “sec” regarding our stock option practices later on may 23 2006 our board of directors appointed a special committee composed solely of independent directors to conduct a comprehensive investigation of our historical stock option practices the special committee promptly engaged independent legal counsel and accounting experts to assist with the investigation the investigation included an extensive review of our historical stock option practices accounting policies accounting records supporting documentation email communications and other documentation as well as interviews of a number of current and former directors officers and employees on september 27 2006 the special committee reported the bulk of its findings and recommendations to our board of directors 

findings and remedial actions 

on september 28 2006 we announced that we would have to restate our previously issued financial statements to correct our past accounting for stock options as a result of the special committee investigation we discovered that certain of our stock options primarily those granted from july 1 1997 to june 30 2002 had been retroactively priced for all employees who received these grants this means that the option exercise price was not the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date of the option but instead was a lower market price on an earlier date the actual grant date—when the essential actions necessary to grant the option were completed including the final determination of the number of shares to be granted to each employee and the exercise price—is the correct measurement date to determine the market price of the option shares under the accounting rules in effect at the time more than 95 of the total inthemoney value market price on the actual grant date minus exercise price of all of our retroactively priced options was attributable to those granted from july 1 1997 to june 30 2002 

we previously applied accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under statement of 

  

financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” through our fiscal year ended june 30 2005 under apb opinion no 25 a noncash stockbased compensation expense was required to be recognized for any option for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual grant date because each of our retroactively priced options had an exercise price below the market price on the actual grant date there should have been a noncash charge for each of these options under apb opinion no 25 equal to the number of option shares multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the actual grant date that expense should have been amortized over the vesting period of the option starting in our fiscal year ended june 30 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” as a result beginning in fiscal year 2006 the additional stockbased compensation expense required to be recorded for each retroactively priced option is equal to the incremental fair value of the option on the actual grant date amortized over the remaining vesting period of the option we did not record these stockbased compensation expenses under apb opinion no 25 or sfas no 123r related to our retroactively priced options in our previously issued financial statements and that is why we are restating them in this filing to correct our past accounting for stock options we recorded additional pretax noncash stockbased compensation expense of a 348 million for the periods july 1 1994 to june 30 2005 under apb opinion no 25 and b 22 million for the year ended june 30 2006 under sfas no 123r we expect to amortize an additional 6 million of such pretax charges under sfas no 123r in future periods to properly account for past retroactively priced stock options 

by october 16 2006 the special committee had substantially completed its investigation the special committee concluded that 1 there was retroactive pricing of stock options granted to all employees who received options primarily during the periods from july 1 1997 to june 30 2002 less than 15 of these options were granted to executive officers 2 the retroactively priced options were not accounted for correctly in our previously issued financial statements 3 the retroactive pricing of options was intentional not inadvertent or through administrative error 4 the retroactive pricing of options involved the selection of fortuitously low exercise prices by certain former executive officers and other former executives may have been aware of this conduct 5 the retroactive pricing of options involved the falsification of company records resulting in erroneous statements being made in financial and other reports previously filed with the sec as well as in information previously provided to our independent registered public accounting firm and 6 in most instances the retroactive pricing of options violated the terms of our stock option plans because virtually all holders of retroactively priced options issued by the company were not involved in or aware of the retroactive pricing the board of directors decided that we should continue to honor the options that violated the terms of our stock option plans except in certain individual cases as described below 

the special committee concluded that with a few immaterial exceptions the retroactive pricing of stock options stopped after june 30 2002 after that time there were procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that stock options were priced on the grant date the special committee also concluded that none of our independent directors was involved in or aware of the retroactive pricing of stock options based on the special committee’s report our board of directors concluded that no current members of management were involved in the retroactive pricing of stock options during its investigation of our historical stock option practices the special committee did not find evidence of any other financial reporting or accounting issues 

as a result of the special committee investigation on october 16 2006 we terminated our employment relationship and agreement with kenneth l schroeder and we announced our intent to cancel all outstanding stock options held by mr schroeder that were retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted those options were canceled in december 2006 mr schroeder was the company’s chief executive officer and a member of its board of directors from mid1999 until january 1 2006 and was a member of the company’s stock option committee from 1994 until december 31 2005 from january 1 2006 to october 16 2006 mr schroeder was employed as a senior advisor to the company on november 10 2006 mr schroeder’s counsel informed us that mr schroeder contests our right to terminate his employment relationship and agreement and to cancel any of his options we intend to vigorously defend any claims that may be made by mr schroeder regarding these matters which could involve a material amount 

  

also on october 16 2006 stuart j nichols vice president and general counsel resigned mr nichols and we entered into a separation agreement and general release under which mr nichols’ outstanding retroactively priced stock options have been repriced by increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date under sfas no 123r no incremental charge will be recognized in the financial statements for the quarter ended december 31 2006 

on october 16 2006 kenneth levy founder and chairman of the board of directors of the company retired as a director and employee and was named chairman emeritus by our board of directors mr levy and we entered into a separation agreement and general release under which mr levy’s outstanding retroactively priced stock options have been repriced by increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date under sfas no 123r no incremental charge will be recognized in the financial statements for the quarter ended december 31 2006 mr levy was the company’s chief executive officer from 1975 until mid1999 with the exception of mid1997 to mid1998 was a member of the company’s board of directors from 1975 until his retirement was chairman of the board of directors from 1999 until his retirement and was a member of the company’s stock option committee from 1994 until use of that committee was suspended in the fall of 2006 

on december 21 2006 jon d tompkins resigned as a director of the company and we agreed to modify the outstanding options held by mr tompkins all of which were fully vested to extend the posttermination exercisability period to december 31 2007 which is the last day of the calendar year in which those options would have terminated in the absence of such extension mr tompkins the chief executive officer of tencor instruments before its merger into the company in mid1997 was the company’s chief executive officer from mid1997 to mid1998 was a member of the company’s stock option committee from mid1997 until mid1999 and was a member of the company’s board of directors from mid1997 until his resignation 

although the board of directors concluded that john h kispert our president and chief operating officer was not involved in and was not aware of the improper stock option practices based on the special committee’s recommendation his outstanding retroactively priced options have been repriced because he served as chief financial officer during part of the period in question this repricing involved increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date under sfas no 123r no incremental charge will be recognized in the financial statements for the quarter ended december 31 2006 

after the special committee substantially completed its investigation a number of followup activities continued especially in connection with the preparation of this annual report on form 10k and our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2006 the special committee also continues to assist the company in connection with the government inquiries described below additional followup activities may be required 

government inquiries relating to historical stock option practices 

on may 23 2006 we received a subpoena from the usao requesting information relating to our past stock option grants and related accounting matters also on may 23 2006 we received a letter from the sec making an informal inquiry and request for information on the same subject matters we are cooperating fully with the usao and sec inquiries and intend to continue to do so these inquiries likely will require us to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses and could result in civil and criminal actions seeking among other things injunctions against the company and the payment of significant fines and penalties by the company which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 

we have also responded to inquiries from the us department of labor which is conducting an examination of our 401k savings plan we are cooperating fully with this examination and intend to continue to do so 

we cannot predict how long it will take to or how much more time and resources we will have to expend to resolve these government inquiries nor can we predict the outcome of these inquiries also there can be no assurance that other inquiries investigations or actions will not be started by other united states federal or state regulatory agencies or by foreign governmental agencies 

  

late sec filings and nasdaq delisting proceedings 

due to the special committee investigation and the resulting restatements we did not file on time this annual report on form 10k and our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2006 as a result we received two nasdaq staff determination letters dated september 14 2006 and november 14 2006 respectively stating that we were not in compliance with the filing requirements of marketplace rule 4310c14 and therefore that our stock was subject to delisting from the nasdaq global select market we appealed this determination and requested a hearing before a nasdaq listing qualifications panel on october 26 2006 we attended a hearing at which we sought appropriate exceptions to the filing requirements from the panel pending completion and filing of our delinquent reports on january 3 2007 the panel granted our request for continued listing of our stock on the nasdaq global select market subject to the condition that we file this report and our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2006 on or before january 31 2007 

with the filing of this report and our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2006 we believe we have returned to full compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements and therefore that the nasdaq delisting matter is now closed however we cannot predict whether the sec will review these reports and if so whether the sec will have comments on these reports or other reports that we previously filed that may require us to file amended reports with the sec in addition we cannot predict whether the nasdaq listing qualifications panel will concur that we are in compliance with all relevant listing requirements if either of those events occurs we might be unable to remain in compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements and therefore we might be unable to maintain an effective listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market or any other national securities exchange 

shareholder derivative litigation relating to historical stock option practices 

beginning on may 22 2006 several persons and entities identifying themselves as shareholders of klatencor filed derivative actions purporting to assert claims on behalf of and in the name of the company against various of our current and former directors and officers relating to our accounting for stock options issued from 1994 to the present the complaints in these actions allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties and other obligations to the company and violated state and federal securities laws in connection with our historical stock option granting process our accounting for past stock options and historical sales of stock by the individual defendants three substantially similar actions are pending one in the us district court for the northern district of california which consists of three separate lawsuits consolidated in one action one in the california superior court for santa clara county and one in the delaware chancery court 

the plaintiffs in the derivative actions have asserted claims for violations of sections 10b including rule 10b5 thereunder 14a and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 unjust enrichment breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting such breach negligence misappropriation of information abuse of control gross mismanagement waste of corporate assets breach of contract constructive fraud rescission and violations of california corporations code section 25402 as well as a claim for an accounting of all stock option grants made to the named defendants klatencor is named as a nominal defendant in these actions on behalf of klatencor the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary and other relief against the named defendants the plaintiffs are james ziolkowski mark ziering alaska electrical pension fund jeffrey rabin and benjamin langford the individual named defendants are current directors and officers edward w barnholt h raymond bingham robert t bond jeffrey l hall stephen p kaufman john h kispert lida urbanek and richard p wallace and former directors and officers robert j boehlke leo chamberlain gary e dickerson richard j elkus jr dennis j fortino kenneth levy michael e marks stuart j nichols arthur p schnitzer kenneth l schroeder and jon d tompkins current director david c wang and former director dean o morton were originally named as defendants in one of the derivative actions filed in the us district court for the northern district of california but were dropped as named defendants as of december 22 2006 upon the filing of a consolidated complaint in that action 

  

the derivative actions are at an early stage discovery has not commenced and the defendants are not yet required to respond to the complaints our board of directors has appointed a special litigation committee “slc” composed solely of independent directors to conduct an independent investigation of the claims asserted in the derivative actions and to determine the company’s position with respect to those claims the slc’s investigation is in progress we cannot predict whether these actions are likely to result in any material recovery by or expense to klatencor 

shareholder class action litigation relating to historical stock option practices 

klatencor and various of our current and former directors and officers were named as defendants in a putative securities class action filed on june 29 2006 in the us district court for the northern district of california two similar actions were filed later in the same court and all three cases have been consolidated into one action the complaints allege claims under the securities exchange act of 1934 as a result of our past stock option grants and related accounting and reporting and seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief the plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of purchasers of klatencor stock between february 13 2001 and may 22 2006 who allegedly suffered losses as a result of material misrepresentations in klatencor’s sec filings during that period the lead plaintiffs who seek to represent the class are the police and fire retirement system of the city of detroit the louisiana municipal police employees’ retirement system and the city of philadelphia board of pensions and retirement the defendants are klatencor edward w barnholt h raymond bingham robert j boehlke robert t bond gary e dickerson richard j elkus jr jeffrey l hall stephen p kaufman john h kispert kenneth levy michael e marks kenneth l schroeder jon d tompkins lida urbanek and richard p wallace 

this litigation is at an early stage discovery has not commenced the court has not yet determined whether the plaintiffs may sue on behalf of any class of purchasers and the defendants are not yet required to respond to the complaints the company intends to vigorously defend this litigation 

as part of a derivative lawsuit filed in the delaware chancery court on july 21 2006 described above a plaintiff claiming to be a klatencor shareholder also asserted a separate putative class action claim against klatencor and certain of our current and former directors and officers alleging that shareholders incurred damage due to purported dilution of klatencor common stock resulting from historical stock option granting practices the company intends to vigorously defend this litigation 

we cannot predict the outcome of the shareholder class action cases described above and we cannot estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse results however an unfavorable outcome in this litigation could have a material adverse impact upon our financial position results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the outcome occurs and in future periods 

indemnification obligations 

subject to certain limitations we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors officers and employees in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and related government inquiries and litigation these obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws applicable contracts and delaware and california law the obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters we are currently paying or reimbursing legal expenses being incurred in connection with these matters by a number of our current and former directors officers and employees although the maximum potential amount of future payments klatencor could be required to make under these agreements is theoretically unlimited the company believes the fair value of this liability is adequately covered within the reserves it has established for currently pending legal proceedings 

  

other legal matters 

we are named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict

restatements of consolidated financial statements and special committee and company findings 

special committee investigation of historical stock option practices 

on may 22 2006 the wall street journal published an article about stock option backdating that questioned the stock option practices at several companies including klatencor on may 23 2006 we received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office for the northern district of california “usao” and a letter of inquiry from the united states securities and exchange commission “sec” regarding our stock option practices later on may 23 2006 our board of directors appointed a special committee composed solely of independent directors to conduct a comprehensive investigation of our historical stock option practices the special committee promptly engaged independent legal counsel and accounting experts to assist with the investigation the investigation included an extensive review of our historical stock option practices accounting policies accounting records supporting documentation email communications and other documentation as well as interviews of a number of current and former directors officers and employees on september 27 2006 the special committee reported the bulk of its findings and recommendations to our board of directors 

findings and remedial actions 

on september 28 2006 we announced that we would have to restate our previously issued financial statements to correct our past accounting for stock options as a result of the special committee investigation we discovered that certain of our stock options primarily those granted from july 1 1997 to june 30 2002 had been retroactively priced for all employees who received these grants this means that the option exercise price was not the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date of the option but instead was a lower market price on an earlier date the actual grant date—when the essential actions necessary to grant the option were completed including the final determination of the number of shares to be granted to each employee and the exercise price—is the correct measurement date to determine the market price of the option shares under the accounting rules in effect at the time more than 95 of the total inthemoney value market price on the actual grant date minus exercise price of all of our retroactively priced options was attributable to those granted from july 1 1997 to june 30 2002 

we previously applied accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” through our fiscal year ended june 30 2005 under apb opinion no 25 a noncash stockbased compensation expense was required to be recognized for any option for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual grant date because each of our retroactively priced options had an exercise price below the market price on the actual grant date there should have been a noncash charge for each of these options under apb opinion no 25 equal to the number of option shares multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the actual grant date that expense should have been amortized over the vesting period of the option starting in our fiscal year ended june 30 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” as a result beginning in fiscal year 2006 the additional stockbased compensation expense required to be recorded for each retroactively priced option is equal to the incremental fair value of the option on the actual grant date 

  

amortized over the remaining vesting period of the option we did not record these stockbased compensation expenses under apb opinion no 25 or sfas no 123r related to our retroactively priced options in our previously issued financial statements and that is why we are restating them in this filing to correct our past accounting for stock options we recorded additional pretax noncash stockbased compensation expense of a 348 million for the periods july 1 1994 to june 30 2005 under apb opinion no 25 and b 22 million for the year ended june 30 2006 under sfas no 123r we expect to amortize an additional 6 million of such pretax charges under sfas no 123r in future periods to properly account for past retroactively priced stock options 

by october 16 2006 the special committee had substantially completed its investigation the special committee concluded that 1 there was retroactive pricing of stock options granted to all employees who received options primarily during the periods from july 1 1997 to june 30 2002 less than 15 of these options were granted to executive officers 2 the retroactively priced options were not accounted for correctly in our previously issued financial statements 3 the retroactive pricing of options was intentional not inadvertent or through administrative error 4 the retroactive pricing of options involved the selection of fortuitously low exercise prices by certain former executive officers and other former executives may have been aware of this conduct 5 the retroactive pricing of options involved the falsification of company records resulting in erroneous statements being made in financial and other reports previously filed with the sec as well as in information previously provided to our independent registered public accounting firm and 6 in most instances the retroactive pricing of options violated the terms of our stock option plans because virtually all holders of retroactively priced options issued by the company were not involved in or aware of the retroactive pricing the board of directors decided that we should continue to honor the options that violated the terms of our stock option plans except in certain individual cases as described below 

the special committee concluded that with a few immaterial exceptions the retroactive pricing of stock options stopped after june 30 2002 after that time there were procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that stock options were priced on the grant date the special committee also concluded that none of our independent directors was involved in or aware of the retroactive pricing of stock options based on the special committee’s report our board of directors concluded that no current members of management were involved in the retroactive pricing of stock options during its investigation of our historical stock option practices the special committee did not find evidence of any other financial reporting or accounting issues 

as a result of the special committee investigation on october 16 2006 we terminated our employment relationship and agreement with kenneth l schroeder and we announced our intent to cancel all outstanding stock options held by mr schroeder that were retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted those options were canceled in december 2006 mr schroeder was the company’s chief executive officer and a member of its board of directors from mid1999 until january 1 2006 and was a member of the company’s stock option committee from 1994 until december 31 2005 from january 1 2006 to october 16 2006 mr schroeder was employed as a senior advisor to the company on november 10 2006 mr schroeder’s counsel informed us that mr schroeder contests our right to terminate his employment relationship and agreement and to cancel any of his options we intend to vigorously defend any claims that may be made by mr schroeder regarding these matters which could involve a material amount 

also on october 16 2006 stuart j nichols vice president and general counsel resigned mr nichols and we entered into a separation agreement and general release under which mr nichols’ outstanding retroactively priced stock options have been repriced by increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date under sfas no 123r no incremental charge will be recognized in the financial statements for the quarter ended december 31 2006

priced stock options have been repriced by increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date under sfas no 123r no incremental charge will be recognized in the financial statements for the quarter ended december 31 2006 mr levy was the company’s chief executive officer from 1975 until mid1999 with the exception of mid1997 to mid1998 was a member of the company’s board of directors from 1975 until his retirement was chairman of the board of directors from 1999 until his retirement and was a member of the company’s stock option committee from 1994 until use of that committee was suspended in the fall of 2006 

on december 21 2006 jon d tompkins resigned as a director of the company and we agreed to modify the outstanding options held by mr tompkins all of which were fully vested to extend the posttermination exercisability period to december 31 2007 which is the last day of the calendar year in which those options would have terminated in the absence of such extension mr tompkins the chief executive officer of tencor instruments before its merger into the company in mid1997 was the company’s chief executive officer from mid1997 to mid1998 was a member of the company’s stock option committee from mid1997 until mid1999 and was a member of the company’s board of directors from mid1997 until his resignation 

although the board of directors concluded that john h kispert our president and chief operating officer was not involved in and was not aware of the improper stock option practices based on the special committee’s recommendation his outstanding retroactively priced options have been repriced because he served as chief financial officer during part of the period in question this repricing involved increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date under sfas no 123r no incremental charge will be recognized in the financial statements for the quarter ended december 31 2006 

restatement and impact on financial statements 

in addition to restating the consolidated financial statements in response to the special committee’s findings we are recording additional noncash adjustments that were previously considered to be immaterial relating primarily to the accounting for the employee stock purchase plan corrections for the recognition of deferred tax assets the release of tax reserves the timing of revenue recognition gains and losses on hedging contracts and the calculation of minority interest we have also corrected the classification of certain amounts presented as cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities relating to investments in variable rate demand notes for the fiscal years ended june 30 2004 and prior we previously recorded no stockbased compensation expense therefore the additional stockbased compensation expense noted below represents the total stockbased compensation expense for these periods for the year ended june 30 2005 we recorded 29 million of stockbased compensation with a related tax benefit of 11 million in our previously reported financial statements for fiscal 2005 total stockbased compensation was 370 million with a related tax benefit of 121 million the income statement impact of the restatement is as follows in thousands 

 

   

 we adopted sfas no 123r effective july 1 2005 the grant date fair values of stock options granted prior to fiscal year 2006 were changed as a result of the findings that certain stock option grants were retroactively priced this change resulted in additional stockbased compensation expense of 22 million and a related tax benefit of 12 million being recognized in fiscal year 2006 under sfas no 123r 

government inquiries relating to historical stock option practices 

we are cooperating fully with the usao and sec inquiries and intend to continue to do so these inquiries likely will require us to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses and could result in civil and criminal actions seeking among other things injunctions against the company and the payment of significant fines and penalties by the company which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow we cannot predict how long it will take or how much more time and resources we will have to expend to resolve these government inquiries nor can we predict the outcome of these inquiries 

late sec filings and nasdaq delisting proceedings 

due to the special committee investigation and the resulting restatements we did not file on time this annual report on form 10k and our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2006 as a result we received two nasdaq staff determination letters dated september 14 2006 and november 14 2006 respectively stating that we were not in compliance with the filing requirements of marketplace rule 4310c14 and therefore that our stock was subject to delisting from the nasdaq global select market we appealed this determination attended a hearing and obtained approval of our request for continued listing of our stock on the nasdaq global select market subject to the condition that we file this report and our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2006 on or before january 31 2007 

with the filing of this report and our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2006 we believe we have returned to full compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements and therefore that the nasdaq delisting matter is now closed however sec comments on these reports or other reports that we previously filed or other factors could render us unable to maintain an effective listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market or any other national securities exchange 

shareholder litigation relating to historical stock option practices 

several derivative actions have been filed purporting to assert claims on behalf of and in the name of the company against various of our current and former directors and officers relating to our accounting for stock options issued from 1994 to the present the complaints in these actions allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties and other obligations to the company and violated state and federal securities laws in connection with our historical stock option granting process our accounting for past stock options and historical sales of stock by the individual defendants on behalf of klatencor the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary and other relief against the named defendants the derivative actions are at an early stage our board of directors has appointed a special litigation committee “slc” composed solely of independent directors to 

  

conduct an independent investigation of the claims asserted in the derivative actions and to determine the company’s position with respect to those claims the slc’s investigation is in progress we cannot predict whether these actions are likely to result in any material recovery by or expense to klatencor 

klatencor and various of our current and former directors and officers were named as defendants in several putative securities class action lawsuits that have been consolidated into one action the complaints allege claims under the securities exchange act of 1934 as a result of our past stock option grants and related accounting and reporting and seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief the plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of purchasers of klatencor stock between february 13 2001 and may 22 2006 who allegedly suffered losses as a result of material misrepresentations in klatencor’s sec filings during that period this litigation is at an early stage one of the derivative actions noted above also includes a putative class 

action claim on behalf of klatencor shareholders against the company and certain of our current and former directors and officers alleging that shareholders incurred damage due to purported dilution of klatencor common stock resulting from historical stock option granting practices the company intends to vigorously defend these litigations 

we cannot predict the outcome of the shareholder class action cases described above and we cannot estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse results however an unfavorable outcome in this litigation could have a material adverse impact upon the financial position results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the outcome occurs and in future periods 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed the company’s related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows 

allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change and the financial condition of our customers are adversely affected and unable to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to take additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or market demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and reserves are recorded to state the demonstration units at their net realizable value we review the adequacy of its inventory reserves on a quarterly basis we review and set standard costs semiannually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes adjusted for excess capacity abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and wasted materials spoilage are recognized as current period charges we write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence these factors 

  

are impacted by market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 

warranty we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses utilizing actual service records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge we update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited or no historical product performance to estimate warranty expense more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates nonstandard warranty generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months nonstandard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences see note 12 to consolidated financial statements “commitments and contingencies” for a detailed description 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sale price is fixed or determinable delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured system revenue includes hardware and software that is incidental to the product we generally recognize system revenue upon confirmation by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications in certain cases our policy does not require written acceptance from the customer and we recognize system revenue upon shipment total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 44 66 and 49 of total revenue for the fiscal years ended june 30 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the fluctuation of revenue exceptions is primarily driven by the shipment patterns of tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria see note 1 to consolidated financial statements under “revenue recognition” for detailed description of exceptions shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues 

revenue from software license fees is typically recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable the fee is fixed or determinable and vendorspecific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of services andor unspecified software upgrades if vendorspecific objective evidence does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement all revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist or until all elements are delivered whichever is earlier in instances where an arrangement to deliver software requires significant modification or customization license fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting we periodically review the software element of our systems in accordance with aicpa statement of position “sop” no 972 “software revenue recognition” and emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 0305 “applicability of sop 972 to nonsoftware deliverables in an arrangement containing morethanincidental software” 

tradein rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases we estimate the value of the tradein right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract if maintenance is included in an arrangement which includes a software license agreement amounts related to 

  

maintenance are allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed 

the deferred system profit balance at june 30 2006 was 226 million this amount equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs the deferred profit balance increased from 212 million at june 30 2005 primarily because shipments were higher than customer acceptance for which revenue was recognized during fiscal year 2006 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences the unearned revenue balance was flat at 81 million at june 30 2006 and 2005 

stockbased compensation prior to july 1 2005 we applied apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” in accordance with apb opinion no 25 a noncash stockbased compensation expense was recognized for any options for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual grant date the charge for the options with an exercise price below the market price on the actual grant date was equal to the number of options multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date that expense was amortized over the vesting period of the option beginning july 1 2005 we have accounted for stockbased compensation using the fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model consistent with the provisions of sfas no 123r securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 107 we elected to adopt the modified prospective application method as provided by sfas no 123r accordingly during fiscal year 2006 we recorded stockbased compensation cost totaling the amount that would have been recognized had the fair value method under sfas no 123 been applied since the effective date of sfas no 123 for the prefiscal 2006 grants and under sfas no 123r for the fiscal year 2006 grants sfas no 123r requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options the blackscholes optionpricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of shortlived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable in addition optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the implied volatility of the company’s common stock we determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a blended volatility prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we used a combination of historical and implied volatility in deriving the expected volatility assumption in november 2005 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb staff position “fsp” no 123r3 “transition election related to accounting for tax effects of sharebased payment awards” “fsp 123r3” we have elected not to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fsp 123r3 for calculating the tax effects of stockbased compensation pursuant to sfas no 123r we followed paragraph 81 of sfas no 123r to calculate the initial pool of excess tax benefits and to determine the subsequent impact on the additional paidincapital “apic” pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stockbased compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas no 123r see note 7 to consolidated financial statements “stockbased compensation” for a detailed description 

contingencies and litigation the company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date see note 12 to consolidated financial statements “commitments and contingencies” for a detailed description 

  

income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities sfas no 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be see note 11 to consolidated financial statements “income taxes” for a detailed description 

effects of recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” sab no 108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements sab no 108 requires registrants to quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements using both the “rollover” method which focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement and is the method we currently use and the “iron curtain” method which focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the periodend balance sheet the use of both of these methods is referred to as the “dual approach” and should be combined with the evaluation of qualitative elements surrounding the errors in accordance with sab no 99 “materiality” the provisions of sab no 108 are effective for the company for fiscal years beginning july 1 2006 the adoption of sab no 108 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the provisions of sfas no 157 are effective for the company for fiscal years beginning july 1 2008 we are evaluating the impact of the provisions of this statement on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” sfas no 158 requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with singleemployer defined benefit pension retiree healthcare and other postretirement plans in their financial statements the provisions of sfas no 158 are effective for the company as of the end of the fiscal year ending june 30 2007 we are evaluating the impact of the provisions of this statement on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

in june 2006 the fasb published fasb interpretation no “fin” 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition this interpretation is effective for the company in fiscal years beginning july 1 2007 we are evaluating the impact of the provisions of this interpretation on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in february 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 155 “accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments” an amendment of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” and sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” this statement permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation this statement is effective for the company for all financial instruments acquired or issued after july 1 2007 the adoption of sfas no 155 is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in june 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” a replacement of apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and sfas no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” sfas no 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle previously most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change sfas no 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change sfas no 154 is effective for the company for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning july 1 2006 however the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements the adoption of sfas no 154 is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in march 2005 the fasb published fin 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” which clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity the uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists the interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets” an amendment of apb opinion no 29 sfas no 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged sfas no 153 is effective for the company for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the adoption of sfas no 153 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

executive summary 

klatencor corporation is the world’s leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries our portfolio of products software analysis services and expertise is designed to help integrated circuit manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire wafer fabrication process—from research and development to final mass production yield analysis 

revenues income from operations net income cash flow from operations and diluted earnings per share are some of the key indicators we use to monitor our financial condition and operating performance the following table sets forth some of the key quarterly unaudited financial information which we use to manage our business see exhibit 991 for further detail of the impact of the restatements on these quarterly results 

 

  

 industry trends 

industry analysts have predicted that semiconductor revenues and semiconductor equipment revenues will each grow in the ranges of 5 to 10 in calendar year 2007 over the longer term we expect process control to continue to represent a higher percentage of our customers’ capital spending we believe this percentage increase in process control spending will be driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes the transition to new materials new devices and circuit architecture new lithography challenges and fab process innovation we anticipate these factors will drive increased demand for our products and services the key drivers for growth in the semiconductor equipment industry in calendar year 2007 are the transition to 300 millimeter fabs the increased demand for consumer electronics and the strength of the nand flash market 

  

revenues and gross margin 

 

 product revenues 

for the year ended june 30 2006 

product revenue in fiscal year 2006 decreased 55 million or 3 to 17 billion from 18 billion in fiscal year 2005 product revenue in fiscal year 2005 increased 568 million or 47 to 18 billion from 12 billion in fiscal year 2004 product revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily as a result of fulfilling a higher level of orders received in prior periods our customers’ increased capital spending in the area of process control and yield management is due to the increasing complexity of processing in their fabs as more complex chips are produced new materials such as copper are introduced and device feature sizes are reduced 

per our revenue recognition policy we do not require written acceptance from the customer under certain situations revenue recognized under conditions where our policy does not require the need for a written acceptance by the customer was approximately 44 66 and 49 of total revenue for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

service revenues 

service revenue in fiscal year 2006 increased 44 million or 14 to 358 million from 314 million in fiscal year 2005 service revenue in fiscal year 2005 increased 17 million or 6 to 314 million from 297 million in fiscal year 2004 service revenue is generated from maintenance service contracts as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period service revenue continued to increase through the three year period as our installed base of equipment at our customers’ sites continued to grow the amount of service revenue generated is generally a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems 

  

revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows in millions 

 

 international revenues were 80 76 and 77 of revenue during the fiscal years ended june 30 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively a significant portion of our revenue continues to be generated in asia where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located 

gross margin 

our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products gross margin decreased by 3 points to 55 during fiscal year 2006 from 58 during fiscal year 2005 primarily due to cessation of development work related to cdsem and stockbased compensation expense recorded during fiscal year 2006 which contributed 1 and 1 respectively to the decrease in gross margin during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 we ceased development work on the next generation equipment for cdsem and incurred charges of 27 million related to writeoffs of inventory as well as for liabilities incurred related to the decision to cease future development of cdsem although we have ceased future development of cdsem we will continue to service previously sold equipment gross margin improved by 4 points to 58 in fiscal year 2005 relative to 54 in fiscal year 2004 due to lower cost of building installing and maintaining our products combined with an increase in revenues 

engineering research and development “rd” 

 

 rd expenses increased 42 million or 12 to 394 million during fiscal year 2006 from 352 million during fiscal year 2005 rd expenses increased 53 million or 18 to 352 million during fiscal year 2005 from 299 million during fiscal year 2004 the increase in rd expenses in 2006 is primarily attributable to increased stockbased compensation expenses in addition the increase in rd expenses compared to fiscal year 2004 is due to the business acquired during 2005 note however that rd expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005 as a result of higher total revenues during fiscal year 2005 

  

rd expenses include the benefit of 11 million 8 million and 11 million of external funding received during the fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively for certain strategic development programs conducted with several of our customers and from government grants we expect our rd expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes 

selling general and administrative “sga” 

 

 sga expenses increased 111 million or 35 to 425 million during fiscal year 2006 from 314 million during the fiscal year 2005 sga expenses increased 43 million or 16 to 314 million during fiscal year 2005 from 271 million during fiscal year 2004 

the increase in sga expenses from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2006 is primarily due to higher levels of stockbased compensation expense increased compensation expense of 70 million and increased legal costs of 21 attributable to accrued expenses related to the stock option investigation the increase in sga expenses from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005 is primarily due to higher compensation costs associated with an increase in customer application support increased staffing and consolidating the results of operations of the entities acquired during fiscal year 2005 

during november 2005 we announced that effective january 1 2006 kenneth l schroeder would cease to be our chief executive officer and would thereafter be employed as a senior advisor the company and mr schroeder also revised his prior agreement with the company and defined the salary bonus payout and equity award vesting during the period of his employment as a senior advisor effective january 1 2006 we determined that all service conditions associated with certain prior equity awards under the terms of the revised agreement with mr schroeder had been satisfied accordingly we recorded at that time an additional noncash stockbased compensation charge of approximately 98 million relating to these equity awards the abovementioned charge is included as a component of selling general and administrative expense during fiscal 2006 on october 16 2006 following the special committee investigation of our historical stock option practices we terminated all aspects of mr schroeder’s employment relationship and agreement with the company as a result vesting of mr schroeder’s then outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards immediately ceased and the 890914 unvested option shares and 100000 unvested restricted stock award shares held by mr schroeder at the time of termination were canceled accordingly in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 we will reverse approximately 20 million of the noncash stockbased compensation charge recorded in prior periods in december 2006 we canceled 596740 vested option shares held by mr schroeder as of the time of termination representing those shares that had been retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted 

  

in november 2006 as part of the longterm business plan we decided to sell certain real estate properties owned by the company in san jose california and livermore california we will record an asset impairment charge of approximately 56 million in the quarter ended december 31 2006 in addition we reduced our workforce by approximately 150 people and will accrue approximately 10 million in severance charges in the quarter ended december 31 2006 to be paid over the next twelve months 

interest income and other net 

 

 interest income and other net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on the investment and cash portfolio realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities as well as income recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts the increase in interest income and other net compared to the prior fiscal years is primarily due to the increase in cash levels and shortterm interest rates 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 04 243 and 214 in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively in general our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35 largely as a function of benefits realized from our extraterritorial income “eti” exclusion research and development tax credits and tax exempt interest 

in the year ended june 30 2006 the company reduced its total income tax reserves by 797 million of which 448 million relates to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 this was primarily due to expiring statute of limitations several tax settlements reached with various tax authorities and reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions included in the tax settlements was a settlement with the internal revenue service related to an examination for the years ended june 30 2003 and 2004 

our benefits for income taxes related to equity awards were 582 million 121 million and 223 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2006 june 30 2005 and june 30 2004 respectively 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income non taxdeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions amounts of taxexempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

the internal revenue service completed an audit of the company’s fiscal year 2003 and 2004 corporate tax returns liabilities for anticipated worldwide tax audit issues have been established based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable the company believes that adequate reserves have been provided to cover any potential additional tax assessments 

equity incentive program 

the company’s equity incentive program is a broadbased longterm retention program that is intended to attract and retain key employees and align stockholder and employee interests the equity incentive program consists of two plans one under which nonemployee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of our stock and another in which nonemployee directors officers key employees consultants and all other employees may be granted options to purchase shares of our stock restricted stock units and other types of equity awards for the past several years except for the retroactively priced stock options stock options have generally been granted at market price of our common stock on the date of grant generally have a vesting period of five 

  

years and are exercisable for a period not to exceed seven years ten years for options granted prior to july 1 2005 from the date of issuance restricted stock units may be granted with varying criteria such as timebased or performancebased vesting substantially all of our employees that meet established performance goals and qualify as key employees participate in our main equity incentive plan 

on october 18 2004 the company’s stockholders approved the 2004 equity incentive plan the “2004 plan” which provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of the company’s common stock stock appreciation rights restricted stock performance shares performance units and deferred stock units to our employees consultants and members of our board of directors since the adoption of the 2004 plan no further grants are permitted under the 1982 stock option plan or 2000 nonstatutory stock option plan the 2004 plan permits the issuance of 12500000 shares of common stock of which 63 million shares are available for grant as of june 30 2006 at that date awards for 304 million shares are outstanding under all plans 

stockbased compensation expense 

effective july 1 2005 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r establishes accounting for stockbased awards exchanged for employee services accordingly stockbased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the fair value of the award which is computed using a blackscholes option valuation model and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period 

during fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 165 million 37 million and 53 million respectively of which 22 million 34 million and 53 million was attributable to the restatements 

compensation expense recognized for all stock options for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 was 141 million 35 million and 53 million respectively as of june 30 2006 the unrecognized stockbased compensation after estimated forfeitures related to stock options was 223 million and is expected to be recognized over an estimated weightedaverage amortization period of 33 years 

compensation expense recognized in connection with the employee stock purchase plan for fiscal year 2006 was 16 million the majority of which is included in selling general and administration expense as the plan was noncompensatory under apb opinion no 25 no compensation expense was recorded in connection with the plan in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 

compensation expense recognized for restricted stock units for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 was 8 million and 2 million respectively no compensation expense was recognized in fiscal year 2004 as of june 30 2006 the unrecognized stockbased compensation after estimated forfeitures related to restricted stock units was 26 million that cost is expected to be recognized over an estimated weightedaverage amortization period of 37 years

on october 11 2006 we acquired all of the shares of ade corporation “ade” a supplier of semiconductor process control solutions per the amended merger agreement between the company and ade we paid 482 million which included goodwill and intangibles of 262 million and 137 million respectively in cash to the shareholders of ade the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase 

  

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june 30 2006 in millions 

 

 we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse during the years ended june 30 2006 and 2005 approximately 278 million and 306 million of receivables were sold under these arrangements respectively 

in addition from time to time we will discount without recourse letters of credit “lcs” received from customers in payment of goods during the years ended june 30 2006 and 2005 several lcs were sold with proceeds totaling 69 million and 30 million respectively discounting fees were 08 million and 02 million for the years ended june 30 2006 and 2005 respectively 

we maintain 25 million of shortterm credit facilities in various locations to fund overdraft custom’s guarantee for vat and letter of credit needs of our subsidiaries in europe and asia a total of 20 million was outstanding under these facilities as of june 30 2006 

we maintain certain purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecast timehorizon can vary among different suppliers we estimate our purchase commitment as of june 30 2006 to be approximately 210 million most of which we expect to spend in fiscal year 2007 actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition the amounts paid under these arrangements may change in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 

we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited or no historical product performance to estimate warranty expense more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates nonstandard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months see note 12 to consolidated financial statements “commitments and contingencies” for a detailed description 

we are involved in several litigation cases as described in note 12 to consolidated financial statements we cannot predict the outcome of these cases and we cannot estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse results 

working capital increased to 25 billion as of june 30 2006 compared to 23 billion at june 30 2005 at june 30 2006 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 23 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity 

  

provided by existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under our foreigncurrency risk management strategy we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates this financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we continue our policy of hedging our current and anticipated foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to twelve months at june 30 2006 we had cash flow hedge contracts maturing throughout fiscal year 2007 to sell 1675 million and purchase 152 million in foreign currency primarily in japanese yen at june 30 2006 we had other foreign currency hedge contracts maturing throughout fiscal year 2007 to sell 2602 million and purchase 1284 million in foreign currency primarily in japanese yen

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency hedges we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at june 30 2006 actual results may differ materially 

as of june 30 2006 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 12 billion excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents detail of these securities is included in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 from levels as of june 30 2006 the fair value of the portfolio would decline by 7 million 

as of june 30 2006 we had net forward contracts to sell 284 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in note 13 to consolidated financial statements under “derivative instruments” if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2006 the us dollar equivalent would be 288 million a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 39 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure should have no material impact on income or cash flows

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend special committee investigation of historical stock option practices 

on may 22 2006 the wall street journal published an article about stock option backdating that questioned the stock option practices at several companies including klatencor on may 23 2006 the company received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office for the northern district of california “usao” and a letter of inquiry from the united states securities and exchange commission “sec” regarding the company’s stock option practices later on may 23 2006 the board of directors appointed a special committee composed solely of independent directors to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the company’s historical stock option practices the special committee promptly engaged independent legal counsel and accounting experts to assist with the investigation the investigation included an extensive review of the company’s historical stock option practices accounting policies accounting records supporting documentation email communications and other documentation as well as interviews of a number of current and former directors officers and employees on september 27 2006 the special committee reported the bulk of its findings and recommendations to the board of directors 

findings and remedial actions 

on september 28 2006 the company announced that it would have to restate its previously issued financial statements to correct its past accounting for stock options as a result of the special committee investigation the company discovered that certain of its stock options primarily those granted from july 1 1997 to june 30 2002 had been retroactively priced for all employees who received these grants this means that the option exercise price was not the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date of the option but instead was a lower market price on an earlier date the actual grant date—when the essential actions necessary to grant the option were completed including the final determination of the number of shares to be granted to each employee and the exercise price—is the correct measurement date to determine the market price of the option shares under the accounting rules in effect at the time more than 95 of the total inthemoney value market price on the actual grant date minus exercise price of all of the company’s retroactively priced options was attributable to those granted from july 1 1997 to june 30 2002 

the company previously applied accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” through its fiscal year ended june 30 2005 under apb opinion no 25 a noncash stockbased compensation expense was required to be recognized for any option for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual grant date because each of the company’s retroactively priced options had an exercise price below the market price on the actual grant date there should have been a noncash charge for each of these options under apb opinion no 25 equal to the number of option shares multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the actual grant date that expense should have been amortized over the vesting period of the option starting in its fiscal year ended june 30 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” as a result beginning in fiscal year 2006 the additional stockbased compensation expense required to be recorded for each retroactively priced option is equal to the incremental fair value of the option on the actual grant date amortized over the remaining vesting period of the option the company did not record these stockbased compensation expenses under apb opinion no 25 or sfas no 123r related to its retroactively priced options in the company’s previously issued financial statements and that is why it is restating them in this filing to correct the company’s past accounting for stock options it recorded additional pretax noncash stockbased compensation expense of a 348 million for the periods from july 1 1994 to 

  

june 30 2005 under apb opinion no 25 and b 22 million for the year ended june 30 2006 under sfas no 123r the company expects to amortize an additional 6 million of such pretax charges under sfas no 123r in future periods to properly account for past retroactively priced stock options 

by october 16 2006 the special committee had substantially completed its investigation the special committee concluded that 1 there was retroactive pricing of stock options granted to all employees who received options primarily during the periods from july 1 1997 to june 30 2002 less than 15 of these options were granted to executive officers 2 the retroactively priced options were not accounted for correctly in the company’s previously issued financial statements 3 the retroactive pricing of options was intentional not inadvertent or through administrative error 4 the retroactive pricing of options involved the selection of fortuitously low exercise prices by certain former executive officers and other former executives may have been aware of this conduct 5 the retroactive pricing of options involved the falsification of company records resulting in erroneous statements being made in financial and other reports previously filed with the sec as well as in information previously provided to the company’s independent registered public accounting firm and 6 in most instances the retroactive pricing of options violated the terms of the company’s stock option plans because virtually all holders of retroactively priced options issued by the company were not involved in or aware of the retroactive pricing the board of directors decided that the company should continue to honor the options that violated the terms of the company’s stock option plans except in certain individual cases as described below 

the special committee concluded that with a few immaterial exceptions the retroactive pricing of stock options stopped after june 30 2002 after that time there were procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that stock options were priced on the grant date the special committee also concluded that none of the company’s independent directors was involved in or aware of the retroactive pricing of stock options based on the special committee’s report the board of directors concluded that no current members of management were involved in the retroactive pricing of stock options during its investigation of the company’s historical stock option practices the special committee did not find evidence of any other financial reporting or accounting issues 

as a result of the special committee investigation on october 16 2006 the company terminated its employment relationship and agreement with kenneth l schroeder and the company announced its intent to cancel all outstanding stock options held by mr schroeder that were retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted those options were canceled in december 2006 mr schroeder was the company’s chief executive officer and a member of its board of directors from mid1999 until january 1 2006 and was a member of the company’s stock option committee from 1994 until december 31 2005 from january 1 2006 to october 16 2006 mr schroeder was employed as a senior advisor to the company on november 10 2006 mr schroeder’s counsel informed the company that mr schroeder contests the company’s right to terminate his employment relationship and agreement and to cancel any of his options the company intends to vigorously defend any claims that may be made by mr schroeder regarding these matters which could involve a material amount 

also on october 16 2006 stuart j nichols vice president and general counsel resigned mr nichols and the company entered into a separation agreement and general release under which mr nichols’ outstanding retroactively priced stock options have been repriced by increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date under sfas no 123r no incremental charge will be recognized in the financial statements for the quarter ended december 31 2006 

on october 16 2006 kenneth levy founder and chairman of the board of directors of the company retired as a director and employee and was named chairman emeritus by the company’s board of directors mr levy and the company entered into a separation agreement and general release under which mr levy’s outstanding retroactively priced stock options have been repriced by increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date under sfas no 123r no incremental charge will be recognized in the financial statements for the quarter ended december 31 2006 mr levy was the company’s 

  

chief executive officer from 1975 until mid1999 with the exception of mid1997 to mid1998 was a member of the company’s board of directors from 1975 until his retirement was chairman of the board of directors from 1999 until his retirement and was a member of the company’s stock option committee from 1994 until use of that committee was suspended in the fall of 2006 

on december 21 2006 jon d tompkins resigned as a director of the company and the company agreed to modify the outstanding options held by mr tompkins all of which were fully vested to extend the posttermination exercisability period to december 31 2007 which is the last day of the calendar year in which those options would have terminated in the absence of such extension mr tompkins the chief executive officer of tencor instruments before its merger into the company in mid1997 was the company’s chief executive officer from mid1997 to mid1998 was a member of the company’s stock option committee from mid1997 until mid1999 and was a member of the company’s board of directors from mid1997 until his resignation 

although the board of directors concluded that john h kispert the company’s president and chief operating officer was not involved in and was not aware of the improper stock option practices based on the special committee’s recommendation his outstanding retroactively priced options have been repriced because he served as chief financial officer during part of the period in question this repricing involved increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date under sfas no 123r no incremental charge will be recognized in the financial statements for the quarter ended december 31 2006 

restatement and impact on financial statements 

this annual report on form 10k includes restatements of the following previously filed financial statements and data and related disclosures 1 the company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended june 30 2005 and 2004 2 the company’s selected consolidated financial data as of and for the fiscal years ended june 30 2005 2004 2003 and 2002 and 3 the company’s unaudited quarterly financial data for the first three quarters in our fiscal year ended june 30 2006 and for all quarters in our fiscal year ended june 30 2005 as a result of the restatements the related disclosures included in the notes to consolidated financial statements have been revised if indicated as restated 

the total effect of the restatements up through june 30 2005 resulted in pretax noncash stockbased compensation charges in the amount of 348 million under apb opinion no 25 effective july 1 2005 the company adopted sfas no 123r the grant date fair values of stock options granted prior to the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 were changed as a result of the findings that certain stock option grants were retroactively priced this change resulted in additional stockbased compensation expense of 22 million and a related tax benefit of 12 million being recognized in fiscal year 2006 under sfas no 123r 

in addition the company evaluated the impact of the restatements on its global tax provision the company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in multiple tax jurisdictions around the world in certain jurisdictions including but not limited to the united states and the united kingdom the company is able to claim a tax deduction relative to stock options in those jurisdictions where a tax deduction is claimed the company has recorded deferred tax assets totaling 516 million at june 30 2005 to reflect future tax deductions to the extent the company believes such assets to be recoverable the company also believes that it should not have taken a united states tax deduction in prior years for stock option related amounts pertaining to certain executives under internal revenue code irc section 162m section 162m limits the deductibility of compensation above certain thresholds the company has determined that excess deductions were taken on prior tax returns due to the finding that retroactive pricing of certain stock options occurred as a result the company’s tax liabilities have increased by approximately 8 million 

because virtually all holders of retroactively priced options issued by the company were not involved in or aware of the retroactive pricing the company has taken and intends to take certain actions to deal with the adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of retroactively priced options the adverse tax consequences are that retroactively priced stock options vesting after december 31 2004 “409a affected 

  

options” subject the option holder to a penalty tax under irc section 409a and as applicable similar penalty taxes under california and other state tax laws one such action by the company is to offer to amend the 409a affected options to increase the exercise price to the market price on the actual grant date or if lower the market price at the time of the amendment the amended options would not be subject to taxation under irc section 409a under irs regulations these option amendments had to be completed by december 31 2006 for anyone who was an executive officer when he or she received 409a affected options the amendments for nonofficers cannot be offered until after this report is filed and do not need to be completed until december 31 2007 another action is to approve bonuses payable to holders of the amended options to compensate them for the resulting increase in their option exercise price the amount of these bonuses would be effectively repaid to the company if and when the options are exercised and the increased exercise price is paid but there is no assurance that the options will be exercised finally the company intends to compensate certain option holders who have already exercised 409a affected options for the additional taxes they incur under irc section 409a and as applicable similar state tax laws 

three of the company’s option holders were subject to the december 31 2006 deadline described above accordingly in december 2006 the company offered to amend the 409a affected options held by richard p wallace the company’s chief executive officer and two former executive officers to increase the exercise price so that these options will not subject the option holder to a penalty tax under irc section 409a all three individuals accepted the company’s offer in addition the company agreed to pay each of the three individuals a cash bonus in january 2008 equal to the aggregate increase in the exercise prices for his amended options for mr wallace the amount of this bonus is 04 million the company plans to take similar actions with respect to the outstanding 409a affected options granted to nonofficers as soon as possible after the filing of this report the company estimates that the total cash payments needed to deal with the adverse tax consequences of retroactively priced options granted to nonofficers will be approximately 30 million 

with respect to the individuals whose options were canceled or repriced by the company following the special committee investigation no bonuses of the type described above will be paid 

remediation of past material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 

a material weakness is a control deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected 

as a result of the special committee investigation the company identified certain material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting in periods ending prior to june 30 2006 before june 30 2002 the company did not have sufficient safeguards in place to monitor its control practices regarding stock option pricing and related financial reporting and to foster an effective flow of information between those responsible for stock option pricing and those responsible for financial reporting inadequate training communication and coordination in and among the company’s human resources stock administration legal and finance functions prevented the company from assuring that stock options were priced and accounted for correctly primarily from july 1 1997 to june 30 2002 

in addition the stock option pricing process during that time period was overly dependent on certain former executive officers of the company and was administered by a stock option committee that was not always properly constituted and sometimes acted outside the scope of the authority delegated to it by the company’s board of directors the individual who served as the company’s chief executive officer during part of that time period and continuing until midway through the last fiscal year was involved in the past retroactive pricing of stock options to that extent the material weaknesses in the company’s internal control over financial reporting continued until midway through the company’s fiscal year ended june 30 2006 however no issues regarding stock option pricing and accounting arose during the last fiscal year 

  

since mid2002 the company has made a number of important changes in its controls related to granting pricing and accounting for stock options in addition the company’s board of directors elected a new management team and approved new procedures for approving stock options and other equity awards these changes including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 the company believes that these changes remediated the past material weaknesses identified above and reduced to remote the likelihood that any retroactive pricing of stock options or any material error in accounting for stock options would not have been detected as of june 30 2006 as a result the company believes that the likelihood that a material error in its financial statements that could have originated during the last fiscal year and would not have been detected as of june 30 2006 was remote

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the ceo and cfo the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation the company’s management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2006 the assessment by the company’s management of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2006 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears on page 101 of this report 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

industry 

general background 

the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer —a round disk that is six eight or twelve inches in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers and polished to a mirror finish on the side where the circuits are made 

the manufacturing cycle of integrated circuits is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and photomask or reticle generation the fabrication of an ic or “chip” is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators the deposition 

of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require over 500 individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper structure typically consisting of “interconnect” circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure 

when all of the layers on the wafer have been completed each die on the wafer is then tested for functionality the wafer is placed on a prober that is used to attach the inputoutput pins of the device to a tester when chips are tested on the wafer it is called sort test sort test determines which chips are good the wafer is then cut up and the good die are bonded to lead frames that contain pins used to attach the chip to the outside printed circuit board wires are bonded from the inputoutput pads of the ic to the pins of the leadframe then the lead frame is encapsulated in packages typically made of plastic or ceramic materials the packaged parts are put through a final test and then shipped to customers this entire packaging and testing process is called the “back end” 

current trends 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with one key new technology or market trend such as a specific design rule shrink in today’s market the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in bringing a multitude of new technologies into production at the same time including copper interconnects new substrate and transistor materials advanced lithography techniques and 300mm 12inch wafers 

while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have impacted their adoption into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects while device performance characteristics namely speed or capacity become more sensitive to such parameters as linewidth and film thickness variation copper introduces new physical defects which are harder to find within the interconnect structure as well as electrical defects which cannot be detected using conventional optical inspection systems new process materials like lowk dielectrics silicononinsulator “soi” and 193nm photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be made manufacturable larger 300mm wafers are more susceptible to damage than 200mm wafers since they can bend or bow twice as much creating stress on the wafer that can result in yield loss film uniformity is also more difficult to maintain on these larger wafers moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face since technical challenges in bringing any one of these into production could also slow the adoption of the other technologies 

the focus of our activities has been the development of new process control and yield management tools that enable chipmakers to accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into fullvolume production while minimizing their associated risks with our portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in a position to be a key supplier for comprehensive yield management solutions that enable our customers to achieve success for their nextgeneration products 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller linewidth geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the cost and performance requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 3 billion a substantial increase over the cost of previousgeneration facilities as a result chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment 

our process control and yield management equipment enables our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment “roi”—helping them to become lowcost producers 

our process control and yield acceleration solutions 

accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing the production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing achieving higher yields faster along with higher performance characteristics increases the revenue a manufacturer can obtain from each semiconductor wafer our systems are used to analyze product and process quality at critical points in the wafer photomask and ic manufacturing process and provide feedback to our customers so that fabrication problems can be identified addressed and eliminated this ability to locate the source of defects and other process issues as well as contain them enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes as well as increase their yields and device value—thus maximizing their roi and lowering their manufacturing costs 

the following are some of the methods used to accelerate yields and optimize device performance all of which require the capture and analysis of data gathered through many measurements 

the most significant opportunities for yield and device performance improvement generally occur either when production is started at new factories or technology shifts in existing factories equipment that helps a manufacturer quickly increase new product yields and optimize device performance enables the manufacturer to offer these new products in high volumes early in the product lifecycle—the time when they are likely to generate the greatest profits

 software and other 

yield management software solutions 

our productivity and analysis software systems translate raw inspection and metrology data into patterns that reveal process problems and help semiconductor manufacturers develop longterm yield improvement strategies 

klarity defect® is our automated inline defect analysis module and defect data management system designed to help fabs achieve faster yield learning cycles by identifying excursions in real time klarity defect enables fabs to embed expert decisionmaking processes within analysis recipes these processes are automatically triggered when userspecified events occur in addition to freeing fab engineers from repetitive analysis tasks this capability dramatically improves fab operating efficiency by providing relevant information in less time and with less effort for faster identification of yield problems 

our klarity ace yield analysis software enables fast integration correlation and analysis of yield and processrelated data to accurately determine the source of defects and process excursions it can differentiate between random and systematic yield problems providing users with the data they need in order to take appropriate corrective measures 

in fiscal year 2005 we introduced klarity ssa spatial signature analysis a new software capability that provides automated classification and root cause analysis of spatial signatures which are defect clusters and patterns that can be indicative of an outofspec process or process tool problem klarity ssa can be utilized for a variety of applications where enhanced excursion detection is needed including process line and tool monitoring as well as engineering analysis across key process modules 

with our acquisition of finle technologies in 2000 we developed our klarity prodata lithography data analysis software which along with our prolith lithography and etch simulation software helps manufacturers reduce their advanced lithography development time and cost as well as optimize their designfor–manufacturing “dfm” efforts 

our impact xp ™ automated defect classification “adc” software provides consistent and accurate classification of yieldlimiting defects to help our customers accelerate their ramp to higher process yields impact xp incorporates our smartgallery ™ tool which reduces the setup time associated with adc implementation in fabs this is a critical requirement particularly for foundries and application specific integrated circuit “asic” manufacturers who specialize in short runs of multiple products our real time classification ™ “rtc” and iadc technologies which provide classification and binning of defect types in real time during inspection are critical features on all of our latestgeneration ebeam and optical inspection tools 

data storage industry 

outside the semiconductor industry we manufacture sell and service yield management solutions to the data storage market with offerings for hard disk drive and component makers in the frontend of thin film head wafer manufacturing we provide the same process control equipment with which we serve the semiconductor industry with particular strength in photolithography control in the backend of head manufacturing we are the leading provider of a range of test equipment including flyheight and head resonance testers cdsems and highresolution surface profilers in hard disk media manufacturing our candela products with osa technology for both opaque and transparent films and substrates provide inspection systems optimized for the data storage industry additionally we are leveraging our expertise in magnetics to meet customers’ needs in the emerging magnetic random access memory “mram” market 

customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout the united states europe asiapacific and japan staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers leading semiconductor manufacturers from each of these regions in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues in 2003 one customer intel corporation accounted for 11 of our total revenues 

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are focused on building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility found when dealing with a single supplier our revenues are derived primarily from product sales principally through our direct sales force 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in the united states europe asiapacific and japan we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to fully meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2005 we employed over 3000 sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of whollyowned subsidiaries or branches of united states subsidiaries in a variety of countries including china france germany india israel italy japan south korea malaysia singapore taiwan thailand and the united kingdom international revenues accounted for approximately 76 77 and 69 of our total revenues in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for the sale of yield management services in process monitoring equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region especially taiwan china japan and south korea and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country the revenues from our international business may also be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates although we attempt to manage the currency risk inherent in nondollar sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our backlog for system shipments and associated warranty totaled 646 million at june 30 2005 we include in our backlog only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within twelve months from the date of order orders for service and nonreleased products are excluded from the backlog we expect to fill the present backlog of orders during fiscal year 2006 however all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and to cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 

research and development 

the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to 

research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs as part of our customer relationships we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby our customers offset certain of our research and development costs as of june 30 2005 we employed approximately 1161 research and development personnel 

our key research and development activities during fiscal year 2005 involved development of process control and yield management equipment especially reticle inspection and advanced wafer inspection for smaller feature sizes copperbased devices and 300mm wafers for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

in order to make continuing developments in the semiconductor industry we are committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development new product introductions may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses on occasion we have experienced reliability and quality problems in connection with certain product introductions resulting in some of these consequences there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be affected adversely 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in san jose and milpitas california with additional operations in san diego and hayward california and migdal ha’emek israel as of june 30 2005 we employed approximately 891 manufacturing personnel 

many of the parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” are standard commercial products although certain parts are made to our specifications we use numerous vendors to supply parts for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts by monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers and by ensuring adequate inventories of key parts are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than us such as applied materials inc and hitachi electronics engineering co ltd we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability installed base and technical service and support we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes thereby enhancing productivity 

management believes that we are well positioned with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions 

we continuously evaluate a course of strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies possible writedowns of impaired assets and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition additional information regarding business combinations during fiscal year 2005 can be found in note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secrets we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue to pursue the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection of patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted hereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

employees 

as of june 30 2005 we employed approximately 5500 persons none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements which involve risk and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed the company’s related disclosure in this annual report on form 10k the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows 

revenue recognition   we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sale price is fixed or determinable delivery has occurred or services rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured system revenue includes hardware and software that is incidental to the product we generally recognize system revenue upon positive affirmation by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications this positive affirmation is generally evidenced by an acceptance document signed by the customer in limited cases we deviate from the need for written acceptance and recognize system revenue upon shipment these exceptions have accounted for approximately 66 49 and 31 of our revenue for the fiscal years ended 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in revenue exceptions results from multiple shipments of same tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria to customers who are looking to expand capacity see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements under “revenue recognition” for detailed description of exceptions shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of revenues 

revenue from software license fees is typically recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable the fee is fixed or determinable and vendorspecific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of services andor upgrades if vendorspecific objective evidence does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement all revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist or until all elements are delivered whichever is earlier in instances where an arrangement to deliver software requires significant modification or customization license fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting allowances are established for potential product returns and credit losses 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract if maintenance is included in an arrangement which includes a software license agreement amounts related to maintenance are allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed 

the deferred system profit balance as of june 30 2005 was 210 million this amount equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs the deferred profit balance decreased from 285 million at june 30 2004 primarily because shipments were lower than customer acceptance for which revenue was recognized during fiscal year 2005 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences the unearned revenue balance increased to 80 million at june 30 2005 from 57 million at june 30 2004 primarily due to an increase in service contracts as our installed base of equipment at customers’ sites continues to increase 

inventory reserves we review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis for production inventory our methodology involves matching our onhand and onorder inventory with our build forecast over the next twelve months we then evaluate the parts found to be in excess of the twelvemonth demand and take appropriate reserves to reflect the risk of obsolescence for spare parts inventory we match our onhand inventory against twentyfour months of usage we then evaluate the parts in excess of the twentyfour month usage and take appropriate reserves to reflect risk of obsolescence both methodologies are significantly affected by the usage assumption the longer the time period of estimated usage the lower the reserves are required based on our past experience we believe the twelvemonthtwentyfour month time periods best reflect the reasonable and relative obsolescence risks if actual demand or usage were to be substantially lower than estimated additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 

allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed periodically to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change and the financial condition of our customers were adversely affected resulting in their inability to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to take additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

warranty we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to cost of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses utilizing actual service records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge we update these estimated charges every quarter the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty 

reserves accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions for which there is limited or no historical product performance on which to base the estimated warranty expense more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates nonstandard warranty generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months nonstandard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences 

contingencies and litigation we are named from time to time as a party to various legal proceedings while we currently believe the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict we would accrue the cost of an adverse judgment if in our estimation the adverse settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the ultimate cost to us we have made no such accruals as of june 30 2005 

income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas no 109 which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities sfas no 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 

executive summary 

klatencor corporation is the world’s leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries our portfolio of products software analysis services and expertise is designed to help integrated circuit manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire wafer fabrication process – from research and development to final mass production yield analysis 

net sales income from operations net income cash flow from operations and diluted earnings per share are the key indicators we use to monitor our financial condition and operating performance we also use certain nongaap measures such as net orders to assess business trends and performance and to forecast and plan future operations net orders consist of current period orders less current period cancellations the following table sets forth the key quarterly financial information which we use to manage our business in millions except per share data 

 outlook 

the semiconductor industry grew almost 30 while the semiconductor equipment industry grew 60 in calendar year 2004 analysts are forecasting semiconductor revenue growth to slow to approximately 5 and semiconductor equipment revenues to decline by approximately 5 in calendar year 2005 new system and service orders on a fiscal basis which are new orders net of cancellations declined sequentially by approximately 198 million or 10 in the year ended june 30 2005 compared to the previous fiscal year due to nearterm weakness in demand for semiconductor capital equipment 

over the longer term we expect process control to continue to represent a higher percentage of our customers’ capital spending we believe this increase in process control spending will be driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes the transition to copper and other new materials and the transition to new 300millimeter fabs we anticipate these factors will drive increased demand for our products and services 

new system and service net orders by region were as follows in millions 

   29 

orders received in a particular quarter affect revenue recognized in subsequent quarters net orders turn to revenue upon positive affirmation by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications our backlog for unshipped system orders as of june 30 2005 was approximately 646 million a majority of which we expect to ship over the next six to nine months in addition as of june 30 2005 there was 531 million that is related to products that have been delivered but are awaiting written acceptance from the customer 

results of operations 

revenues and gross margin 

 product revenues 

product revenue in fiscal year 2005 increased 570 million or 48 to 18 billion from 12 billion in fiscal year 2004 product revenue in fiscal year 2004 increased 140 million or 13 to 12 billion from 11 billion in fiscal year 2003 product revenue increases in fiscal year 2005 and 2004 were primarily the result of fulfilling higher level of orders received in prior periods as a result of increased capital spending by our customers our customers’ increased capital spending in the area of process control and yield management is due to the increasing complexity of processing in their fabs as more complex chips are produced new materials such as copper are introduced and device feature sizes are reduced 

service revenues 

service revenue in fiscal year 2005 increased 18 million or 6 to 315 million from 297 million in fiscal year 2004 service revenue in fiscal year 2004 increased 34 million or 13 to 297 million from 263 million in fiscal year 2003 service revenue is generated from maintenance service contracts as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period service revenue continued to increase in absolute terms throughout the three year period as our installed base of equipment at our customers’ sites continued to grow the amount of service revenue generated is generally a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the degree of utilization of those systems 

revenues by region 

revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows in millions 

 international revenues were 76 77 and 69 of revenue during the fiscal years ended june 30 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively a significant portion of our revenue continues to be generated outside the united states where a significant portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located 

gross margin 

gross margin improved by 4 points to 59 during fiscal year 2005 from 55 during fiscal year 2004 gross margin improved by 6 points to 55 during fiscal year 2004 from 49 during fiscal year 2003 the improvement over the last two fiscal years can be attributed to the lower cost of building installing and maintaining our products combined with an increase in our revenues our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products 

engineering research and development “rd” 

 net rd expenses increased 59 million or 21 to 340 million during fiscal year 2005 from 281 million during fiscal year 2004 net rd expenses increased 13 million or 5 to 281 million during fiscal year 2004 from 268 million during fiscal year 2003 

the gross dollars for rd investment were partially offset by 8 million 11 million and 18 million of external funding received during the fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively for certain strategic development programs conducted with several of our customers and from government grants 

the businesses acquired during this fiscal year contributed 23 million of the increase in net rd expenses during fiscal year 2005 for more information on the business combinations completed during fiscal year 2005 see note 5 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements at item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report the reduction in rd expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year 2005 compared to the prior fiscal year was driven by our continued focus on cost reduction initiatives and by the increase in revenues we expect our net rd expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development efforts we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes 

selling general and administrative “sga” 

 sga expenses increased 51 million or 21 to 300 million during fiscal year 2005 from 249 million during the fiscal year 2004 sga expenses decreased 5 million or 2 to 249 million during fiscal year 2004 from 254 million during the fiscal year 2003 

the increase in sga expenses compared to the prior fiscal year is due to an increase in customer application support increased staffing stock based compensation expense and consolidating the results of operations of the entities acquired during the quarter the businesses acquired during this fiscal year contributed 10 million of the increase in sga expenses during fiscal year 2005 for more information on the business combinations completed during fiscal year 2005 see note 5 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements at item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report also stockbased compensation expense was 3 million for fiscal year 2005 compared to none in prior periods the reduction in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was driven by our continued focus on cost reduction initiatives and by the increase in revenues we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we build up our organization to meet increased customer demands 

the absolute dollars for selling general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 primarily due to company mandated timeoff reductions in labor and discretionary spending as well as other cost saving measures implemented over fiscal years 2004 and 2003 in response to the industry slowdown 

restructuring and other costs 

there were no restructuring actions in fiscal year 2005 or 2004 in fiscal year 2003 klatencor restructured certain of its operations to realign costs with planned business levels in light of the industry downturn restructuring costs were classified into two main categories facilities and other charges of 46 million and severance and benefits of 11 million as part of the facilities consolidation klatencor exited several of its leased buildings and has included the remaining net book value of the related leasehold improvements as well as the future lease payments net of anticipated sublease revenue in the charge 

severance and benefit charges were related to the involuntary termination of approximately 70 employees from manufacturing engineering sales marketing and administration in the united states japan and europe the restructuring actions taken in fiscal year 2003 are proceeding as planned with the termination of employees having been completed and the facilities related lease payments expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2006 in addition during the first fiscal quarter of 2003 klatencor received 152 million as a second and final installment on the sale of software and intellectual property associated with its isupport™ online customer support technology which was netted against the above nonrecurring charges resulting in a reported net gain of 94 million in addition to the restructuring action klatencor also recorded severance charges totaling 109 million in operating expenses throughout fiscal year 2003 relating to a series of involuntary employee terminations 

the annual estimated cost savings from the restructuring actions incurred prior to fiscal year 2004 was 9 million of which 7 million related to workforce reductions and 2 million related to consolidation of facilities and was not expected to have a material effect on our cost of goods sold or operating expenses there were no material variances between the actual and anticipated costs of restructuring as of june 30 2004 the remaining accrual balance was 821000 during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 the company made lease payments of 632000 related to the exited facilities as of june 30 2005 the remaining accrual balance of 189000 is related to lease payments on facilities exited prior to fiscal year 2004 and is expected to be paid by the end of fiscal year 2006 this remaining accrual is included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption of other current liabilities 

interest income and other net 

 interest income and other net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on the investment and cash portfolio realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities as well as income recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 253 25 and 24 in fiscal year 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively in general our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35 largely as a function of benefits realized from our extraterritorial income “eti” exclusion research and development tax credits and tax exempt interest 

the fiscal year 2005 effective tax rate of 253 includes the reinstatement of the federal rd credit which yielded a benefit of 172 million or approximately 3 the tax rate for fiscal year 2005 is favorably impacted by variances between the fiscal year 2004 tax return and the tax provision for that fiscal year 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income non taxdeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions amounts of taxexempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 

the internal revenue service commenced an audit of the company’s fiscal year 2003 and 2004 corporate tax returns liabilities for anticipated worldwide tax audit issues have been established based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable the company believes that adequate reserves have been provided to cover any potential additional tax assessments 

equity incentive program 

our equity incentive program is a broadbased longterm retention program that is intended to attract and retain qualified management and technical employees “knowledge employees” and align stockholder and employee interests the equity incentive program consists of two plans one under which nonemployee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of our stock and another in which nonemployee directors officers key employees consultants and all other employees may be granted options to purchase shares of our stock restricted stock units and other types of equity awards under our equity incentive program stock options generally have a vesting period of five years are exercisable for a period not to exceed ten years from the date of issuance and are generally granted at prices not less than the fair market value of our common stock at the grant date restricted stock units may be granted with varying criteria such as time based or performance based vesting substantially all of our employees that meet established performance goals and that qualify as knowledge employees participate in our main equity incentive plan 

on october 18 2004 the company’s stockholders approved the 2004 equity incentive plan the “omnibus plan” which provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of the company’s common stock stock appreciation rights restricted stock performance shares performance units and deferred stock units to our employees consultants and members of our board of directors this new plan replaces future grants under the 1982 stock option plan and 2000 nonstatutory stock option plan and supplements the 1998 outside director option plan the shareholder approval included the creation of a reserve establishment of 11000000 shares of common stock for use under the plan and the ability to transfer up to an additional 1500000 shares of forfeited or expired stock under the 1982 stock option plan and the 2000 nonstatutory plan 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 the following actions were taken with regard to the new equity incentive plan a a reserve of 11000000 shares was established b 1465853 shares were added to the reserve from the 1982 stock option plan and the 2000 nonstatutory plan due to forfeitures or expiration c the 1982 stock option plan was terminated as a result 12358625 shares expired d the 2000 nonstatutory plan was terminated and as a result 3447748 shares expired e the 1993 stock option plan was terminated as a result 3500 shares expired and f the metrology stock option plan was terminated as a result 4238 shares expired 

the following table summarizes the combined activity under the equity incentive plans for the indicated periods 

  35 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 our board of directors approved the grant of 406960 shares respectively of restricted stock units to selected members of our senior management these restricted stock units generally vest in two equal installments on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant we recorded the 164 million value of these restricted stock unit grants as a component of shareholders’ equity and will amortize that amount over the service period the value of the restricted stock unit awards was based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of award amortization expense for these awards for the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 was 23 million the majority of which is included in selling general and administrative expense these restricted stock units were included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method 

liquidity and capital resources 

 we have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations cash provided by operating activities was 507 million 350 million and 246 million in fiscal year 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2005 consisted primarily of net income of 467 million increased by noncash depreciation of 71 million and increase in other current liabilities of 72 million offset by a decrease in deferred system profit of 75 million an increase in net deferred tax assets of 43 million and an increase in other assets of 33 million 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2004 consisted primarily of net income earned during the year of 244 million increases in the deferred system profit of 107 million and other current liabilities of 116 million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 149 million and an increase in inventories of 79 million 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2003 consisted primarily of net income earned during the year of 137 million increased by noncash depreciation of 71 million a decrease in accounts receivable of 53 million a decrease in inventories of 64 million partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of 19 million a decrease in deferred system profit of 16 million and an increase in other assets of 17 million 

cash used in investing activities was 158 million 321 million and 198 million in fiscal year 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities purchases of capital assets to support longterm growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new market segments or emerging technologies 

we used 81 million of cash in financing activities in fiscal year 2005 compared with 113 million and 27 million of cash generated from financing activities in fiscal year 2004 and 2003 respectively financing activities include dividend payments to our 

common stockholders and sales and repurchases of our common stock issuance of common stock provided 134 million 169 million and 92 million in fiscal year 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively we used 204 million 56 million and 66 million in fiscal year 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively to repurchase shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program initiated in 1997 during the third fiscal quarter of 2005 our board of directors also approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend and declared a dividend of 12 cents per share of our outstanding common stock payable on june 1 2005 to our stockholders of record on may 2 2005 the total amount of dividend paid during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 was 24 million further the dividend for the first fiscal quarter of 2006 was declared on august 4 2005 and is payable to our stockholders of record on august 15 2005 the total amount of dividend payable during the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 is approximately 24 million 

at june 30 2005 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 22 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors our management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant operating lease commitments as of june 30 2005 in millions 

 we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse during the years ended june 30 2005 and 2004 approximately 306 million and 166 million of receivables were sold under these arrangements respectively   

in addition from time to time we will discount without recourse letters of credit “lcs” received from customers in payment of goods during the years ended june 30 2005 and 2004 several lcs were sold with proceeds totaling 30 million and 42 million respectively discounting fees were 195000 and 215000 for the years ended june 30 2005 and 2004 respectively 

we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecast timehorizon can vary among different suppliers we estimate our open inventory purchase commitment as of june 30 2005 to be approximately 147 million actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided in addition the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or cancelled certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 

working capital increased to 23 billion as of june 30 2005 compared to 13 billion at june 30 2004 our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 

factors affecting results including risks and uncertainties 

fluctuations in operating results and stock price 

our operating results and stock price have varied widely in the past and our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon numerous factors including those listed in this section and throughout this quarterly report on form 10q our stock price will continue to be subject to daily variations as well in addition our future operating results and stock price may not follow any past trends we believe the factors that could make our results fluctuate and difficult to predict include 

 operating results also could be affected by sudden changes in customer requirements currency exchange rate fluctuations and other economic conditions affecting customer demand and the cost of operations in one or more of the global markets in which we do business as a result of these or other factors we could fail to achieve our expectations as to future revenue gross profit and income from operations our failure to meet the performance expectations set and published by external sources could result in a sudden and significant drop in the price of our stock particularly on a shortterm basis and could negatively affect the value of any investment in our stock 

implementation of new systems 

we may experience difficulties with our new enterprise resource planning “erp” system implemented as of february 7 2005 that could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of the results of our consolidated operations our financial position and cash flows any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with this new erp system or any future systems could also adversely affect our ability to complete the evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 system failure or malfunctioning may result in disruption of operations and the inability to process transactions and could adversely affect our financial results if we encounter unforeseen problems with regard to system operations or the new erp system we could be adversely affected 

semiconductor equipment industry volatility 

the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict this cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and thus future expense levels when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound during a down cycle we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

global economic uncertainty 

our business is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses the picture of enduser demand has been mixed over the last few months and visibility has been reduced as a result of high oil prices the continued threat of terrorist activities and political instability in certain regions of the world a protracted global economic slowdown may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

international trade operations and economic conditions 

we serve an increasingly global market a majority of our annual revenue is derived from outside the united states and we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue our international revenue and operations are affected by economic conditions specific to each country and region because of our significant dependence on international revenue a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business could negatively affect our operating results 

managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents challenges associated with among other things cultural diversity and organizational alignment moreover each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period periodic local or international economic downturns trade balance issues political instability or terrorism in regions where we have operations along with fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our business and results of operations although we attempt to manage nearterm currency risks through the use of hedging instruments there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate 

competition 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than us we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and service that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services similar to what we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets loss of competitive position could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenue gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business 

technological change and customer requirements 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions for example in the current semiconductor industry the size of semiconductor devices continues to shrink there is a transition to copper and other new materials and a transition to new 300millimeter fabs while we expect these trends will increase our customers’ reliance on our diagnostic products we cannot ensure that they will directly improve our business these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards to develop and introduce new products which successfully address changing customer needs to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

in this environment we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance features and functionality there can be no assurance that revenue from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future development substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products in addition we cannot ensure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

key suppliers 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for 

manufacturing we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers our business would be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and costeffective manner 

manufacturing disruption 

most of our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states with a small operation located in israel operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism fire earthquake energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers we cannot ensure that alternate production capacity would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if it were available it could be obtained on favorable terms such disruption could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business we currently are in the initial stages of design and implementation of a new integrated financial and supply chain management system disruptions or delays in making changes to our integrated financial and supply chain management system could adversely impact our operations and our ability to forecast sales demand ship products manage our product inventory and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

reliance on services provided by third parties 

we outsource a number of services including our transportation and logistics management of spare parts to domestic and overseas third party service providers while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered or our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions disruptions or delays at our thirdparty service providers due to events such as regional economic business environmental political informational technology system failures or military actions could adversely impact our operations and our ability to ship products manage our product inventory and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

intellectual property obsolescence and infringement 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our technology that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information our customary practice is to evaluate such assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms or instigation of litigation or other administrative proceedings could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

key employees 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future our business and operations could be harmed 

acquisitions 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources we also seek to acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with the integration of the operations and personnel technologies and products of the acquired companies the possible writedowns of impaired assets and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could seriously harm our business 

litigation 

from time to time we are involved in litigation of various types including litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights and other claims litigation tends to be expensive and requires significant management time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of operations or business if we lose or have to settle a case on significantly adverse terms 

terrorism and political instability 

the threat of terrorism targeted at the regions of the world in which we do business including the united states increases the uncertainty in our markets and may delay any recovery in the general economy any delay in the recovery of the economy and the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business increased international political instability as demonstrated by the september 2001 terrorist attacks disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of the terrorist attacks and the continuing instability in the middle east may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations such continuing instability could cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate this same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if this international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 

recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations 

recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies including the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 will increase our expenses as we evaluate the implications of new rules and devote resources to respond to the new requirements sarbanes oxley act mandates among other things that companies adopt new corporate governance measures and imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements sets stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for companies their chief executive officers and chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations in particular we expect to incur additional administrative expense as we implement section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act which requires management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our internal control over financial reporting in addition the nasdaq national market on which our common stock is listed has also adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance these laws rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties as a result we may have difficultly attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which would adversely affect our business 

earthquake and other uninsured risks 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain other risks are uninsurable or are insurable only at significant costs and cannot be mitigated with insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations most of which are conducted in california it could also significantly delay our research and engineering effort on new products most of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we self insure earthquake risks because we believe this is the prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also self insured either based on a similar cost benefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

future changes in accounting and taxation standards or practices 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

for example the adoption of sfas no 123r which would require us to measure all employee stockbased compensation awards using a fair value method beginning in fiscal year 2006 and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as reported under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 

exposure to various risks related to the regulatory environment 

we are subject to various risks related to new different inconsistent or even conflicting laws rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies andor regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply 

exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally we routinely hedge these exposures in an effort to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations however we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 

computer viruses may disrupt our operations 

despite our implementation of network security measures our tools and servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems and tools located at customer sites any such event could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

effects of recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r would require us to measure all employee stockbased compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements in march 2005 the sec issued sab 107 which provides the staff’s views regarding interactions between sfas no 123r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of sharebased payments for public companies the adoption of sfas no 123r will require additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from sharebased payment arrangements sfas no 123r is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the adoption of sfas no 123r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and statement of cash flows we are evaluating what pricing model to select upon adoption and the impact by financial statement line based on preliminary analysis we believe the impact on our consolidated results of operations will be similar to the proforma impact disclosed under sfas no 123 in periods prior to adoption of sfas no 123r 

in june 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” a replacement of apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and statement no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” statement 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle previously most voluntary changes in accounting principles were required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change statement 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change statement 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 however the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements the adoption of sfas no 154 is not expected have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in march 2005 the fasb published fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” which clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity the uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists the interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation this interpretation is effective no later than the end of our fiscal 2006 the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 29 sfas no 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged sfas no 153 is effective for us for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the adoption of sfas no 153 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in december 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1092 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004 the american jobs creation act introduces a special onetime dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision provided certain criteria are met fsp fas 1092 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision we completed our evaluation of the foreign earnings repatriation provisions and decided not to repatriate foreign earnings because it was not beneficial to the company 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” sfas no 151 clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges the provisions of sfas no151 are effective for the fiscal year beginning july 1 2005 the adoption of sfas no 151 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in march 2004 the emerging issues task force “eitf” reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under eitf 031 the consensus clarifies the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to investments in debt and equity securities in particular investments within the scope of sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” and investments accounted for under the cost method in september 2004 the financial accounting standards board approved the issuance of a fasb staff position to delay the requirement to record impairment losses under eitf 031 the approved delay applies to all securities within the scope of eitf 031 we will evaluate the impact of eitf 031 once the final guidance is issued

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at june 30 2005 actual results may differ materially 

at the end of fiscal year 2005 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 13 billion excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents detail of these securities is included in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 from levels as of june 30 2005 the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by 55 million 

as of june 30 2005 we had net forward contracts to sell 289 million in foreign currency in order to hedge currency exposures detail of these contracts is included in note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under “derivative instruments” if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2005 the us dollar equivalent would be 281 million a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 39 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that the hedging of our foreign currency exposure should have no material impact on income or cash flows

attached as exhibits to this annual report are certifications of the ceo and the cfo which are required in accordance with rule 13a14 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended exchange act this controls and procedures section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act disclosure controls as of the end of the period covered by this annual report required by exchange act rules 13a15b or 15d15b the controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo based on this evaluation our ceo and our cfo have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

definition of disclosure controls 

disclosure controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the exchange act such as this annual report is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls include components of our internal control over financial reporting which consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us to the extent that components of our internal control over financial reporting are included within our disclosure controls they are included in the scope of our annual controls evaluation 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2005 our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2005 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears on page 84 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

industry 

general background 

the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is six eight or twelve inches in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers and polished to a mirror finish on the side where the circuits are made 

the manufacturing cycle of integrated circuits is grouped into three phases design fabrication and testing ic design involves the architectural layout of the circuit as well as design verification and photomask or reticle generation the fabrication of an ic or “chip” is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require over 300 individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper structure typically consisting of “interconnect” circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure 

when all of the layers on the wafer have been completed each die on the wafer is then tested for functionality the wafer is placed on a prober that is used to attach the inputoutput pins of the device to a tester when chips are tested on the wafer it is called sort test sort test determines which chips are good the wafer is then cut up and the good die are bonded to lead frames that contain pins used to attach the chip to the outside printed circuit board wires are bonded from the inputoutput pads of the ic to the pins of the leadframe then the lead frame is encapsulated in packages typically made of plastic or ceramic materials the packaged part are put through a final test and then shipped to customers this entire packaging and testing process is called the “back end” 

current trends 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes as well as production are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with one key new technology or market trend such as a specific design rule shrink in today’s market the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in bringing a multitude of new technologies into production at the same time including copper interconnects new materials sub010 micron design rules and 300mm wafers the next larger wafer size from which more than twice as many ics can be produced as from 200mm wafers 

while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have slowed their adoption into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects while device performance characteristics namely speed or capacity become more sensitive to such parameters as linewidth and film thickness variation copper introduces new physical defects which are harder to find within the interconnect structure as well as electrical defects which cannot be detected using conventional optical inspection systems new process materials like lowk dielectrics silicononinsulator “soi” and 193nm photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be made manufacturable larger 300mm wafers are more susceptible to damage than 200mm wafers since they can bend or bow twice as much creating stress on the wafer that can result in yield loss film uniformity is also more difficult to maintain on these larger wafers moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face since technical challenges in bringing any one of these into production could also slow the adoption of the other technologies 

our key activities during fiscal year 2004 involved the development of new process control and yield management tools that enable chipmakers to accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into fullvolume production while minimizing their associated risks with our portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in a position to be the single source for comprehensive yield management solutions that enable our customers to achieve firsttomarket success for their nextgeneration products 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller linewidth geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the cost and performance requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 3 billion a substantial increase over the cost of previousgeneration facilities as a result chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment our process control and yield management equipment enables our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment “roi”—helping them to become lowcost producers 

our process control and yield acceleration solutions 

accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing the production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing achieving higher yields faster along with higher performance characteristics increases the revenue a manufacturer can obtain from each semiconductor wafer our systems are used to analyze product and process quality at critical points in the wafer photomask and ic manufacturing process and provide feedback to our customers so that fabrication problems can be identified addressed and eliminated this ability to locate the source of defects and other process issues as well as contain them enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes as well as increase their yields and device value—thus maximizing their roi and lowering their manufacturing costs 

the following are some of the methods used to accelerate yields and optimize device performance all of which require the capture and analysis of data gathered through many measurements 

 6 

 the most significant opportunities for yield and device performance improvement generally occur either when production is started at new factories or technology shifts in existing factories equipment that helps a manufacturer quickly increase new product yields and optimize device performance enables the manufacturer to offer these new products in high volumes early in the product lifecycle—the time when they are likely to generate the greatest profits 

products 

we operate in one operating segment for the design manufacture and marketing of process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industry we market and sell our hardware—consisting of patterned and unpatterned wafer inspection optical overlay metrology ebeam review reticle and photomask inspection spectroscopic and ebeambased cd metrology and film and surface measurement tools—as well as our advanced yield analysis and defect classification software to provide fabwide yield management solutions that are optimized for the manufacturing process cells used in ic production including lithography etch deposition and chemical mechanical planarization “cmp” our offerings can be broadly categorized into four groups defect inspection metrology customer service and support yield management software solutions and data storage in addition we provide to our customers manufacturing with older technologies refurbished klatencor certified tools along with warranty and support 

defect inspection 

our defect inspection tools are used to detect count classify and characterize particles pattern defects surface anomalies and electrical failures both inline at various manufacturing process stages and offline during engineering analysis our portfolio includes the tools necessary for our customers to detect correlate and analyze physical and electrical defects as well as determine and correct their cause

data storage industry 

outside the semiconductor industry we manufacture sell and service yield management solutions to the data storage market with offerings for hard disk drive and component makers in the frontend of thin film head wafer manufacturing we are the leading provider of the same process control equipment with which we serve the semiconductor industry with particular strength in photolithography control in the backend of head manufacturing we are the leading provider of a range of test equipment including flyheight and head resonance testers cdsems and highresolution surface profilers additionally we are leveraging our expertise in magnetics to meet customers’ needs in the emerging magnetic random access memory “mram” market 

customer service and support 

we enhance the value of our products through our customer service and support programs which provide comprehensive worldwide service and support across all of our product lines we also offer yield technology services to improve our customers’ return on investment “roi” 

 customers 

to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout the united states europe asiapacific and japan staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers leading semiconductor manufacturers from each of these regions in fiscal year 2004 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues in 2003 one customer intel corporation accounted for 11 of our total revenues in fiscal year 2002 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues 

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

sales service and marketing 

our sales service and marketing efforts are focused on building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility found when dealing with a single supplier our revenues are derived primarily from product sales principally through our direct sales force and to a lesser extent through distributors 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in the united states europe asiapacific and japan we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to fully meet the requirements of the united states departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2004 we employed over 2500 sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the united states we conduct sales marketing and services out of whollyowned subsidiaries or branches of united states subsidiaries in a variety of countries including china france germany israel italy japan south korea malaysia singapore taiwan thailand and the united kingdom international revenues accounted for approximately 77 69 and 67 of our total revenues in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for the sale of yield management services in process monitoring equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region especially taiwan china japan and south korea and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country the revenues from our international business may also be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates although we attempt to manage the currency risk inherent in nondollar sales through hedging activities there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

backlog 

our backlog for system shipments and associated warranty totaled 867 million at june 30 2004 we include in our backlog only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within twelve months we exclude from backlog orders for nonreleased products we expect to fill the present backlog of orders during fiscal year 2005 however all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and to cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 

research and development 

the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs as part of our customer relationships we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby our customers offset certain of our research and development costs 

our key research and development activities during fiscal year 2004 involved development of process control and yield management equipment especially reticle inspection and advanced wafer inspection for smaller feature sizes copperbased devices and 300mm wafers for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

in order to make continuing developments in the semiconductor industry we are committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development new product introductions may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses on occasion we have experienced reliability and quality problems in connection with certain product introductions resulting in some of these consequences there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new hardware and software products or that new hardware and software products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be affected adversely 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies 

we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in san jose and milpitas california with additional operations in san diego and hayward california and migdal ha’emek israel as of june 30 2004 we employed approximately 1100 manufacturing and 1100 engineering personnel 

many of the parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” are standard commercial products although certain parts are made to our specifications we use numerous vendors to supply parts for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts by monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers and by ensuring adequate inventories of key parts are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition 

the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than us such as applied materials inc and hitachi electronics engineering co ltd we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability installed base and technical service and support we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes thereby enhancing productivity 

our process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor industry are intended to compete based upon performance and technical capabilities these systems may compete with less expensive and more laborintensive manual inspection devices 

management believes that we are well positioned with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions 

we continuously evaluate a course of strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies possible writedowns of impaired assets and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

patents and other proprietary rights 

we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secrets we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue to pursue the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under united states and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 

although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection of patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted hereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

employees 

as of june 30 2004 we employed approximately 5200 persons none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees 










 item 2 properties 

information regarding our principal properties at june 30 2004 is set forth below 

 20 

 1 currently approximately half of the livermore california facility is being utilized for engineering manufacture and service operations 

we also lease office space for other smaller sales and service offices in several locations throughout the world our operating leases expire at various times through june 30 2015 with renewal options at the fair market value for additional periods up to five years additional information regarding these leases is incorporated by reference from note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k we believe our properties are adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and that our production facilities have capacity adequate for our current needs 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict we believe that we have a defense for the case set forth below and are vigorously contesting this matter 

on october 11 2000 ade corporation “ade” a competitor filed a patent infringement lawsuit against us in the us district court in delaware ade claimed damages and sought an injunction under us patent no 6118525 “‘525 patent” we filed a counterclaim in the same court alleging that ade has infringed four of our patents we are seeking damages and a permanent injunction against ade in addition we are seeking a declaration from the district court that the ‘525 patent is invalid on october 22 2001 we filed a separate action for declaratory judgment against ade in the northern district of california requesting a declaration that us patent no 6292259 “‘259 patent” is invalid and not infringed that action was consolidated with the prior action in the delaware proceeding and ade amended its complaint in that proceeding to allege that we are infringing the ‘259 patent on august 8 2002 the magistrate presiding over the action in the us district court in delaware issued a recommendation that the court enter summary judgment in our favor on the issue of noninfringement under ade’s ‘525 patent on the same day the magistrate issued recommendations that the court enter summary judgment in favor of ade on the issue of noninfringement of two of our patents the district court judge subsequently substantially adopted the recommendations of the magistrate regarding claims construction the district court judge has ruled in our favor and granted summary judgment of noninfringement regarding both the ‘525 and ‘259 patents we have voluntarily withdrawn one of our patents from this suit and we continued to pursue our claim that ade infringes our us patent no 6215551“‘551 patent” our case against ade’s alleged infringement of our patent went to trial on january 27 2004 and on february 4 2004 the court entered judgment in favor of ade ruling that the ‘551 patent is invalid we have filed posttrial motions and are evaluating appeals if needed 

although we cannot predict the outcome of this claim we do not believe that this legal matter will have a material adverse effect on us were an unfavorable ruling to occur there exists the possibility of a material impact on our operating results for the period in which the ruling occurred and in future periods

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements which involve risk and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed the company’s disclosure relating to them in this annual report on form 10k the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows 

revenue recognition   we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sale price is fixed or determinable delivery has occurred or services rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured system revenue includes hardware and software that is incidental to the product we generally recognize system revenue upon positive affirmation by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications this positive affirmation is generally evidenced by an acceptance document signed by the customer this change has the impact of prolonging the cycle time between order placement and revenue recognition in limited cases we allow for exceptions where we recognize system revenue upon shipment these exceptions have accounted for approximately 49 31 and 25 of our revenue for the fiscal years ended 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in revenue exceptions results from multiple shipments of same tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria to customers who are looking to expand capacity see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements under “revenue recognition” for detailed description of exceptions shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of revenues 

revenue from software license fees is typically recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable the fee is fixed or determinable and vendorspecific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement 

such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of services andor upgrades if vendorspecific objective evidence does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement all revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist or until all elements are delivered whichever is earlier in instances where an arrangement to deliver software requires significant modification or customization license fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting allowances are established for potential product returns and credit losses 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract if maintenance is included in an arrangement which includes a software license agreement amounts related to maintenance are allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed 

the deferred system profit balance as of june 30 2004 was 285 million this amount equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs the deferred profit balance increased from 177 million at june 30 2003 primarily because shipments were higher than customer acceptance for which revenue was recognized during fiscal year 2004 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences the unearned revenue balance increased to 57 million at june 30 2004 from 48 million at june 30 2003 primarily due to an increase in service contracts as our installed base of equipment at customers’ sites continues to increase 

inventory reserves we review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis for production inventory our methodology involves matching our onhand and onorder inventory with our build forecast over the next twelve months we then evaluate the parts found to be in excess of the twelvemonth demand and take appropriate reserves to reflect the risk of obsolescence for spare parts inventory we match our onhand inventory against twentyfour months of usage we then evaluate the parts in excess of the twentyfour month usage and take appropriate reserves to reflect risk of obsolescence both methodologies are significantly affected by the usage assumption the longer the time period of estimated usage the lower the reserves are required based on our past experience we believe the twelvemonthtwentyfour month time periods best reflect the reasonable and relative obsolescence risks if actual demand or usage were to be substantially lower than estimated additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 

  allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed periodically to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change and the financial condition of our customers were adversely affected resulting in their inability to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to take additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

warranty we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to cost of revenues when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses utilizing actual service records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge we update these estimated charges every quarter the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions for which there is limited or no historical product performance on which to base the estimated warranty expense more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates nonstandard warranty generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months nonstandard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences 

contingencies and litigation we are currently named as a party to various legal proceedings including those disclosed in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” in this annual report on form 10k while we currently believe the ultimate outcome of this proceeding will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict we would accrue the cost of an adverse judgment if in our estimation the adverse settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the ultimate cost to us we have made no such accruals as of june 30 2004 

income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas 109 which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities sfas 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

new system and service orders for the fiscal year ended june 30 2004 were 74 higher than the fiscal year ended june 30 2003 the growth in orders is being driven by the need of our customers to expand both 200mm and 300mm capacity advance existing capacity to nextgeneration processes increase the efficiency of already operating production lines and overcome yield and reliability problems in nextgeneration pilot lines for the fiscal year ended june 30 2003 new system and service orders were 7 lower than the fiscal year ended june 30 2002 due to the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2004 our total revenues increased approximately 13 over fiscal year ended june 30 2003 driven by increased customer demands while our service revenue continues to grow in absolute dollar terms most of the growth is being driven by increases in product revenues total revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30 2003 were approximately 19 lower than the fiscal year ended june 30 2002 this was primarily due to a decline in customer demand for our products as a result of the downturn in the semiconductor industry 

gross margins for the fiscal year ended june 30 2004 improved 6 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2003 the main reason for the increase was the lower cost of building installing and maintaining our products gross margin for the fiscal year ended june 30 2003 declined by 10 compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2002 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2004 research and development expenses were 5 higher compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2003 as we funded new product development programs for the fiscal year ended june 30 2003 research and development expenses declined 7 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2002 due to completion of several projects that resulted in reductions in labor and material expense selling general and administrative expenses decreased 2 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2004 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2003 and decreased 13 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2004 compared with the fiscal year ended june 30 2003 on account of various cost controls initiatives and reduced overhead support costs 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2004 we generated 350 million in cash flow from operations cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 19 billion as of june 30 2004 compared to 15 billion as of june 30 2003 

we intend this executive summary as well as the discussion of our financial condition results of operations and liquidity and capital resources that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how certain accounting principles policies and estimates affect our financial statements 

over the longer term we expect process control to continue to represent a higher percentage of our customers’ capital spending we believe this increase in process control spending will be driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes the transition to copper and other new materials and the transition to new 300millimeter fabs we anticipate these factors will drive increased demand for our products and services 

new system and service orders by region were as follows in millions 

  our backlog for unshipped system orders as of june 30 2004 was approximately 867 million a majority of which we expect to ship over the next six to nine months in addition we have 543 million of deferred revenue that is related to products that have been delivered but are awaiting written acceptance from the customer 

results of operations 

revenues and gross margin 

product revenue in fiscal year 2004 increased 140 million or 13 to 12 billion from 11 billion in fiscal year 2003 product revenue increases in fiscal year 2004 were primarily the result of increased capital spending which we believe was a result of the beginning of a semiconductor industry upturn product revenue in fiscal year 2003 decreased 368 million or 26 to 11 billion from 14 billion in fiscal year 2002 product revenue declines in fiscal year 2003 were primarily attributable to reduced capital spending by our customers as a result of a significant reduction in the demand for semiconductors over the last two years in fiscal year 2004 international product revenue increased to 81 of product revenue from 71 in fiscal year 2003 due to relatively higher product revenue in japan korea and asia pacific partially offset by lower product revenue in europe in fiscal year 2003 international product revenue increased slightly to 71 of product revenue from 69 in the prior year due to higher demand in taiwan 

service revenue is generated from maintenance service contracts as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period service revenues were 297 million 263 million and 209 million in fiscal year 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively service revenue continued to increase in absolute terms throughout the three year period as our installed base of equipment at our customers’ sites continued to grow the amount of service revenue generated is generally a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the degree of utilization of those systems 

as a result of the strong order growth we experienced in fiscal year 2004 which significantly increased our shipment backlog we expect product shipments to continue to increase which will result in an increase in product revenue we expect service revenue as a percentage of total revenue to decline with the increase in product revenue 

gross margins as a percentage of revenues were 55 49 and 50 in fiscal year 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively approximately 4 of the increase in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 is attributable to streamlining of product manufacturing operations and cost management programs while approximately 2 of the improvement is attributable to improvements in installation customer service and support programs the decrease in fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to reduced capacity utilization resulting from lower business volume and an increased percentage of revenue in the lower margin service business as the conditions in the semiconductor industry continue to strengthen we expect gross margins to continue to improve with the further increase in sales volume introduction of new models streamlining manufacturing costs through the use of common platforms leveraging manufacturing procurement through consolidation of vendors and further expanding on outsourcing initiatives 

engineering research and development 

net engineering research and development expenses were 281 million 268 million and 287 million or 19 20 and 18 of revenues in fiscal year 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the gross dollars for research and development investment increased by 6 million for the fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 the external funding received for fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 decreased by 7 million the increase in gross research and development expenses was driven by an increase in project material and labor costs as we focus on the development of new products and enhancements to existing products in response to the recovery in the semiconductor industry we expect our net engineering research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products and consolidation of the results of operations of a development stage semiconductor company as required by generally accepted accounting principles the absolute dollars decreased in fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal year 2002 due to engineering programs reaching certain milestones that resulted in reductions in labor and material expense additional external funding and cost saving measures such as company mandated timeoff and reduction in discretionary spending implemented during fiscal year 2003 in response to the industry slow down 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development efforts we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the further shrinking of device feature sizes the transition to copper and other new materials and the transition to new 300millimeter fabs our investments in new technology and existing product enhancements are intended to enable our customers to achieve a higher return on their capital investments and higher productivity through costeffective leading edge technology solutions 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses were 249 million 254 million and 291 million or 17 19 and 18 of revenues in fiscal year 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the absolute dollars for selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to company mandated timeoff reductions in labor and discretionary spending as well as other cost saving measures implemented over fiscal years 2003 and 2002 in response to the industry slowdown and the ongoing global economic weakness we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to increase as we build up our organization to meet increased customer demands 

nonrecurring restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges 

in fiscal year 2004 there were no restructuring actions in fiscal year 2003 we restructured certain of our operations to realign costs with planned business levels in light of the industry downturn restructuring costs were classified into two main categories facilities and other charges of 46 million and severance and benefits of 11 million as part of the facilities consolidation we exited several of our leased buildings and included the remaining net book value of the related leasehold improvements as well as the future lease payments net of anticipated sublease revenue in the charge severance and benefit charges were related to the involuntary termination of approximately 70 employees from manufacturing engineering sales marketing and administration in the united states japan and europe the restructuring actions taken in fiscal year 2003 are proceeding as planned with the termination of employees having been completed and the facilities related lease payments we expect to complete by early fiscal year 2006 the annual estimated cost savings from these restructuring actions was 9 million of which 7 million related to workforce reductions and 2 million related to consolidation of facilities and was not expected to have a material effect on our cost of goods sold or operating expenses there were no material variances between the actual and anticipated costs of restructuring the following table shows a summary of restructuring activity related to the fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan for the fiscal year ended june 30 2004 

 in addition to the restructuring action we also recorded severance charges totaling 109 million in operating expenses throughout fiscal year 2003 relating to a series of involuntary employee terminations we believe that both these actions will result in annual reductions in costs of goods sold and operating expenses of approximately 60 million 

in fiscal year 2002 there were no restructuring charges we recorded severance charges of 85 million in operating expenses relating to a series of involuntary employee terminations throughout fiscal year 2002 this resulted in annual cost reductions in costs of goods sold and operating expenses of approximately 44 million 

the semiconductor equipment industry that we operate in is a highly cyclical industry this cyclical nature affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and thus future expense levels if we were to enter into a down cycle we may need to take appropriate actions to scale down operating expenses to lower business levels 

interest income and other net 

interest income and other net was 27 million 42 million and 43 million in fiscal year 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively interest income and other net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on the investment and cash portfolio gains realized on sales of marketable securities and income recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts the decrease in interest income and other net for fiscal year 2004 as compared to fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to a decrease in gains realized on sales of marketable securities and decreased interest income resulting from declining interest rates partially offset by an increase in gains on settlement of foreign currency contracts the decrease in fiscal year 2003 as compared to fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to decreased interest income resulting from declining interest rates and an increase in foreign currency losses resulting from increased volatility in foreign exchange markets partially offset by an increase in realized gains on investments resulting from investment decisions which impacted the timing of realizing gains and losses for these investments 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 25 24 and 25 in fiscal year 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively in general our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35 largely as a function of benefits realized from our extraterritorial income “eti” exclusion research and development tax credits and interest income derived from tax exempt interest 

the effective tax rate of 25 for fiscal year 2004 was higher than the effective tax rate of 24 realized in fiscal year 2003 as a result of more foreign tax expense and state tax and less tax exempt interest and research and development tax credits partially offsetting these adverse changes was an increase in profits in low tax jurisdictions the fiscal year 2004 effective tax rate of 25 includes a one time nonrecurring benefit of 15 million related to the resolution of a prior year federal tax audit matter and a nonrecurring writeoff of a deferred tax asset of 12 million related to an investment the overall reduction in our effective income tax rate from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2003 of 1 was primarily the result of more research and development expenses credit more taxexempt interest and less nondeductible losses relative to these same items as a percentage of pretax income in the prior fiscal year these reductions were partially offset by more relatively foreign tax expense 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income non taxdeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions amounts of taxexempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies there currently is pending legislation to repeal the existing export incentive provided by the united states internal revenue code if enacted this legislation would likely increase our effective rate in future periods in addition the research and development credit contained in the united states internal revenue code has expired under a sunset provision while we expect federal legislation to be passed which would reinstate the research and development credit retroactive to july 1 2004 we have not provided a benefit for the credit in our projected effective rate for fiscal year 2005 if the research and development credit is ultimately reinstated our effective tax rate will be reduced 

liquidity and capital resources 

working capital was 13 billion as of june 30 2004 compared to 12 billion as of june 30 2003 cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities at june 30 2004 increased to 11 billion from 957 million at june 30 2003 in addition we maintained 743 million and 531 million in marketable securities classified as longterm as of june 30 2004 and 2003 respectively 

we have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations cash provided by operating activities was 350 million 246 million and 270 million in fiscal year 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to increases in net income deferred profit and accounts payable partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory balances net income and deferred profit increased in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 primarily due to increased shipments revenues and gross margins partially offset by increased engineering selling general and administrative expenses due to the ramp up in customer demand accounts receivable increased primarily due to higher shipments partially offset by strong collection efforts the increase in accounts payable and inventory was driven primarily due to a ramp up of production in response to increase in customer demand for our products the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to a decline in net income increase in gains from sale of investments and other longterm assets partially offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory balances net income decreased in fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal year 2002 primarily due to declining shipments revenues and gross margins partially offset by decreased engineering selling general and administrative expenses associated with cost saving measures in response to the industry slowdown gains from the sale of investments increased due to investment decision regarding the timing of realizing gains and losses on these investments accounts receivable declined primarily due to strong collection efforts as well as lower shipments the reduction in inventory primarily occurred in production inventory where stringent processes have been put in place for managing material procurement 

we have agreements with three banking institutions to sell without recourse certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from japanese customers during fiscal year 2004 and 2003 we sold 116 million and 99 million respectively of trade receivables and promissory notes from japanese customers under these arrangements at june 30 2004 and 2003 51 million and 27 million respectively of these receivables and notes were outstanding which have not been included in our consolidated balance sheet the total amount available under the facilities is the japanese yen equivalent of 138 million based upon exchange rates as of june 30 2004   we do not believe we are materially at risk for any losses as a result of these agreements in addition from time to time we will discount without recourse letters of credit “lcs” received from customers in payment of goods during the fiscal year 2004 several lcs were sold with proceeds totaling 42 million discounting fees of 02 million for fiscal year 2004 were equivalent to interest expense and were recorded in interest and other income net 

cash used in investing activities was 274 million 99 million and 362 million in fiscal year 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities purchases of capital assets to support longterm growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new market segments or emerging technologies additions of capital assets during fiscal year 2003 consisted mainly of the purchase of certain of our leased buildings in november 2002 compared to fiscal year 2002 additions that consisted mainly of the planned completion of our livermore california facilities 

we generated 113 million and 27 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal year 2004 and 2003 respectively compared with 9 million of cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2002 financing activities typically include sales and repurchases of our common stock as well as borrowings and repayments of debt issuance of common stock provided 169 million 92 million and 115 million in fiscal year 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively we used 56 million 66 million and 123 million in fiscal year 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively to repurchase shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program initiated in 1997 

we have adopted a plan for the systematic repurchase of shares of our common stock in the open market to reduce the dilution created by our stockbased employee benefit and incentive plans since the inception of the repurchase program in 1997 through june 30 2004 our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase a total of 178 million shares including 5 million shares authorized in october 2002 in fiscal year 2004 we repurchased 1175000 shares of our common stock at an average price of 4749 per share for a total of 56 million in fiscal year 2003 we repurchased 1972000 shares of our common stock at an average price of 3342 per share for a total of 66 million in fiscal year 2002 we repurchased 3341000 shares of our common stock at an average price of 3689 per share for a total of 123 million since the inception of the repurchase program in 1997 through june 30 2004 we have repurchased a total of 14496000 shares at an average price of 3390 per share with an additional 33 million shares available for repurchase under the plan all repurchased shares remain as treasury shares 

certain of our leased facilities qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under statement of financial accounting standard 13 “accounting for leases” and as such the facilities were not included on our consolidated balance sheet the lease agreement for certain milpitas and san jose california facilities had a term of five years ending in november 2002 with an option to extend up to two more years under the terms of the lease we at our option could acquire the properties at their original cost or arrange for the properties to be acquired in november 2002 we purchased these facilities at the end of the lease term the purchase transaction increased land and property by approximately 120 million and decreased cash by the same amount 

at june 30 2004 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 19 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors our management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant operating lease commitments as of june 30 2004 in millions 

 additionally we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to help ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecast timehorizon and penalties under cancellation provisions can vary amongst different suppliers as such it is difficult to report accurately our true open commitments at any particular point in time however we estimate our open inventory purchase commitment as of june 30 2004 to be approximately 131 million 

factors affecting results including risks and uncertainties 

fluctuations in operating results and stock price 

our operating results have varied widely in the past and our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon numerous factors including those listed in this section and throughout this annual report on form 10k in addition future operating results may not follow any past trends we believe the factors that could make our results fluctuate and difficult to predict include 

 operating results also could be affected by sudden changes in customer requirements currency exchange rate fluctuations and other economic conditions affecting customer demand and the cost of operations in one or more of the global markets in which we do business as a result of these or other factors we could fail to achieve our expectations as to future revenue gross profit and income from operations our failure to meet the performance expectations set and published by external sources could result in a sudden and significant drop in the price of our stock particularly on a shortterm basis and could negatively affect the value of any investment in our stock 

semiconductor equipment industry volatility 

the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict this cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and thus future expense levels when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound during a down cycle we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

global economic uncertainty 

our business is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses this enduser demand has been significantly depressed over the last few quarters and there has been very limited visibility as to the timing of turnaround in demand growth and from which sector this growth will come a protracted global economic slowdown will continue to exacerbate this issue and may adversely affect our business and results of operation 

international trade operations and economic conditions 

we serve an increasingly global market a majority of our annual revenue is derived from outside the united states and we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue our international revenue and operations are affected by economic conditions specific to each country and region because of our significant dependence on international revenue a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business could negatively affect our operating results 

managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents challenges associated with among other things cultural diversity and organizational alignment moreover each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period periodic local or international economic downturns trade balance issues political instability or terrorism in regions where we have operations and fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our business and results of operations although we attempt to manage nearterm currency risks through the use of hedging instruments there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate 

competition 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and service that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services which we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets loss of competitive position could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenue gross margins and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business 

technological change and customer requirements 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions for example the semiconductor industry continues to shrink the size of semiconductor devices transition to copper and other new materials and transition to new 300millimeter fabs while we expect these trends will increase our customers’ reliance on our diagnostic products we cannot ensure that they will directly improve our business these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staff of highly qualified employees our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards to develop and introduce new products which successfully address changing customer needs to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

in this environment we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance features and functionality there can be no assurance that revenue from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future development substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products in addition we cannot ensure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

key suppliers 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers our business would be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and costeffective manner 

manufacturing disruption 

most of our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states with a small operation located in israel operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism fire earthquake energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers we cannot ensure that alternate production capacity would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if it were available it could be obtained on favorable terms such disruption could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business we currently are in the initial stages of design and implementation of a new integrated financial and supply chain management system disruptions or delays in making changes to our integrated financial and supply chain management system could adversely impact our operations and our ability to forecast sales demand ship products manage our product inventory and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

intellectual property obsolescence and infringement 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our technology that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information our customary practice is to evaluate such assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms or instigation of litigation or other administrative proceedings could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

key employees 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future our business and operations could be harmed 

acquisitions 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources we also seek to acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with the integration of the operations and personnel technologies and products of the acquired companies the possible writedowns of impaired assets and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could seriously harm our business 

litigation 

from time to time we are involved in litigation of various types including litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights and other claims litigation tends to be expensive and requires significant management time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of operations or business if we lose or have to settle a case on significantly adverse terms 

compliance with internal controls evaluations and attestation requirements 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we will be required beginning in fiscal 2005 to perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and have our auditor publicly attest to such evaluation we have prepared an internal plan of action for compliance which includes a timeline and scheduled activities although as of the date of this filing we have not yet prepared the evaluation compliance with these requirements is expected to be expensive and timeconsuming if we fail to timely complete this evaluation or if our registered independent accounting firm cannot timely attest to our evaluation we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls in addition any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 

terrorism and political instability 

the threat of terrorism targeted at the regions of the world in which we do business including the united states increases the uncertainty in our markets and may delay any recovery in the general economy any delay in the recovery of the economy and the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business increased international political instability as demonstrated by the september 2001 terrorist attacks disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of the terrorist attacks and the continuing instability in the middle east may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations such continuing instability could cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate this same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if this international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

earthquake and other uninsured risks 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain other risks that are uninsurable or are insurable only at significant costs are not mitigated via insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations most of which are conducted in california it could also significantly delay our research and engineering effort on new products most of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we self insure earthquake risks because we believe this is the prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also self insured either based on a similar cost benefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occurs we could suffer major financial loss 

future changes in accounting and taxation standards or practices 

a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

for example any changes requiring that we record compensation expense in the statement of operations for employee stock options using the “fair value” method or changes in existing taxation rules related to stock options could have a significant negative effect on our reported results several agencies and entities are considering and the financial accounting standards board “fasb” has announced proposals to change generally accepted accounting principles in the united states that if implemented would require us to record charges to earnings for employee stock option grants this pending requirement would negatively impact our earnings 

effects of recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2003 statement of financial accounting standard no 132 revised 2003 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” sfas 132 was issued and amends further the annual disclosure requirements and requires new quarterly disclosures for pensions and other postretirement benefits the revised statement addresses disclosures only it does not address liability measurement or expense recognition which is determined in accordance with sfas 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas 87 we have provided the amended annual disclosures pursuant to sfas 132 in note 7 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

in march 2004 the fasb issued a proposed statement “sharebased payment an amendment of fasb statements nos 123 and 95” that addresses the accounting for sharebased payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments the proposed statement would eliminate the ability to account for sharebased compensation transactions using the intrinsic method that we currently use and generally would require that such transactions be accounted for using a “fairvalue”based method and recognized as expense in our consolidated statement of operations the recommended effective date of the proposed statement is currently for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2004 should this proposed statement be finalized in its current form it will have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations as we will be required to expense the “fair value” of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan in addition the proposed standard may have a significant impact on our consolidated cash flows from operations no impact to our total consolidated cash flows as under this proposed standard we will be required to reclassify a portion of our tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options from cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from financing activities 

in march 2004 the emerging issues task force “eitf” reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under eitf issue no 0301 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” “eitf 0301” the consensus clarifies the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to investments in debt and equity securities in particular investments within the scope of fasb statement no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” and investments accounted for under the cost method this consensus is to be applied to otherthantemporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning after june 15 2004 we do not believe that this consensus will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at june 30 2004 actual results may differ materially 

at the end of fiscal year 2004 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 107 billion excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents detail of these securities is included in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 from levels as of june 30 2004 the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by 3 million 

as of june 30 2004 we had net forward contracts to sell 107 million in foreign currency in order to hedge currency exposures detail of these contracts is included in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under “derivative instruments” if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2004 the us dollar equivalent would be 133 million a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 29 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that the hedging of our foreign currency exposure should have no material impact on income or cash flows

 item 1 business the company klatencor corporation “klatencor” is the world’s leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries our comprehensive portfolio of products software analysis services and expertise is designed to help integrated circuit “ic” manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire fabrication processfrom research and development to final massproduction yield analysis 

we offer a broad spectrum of products and services that are used by every major wafer ic and photomask manufacturer in the world these customers turn to us for inline wafer defect monitoring reticle and photomask defect inspection critical dimension “cd” metrology wafer overlay film and surface measurement and overall yield and fabwide data analysis these advanced products coupled with our unique yield technology services allow us to deliver the complete yield management solutions our customers need to accelerate their yield learning rates reduce their yield excursion risks and adopt industryleading yield management practices 

klatencor was formed in april 1997 through the merger of kla instruments and tencor instruments two longtime leaders in the semiconductor equipment industry each with over 20 years of experience kla instruments corporation was incorporated in delaware in 1975 tencor instruments was incorporated in california in 1976 effective april 30 1997 tencor instruments merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of kla instruments corporation immediately following this merger kla instruments changed its name to klatencor 

additional information about klatencor is available on our web site at wwwklatencorcom  klatencor makes available free of charge on its web site its annual report on form 10k its quarterly reports on form 10q its current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with or furnish them to the securities and exchange commission “sec” information contained on our web site is not part of this annual report on form 10k or our other filings with the sec 

industry general background 

the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafera round disk that is six eight or twelve inches in diameter about as thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then sliced into wafers and polished to a mirror finish on one surface upon which the circuits are made 

page 4 

the fabrication of an ic or “chip” is accomplished by depositing upon a silicon wafer a series of film layers that act as conductors semiconductors or insulators the deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require over 300 individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip and the upper structure typically consisting of “interconnect” circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure 

current trends 

companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes as well as bringing them into production are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market during past industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with one key new technology or market trend such as a specific design rule shrink in today’s market the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in bringing a multitude of new technologies into production at the same time including copper interconnects new materials sub010micron design rules and 300mm wafers the next larger wafer size from which more than twice as many ics can be produced as from 200mm wafers 

while many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages significant challenges and risks associated with each one have slowed their adoption into fullvolume production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects while device performance characteristics namely speed or capacity become more sensitive to such parameters as line width and film thickness variation copper introduces new physical defects which are harder to find within the interconnect structure as well as electrical defects which cannot be detected using conventional optical inspection systems new process materials like lowk dielectrics silicononinsulator “soi” and 193nm photoresists require extensive characterization before they can be made manufacturable larger 300mm wafers are more susceptible to damage than 200mm wafers since they can bend or bow twice as much creating stress on the wafer that can result in yield loss film uniformity is also more difficult to maintain on these larger wafers moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face since technical challenges in bringing any one of these into production could also slow the adoption of the other technologies 

our key activities during fiscal year 2003 involved the development of new process control and yield management tools that enable chipmakers to accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into fullvolume production while minimizing their associated risks with our portfolio of applicationfocused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise we are in a position to be the single source for comprehensive yield management solutions that enable our customers to achieve firsttomarket success for their nextgeneration products 

the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller linewidth geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased the cost and performance requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over 3 billion a substantial increase over the cost of previousgeneration facilities as a result chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment because our process control and yield management equipment typically represents only a small but growing percentage of the total investment required to build a fabrication facility our customers are better able to leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment “roi”

our process control and yield acceleration solutions 

accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing the production yields of highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing achieving higher yields faster along with higher performance characteristics increases the revenue a manufacturer can obtain from each semiconductor wafer our systems are used to analyze product and process quality at all critical points in the wafer photomask and ic manufacturing process and provide feedback to our customers so that fabrication problems can be identified addressed and eliminated this ability to locate the source of defects and other process issues as well as contain them enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes as well as increase their yields and device value—thus maximizing their roi and lowering their manufacturing costs 

the following are some of the methods used to accelerate yields and optimize device performance all of which require the capture and analysis of data gathered through many measurements 

    engineering analysis  this method of analysis is performed offline from the manufacturing process to identify analyze and locate the source of defects or other manufacturing process issues engineering analysis equipment operates with very high sensitivity to enable comprehensive analysis of wafers because this method operates off the manufacturing line high operational speeds are not required tableend   the most significant opportunities for yield and device performance improvement generally occur when production is started at new factories and technology shifts in existing factories equipment that helps a manufacturer quickly increase new product yields and optimize device performance enables the manufacturer to offer these new products in high volumes early in the product lifecycle—the time when they are likely to generate the greatest profits 

page 6 

we are a leader in the design manufacture marketing and service of process monitoring and yield management systems for the semiconductor wafer ic and photomask industries our technical expertise and understanding of customer needs enable us to provide unique yield management solutions and one of the broadest lines of process monitoring and yield optimization systems available our systems are used to analyze product and process quality at critical points during semiconductor manufacturing as well as provide feedback to our customers that can be used to identify address contain and eliminate fabrication problems 

products we market and sell products to virtually all major semiconductor wafer photomask and data storage manufacturers worldwide we combine our hardware—consisting of patterned and unpatterned wafer inspection optical overlay metrology ebeam review reticle and photomask inspection spectroscopic and ebeambased cd metrology and film and surface measurement tools—with our advanced yield analysis and defect classification software to provide fabwide yield management solutions that are optimized for the manufacturing process cells used in ic production including lithography etch deposition and chemical mechanical planarization “cmp” our offerings can be broadly categorized into five groups defect inspection metrology yield management software solutions data storage and customer service and support 

defect inspection 

our defect inspection tools are used to detect count classify and characterize particles pattern defects and electrical failures both inline at various manufacturing process stages and offline engineering analysis we pioneered the market for automated defect inspection of semiconductor wafers and reticles more than two decades ago our portfolio includes all the tools necessary for our customers to detect correlate and analyze physical and electrical defects as well as determine and correct their cause

  data storage industry 

outside the semiconductor industry we manufacture sell and service yield management solutions to the data storage market in the frontend of thin film head wafer manufacturing we are the leading provider of the same process control equipment with which we serve the semiconductor industry with particular strength in photolithography control in the backend of head manufacturing we are the leading provider of a range of test equipment including flyheight and head resonance testers cdsems and high resolution surface profilers additionally we are leveraging our expertise in magnetics to meet customers’ needs in the emerging mram magnetic random access memory market 

customer service and support 

we enhance the value of our products through our customer service and support programs which provide comprehensive worldwide service and support across all our product lines we also offer yield technology services to improve our customers’ roi 

  global support services 

  page 17 

     yield technology services 

 customers to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant presence throughout the united states europe asiapacific and japan staffed with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers leading semiconductor manufacturers from each of these regions in fiscal 2003 one customer intel corporation accounted for 11 of total revenues in fiscal 2002 and 2001 no single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our revenues 

our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

page 18 

sales service and marketing our sales service and marketing efforts are focused on building longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility found when dealing with a single supplier our revenues are derived primarily from product sales principally through our direct sales force and to a lesser extent through distributors 

we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in the us europe asiapacific and japan we maintain an export compliance program that is designed to fully meet the requirements of the us departments of commerce and state 

as of june 30 2003 we employed over 2300 sales and related personnel service engineers and applications engineers in addition to sales and service offices in the us we conduct sales marketing and services out of whollyowned subsidiaries or branches of us subsidiaries in a variety of countries including china france germany israel italy japan south korea malaysia singapore taiwan thailand and the united kingdom international revenues accounted for approximately 69 67 and 66 of our revenues in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years is incorporated by reference from note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

we believe that sales outside the us will continue to be a significant percentage of our revenues our future performance will depend in part on our ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets for the sale of yield management services in process monitoring equipment our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region especially taiwan china japan and south korea and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region 

international sales and operations may be adversely affected by imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country the revenues from our international business may also be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates although we attempt to manage the currency risk inherent in nondollar sales through “hedging” there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results 

page 19 

backlog our backlog for system shipments and associated warranty totaled 509 million at june 30 2003 we include in our backlog only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within twelve months we exclude from backlog orders for nonreleased products we expect to fill the present backlog of orders during fiscal 2004 however all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and to cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 

research and development the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing we believe continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs as part of our customer relationships we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby our customers offset certain of our research and development costs 

our key research and development activities during fiscal year 2003 involved development of process control and yield management equipment especially reticle inspection and advanced wafer inspection for smaller feature sizes copperbased devices and 300mm wafers for information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k 

in order to make continuing developments in the semiconductor industry we are committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development new product introductions may contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer ordering existing products if new products have reliability or quality problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional service and warranty expenses on occasion we have experienced reliability and quality problems in connection with certain product introductions resulting in some of these consequences there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new hardware and software products or that new hardware and software products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be affected adversely 

manufacturing raw materials and supplies we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our principal manufacturing activities take place in san jose and milpitas california with additional operations in san diego and hayward california and migdal ha’emek israel as of june 30 2003 we employed approximately 960 manufacturing and 1000 engineering personnel 

page 20 

many of the parts components and subassemblies collectively “parts” are standard commercial products although certain items are made to our specifications we use numerous vendors to supply parts for the manufacture and support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible and certain parts included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts by monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers and by ensuring adequate inventories of key parts are available to maintain manufacturing schedules 

although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from established and potential competitors some of which may have greater financial research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than us such as applied materials inc and hitachi electronics engineering co ltd we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and development 

significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability installed base and technical service and support we believe that while price and delivery are important competitive factors the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes thereby enhancing productivity 

our process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor industry are intended to compete based upon performance and technical capabilities these systems may compete with less expensive and more laborintensive manual inspection devices 

management believes that we are well positioned with respect to both our products and services however any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

acquisitions we continue to pursue a course of strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities in fiscal 2002 we acquired substantially all of the assets of qc optics inc “qc optics” a manufacturer of laserbased inspection systems for semiconductor flat panel and computer hard disk manufacturing industries 

page 21 

the financial position and results of operations of this acquisition were immaterial in relation to those of klatencor and this transaction was accounted for as a purchase further details of our acquisitions during the last three fiscal years are included in note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies possible writedowns of impaired assets and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

patents and other proprietary rights we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secrets we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and intend to continue to pursue the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license rights under us and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 

due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry we believe that our protection of patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers 

no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted hereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology 

employees as of june 30 2003 we employed a total of approximately 4900 persons none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good 

competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management marketing and technical employees

we also lease office space for other smaller sales and service offices in several locations throughout the world our operating leases expire at various times through june 30 2012 with renewal options at the fair market value for additional periods up to five years additional information of these leases is incorporated by reference from note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k we believe our properties are adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and that our production facilities have capacity adequate for our current needs 




 item 3 legal proceedings we are named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict we believe that we have defenses in each of the cases set forth below and are vigorously contesting each of these matters 

ade corporation 

on october 11 2000 ade corporation “ade” a competitor filed a patent infringement lawsuit against us in the us district court in delaware ade claimed damages and sought an injunction under us patent no 6118525 “525 patent” we filed a counterclaim in the same court alleging that ade has infringed four of our patents we are seeking damages and a permanent injunction against ade in addition we are seeking a declaration from the district court that ade’s patent is invalid and not infringed by us on october 22 2001 we filed a separate action for declaratory judgment against ade in the northern district of california requesting a declaration that us patent no 6292259 “259 patent” is invalid and not infringed that action has now been consolidated with the prior action in the delaware proceeding and ade has amended its complaint in that proceeding to allege that we are infringing the ‘259 patent on august 8 2002 the magistrate presiding over the action issued a recommendation that the court enter summary judgment in our favor on the issue of noninfringement under ade’s ‘525 patent on the same day the magistrate issued recommendations that the court enter summary judgment in favor of ade on the issue of noninfringement of two of our patents the district court judge subsequently substantially adopted the recommendations of the magistrate regarding claims construction 

tokyo seimitsu co ltd 

on june 27 2001 we sued tokyo seimitsu co ltd and tsk america inc tsk a competitor in the us district court in the northern district of california alleging that tsk infringes on one of the companys patents the suit seeks damages and an injunction under us patent no 4805123 123 patent tsk filed a counterclaim in the same court seeking a declaration that the 123 patent is invalid unenforceable and not infringed and also alleged violations of the antitrust and unfair competition laws the district court judge has entered a ruling that calls into question the validity of the patent in suit we are examining remedies in connection with that determination 

although we cannot predict the outcome of these claims we do not believe that any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position were an unfavorable ruling to occur in one or more of the pending claims there exists a possibility of a material impact on our operating results for the period in which the ruling occurred

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements which involve risk and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those discussed in “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions actual results could differ from those estimates we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis and the audit committee has reviewed the company’s disclosure relating to them in this annual report on form 10k the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows 

  revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the sale price is fixed or determinable delivery has occurred or services rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured we changed our interpretation of “delivery” based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 effective july 1 2000 prior to adoption of sab 101 we generally recognized system revenue when title transferred to the customer mostly upon shipment system revenue includes hardware and software that is incidental to the product we now generally recognize system revenue upon positive affirmation by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications this positive affirmation is generally evidenced by an acceptance document signed by the customer this change has the impact of prolonging the cycle time between order placement and revenue recognition in limited cases we allow for exceptions where we recognize system revenue upon shipment if acceptance is not required however these exceptions have accounted for approximately 31 and 25 of our revenue for the fiscal years ended 2003 and 2002 shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements under “revenue recognition” for detailed description of exceptions 

page 28 

revenue from software license fees is typically recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable the fee is fixed or determinable and vendorspecific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of services andor upgrades if vendorspecific objective evidence does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement all revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist or until all elements are delivered whichever is earlier in instances where an arrangement to deliver software requires significant modification or customization license fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting allowances are established for potential product returns and credit losses to date revenue from license fees have been less than 10 of total revenue 

spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 

service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract if maintenance is included in an arrangement which includes a software license agreement amounts related to maintenance are allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed 

the deferred system profit balance as of june 30 2003 was 177 million this amount equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment and deferred under sab 101 less applicable product and warranty costs the deferred profit balance decreased from 194 million at june 30 2002 primarily because shipments were lower than customer acceptance for which revenue was recognized during fiscal 2003 

we also defer the fair value of nonstandard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue nonstandard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months nonstandard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences the unearned revenue balance decreased to 48 million at june 30 2003 from 55 million at june 30 2002 primarily due to the increase in service revenue recognized from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 

  inventory reserves we review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis for production inventory our methodology involves matching our onhand and onorder inventory with our build forecast over the next twelve months we then evaluate the parts found to be in excess of the twelvemonth demand and take appropriate reserves to reflect the risk of obsolescence for spare parts inventory we match our onhand inventory against twentyfour months of usage we then evaluate the parts in excess of the twentyfour month usage and take appropriate reserves to reflect risk of obsolescence both methodologies are significantly affected by the usage assumption the longer the time period of estimated usage the lower the reserves are required based on our past experience we believe the twelvemonthtwentyfour month time periods best reflect the reasonable and relative obsolescence risks if actual demand or usage were to be substantially lower than estimated additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold 

page 29 

  allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed periodically to assess the adequacy of the allowance we take into consideration 1 any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change and the financial condition of our customers were adversely affected resulting in their inability to meet their financial obligations to us we may need to take additional allowances which would result in a reduction of our net income 

  warranty we provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for twelve months providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to cost of sales when revenue is recognized the estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses utilizing actual service records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge we update these estimated charges every quarter the actual product performance andor field expense profiles may differ and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly the difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions for which there is limited or no historical product performance on which to base the estimated warranty expense more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates nonstandard warranty generally includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage for twelve months nonstandard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences 

  contingencies and litigation we are currently named as a party to various legal proceedings including those outlined in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” in this annual report on form 10k while we currently believe the ultimate outcome of these proceedings both individually and in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position but may adversely affect our quarterly operating results the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict we would accrue the cost of an adverse judgment if in our estimation the adverse settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the ultimate cost to us we have made no such accruals as of june 30 2003 

  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities sfas no 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable 

page 30 

on a quarterly basis we provide for income taxes based upon an annual effective income tax rate the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings tax regulations governing each region availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis if actual results differ from these estimates this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

results of operations during fiscal 2003 we continued to face a significant downturn in the semiconductor industry which started in early calendar year 2001 in calendar year 2001 the demand for semiconductors dropped by approximately 32 and remained flat to slightly higher in calendar year 2002 although new orders grew quarter on quarter by approximately 21 million in the three months ended june 30 2003 we are still cautious about the timing of a broad based turnaround in the growth of demand for semiconductors looking forward electronics industry analysts forecast semiconductor shipments for calendar year 2003 to grow over calendar year 2002 

over the longer term we expect process control to continue to represent a higher percentage of our customers’ capital spending we believe this increase in process control spending will be driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes the transition to copper and other new materials and the transition to new 300millimeter fabs we anticipate these factors will drive increased demand for our products and services when the semiconductor industry recovers 

new system and service orders by region were as follows in millions 

 page 31 

klatencor’s backlog for unshipped system orders as of june 30 2003 was approximately 509 million a majority of which we expect to ship over the next six to nine months in addition we have 351 million of sab 101 deferred revenue that is related to products that have been delivered but are awaiting written acceptance from the customer 

revenues and gross margin product revenue in fiscal 2003 decreased 368 million or 26 to 106 billion from 143 billion in fiscal 2002 product revenue decreased 479 million or 25 to 143 billion in fiscal 2002 from 191 billion in fiscal 2001 product revenue declines were primarily from reduced capital spending by our customers as a result of a significant reduction in the demand for semiconductors over the last two years in fiscal 2003 international product revenue increased slightly to 71 of revenue from 69 in fiscal 2002 due to higher demand in taiwan in fiscal 2002 international product revenue increased slightly to 69 of revenue from 67 in the prior year due to higher demand in japan and western europe partially offset by lower demand in taiwan 

service revenue is generated from maintenance service contracts as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period service revenues were 263 million 209 million and 196 million in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively service revenue continued to increase throughout the 3yearperiod as our installed base of equipment at our customers’ sites continued to grow the amount of service revenue generated is generally a function of the number of postwarranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the degree of utilization of those systems 

gross margins as a percentage of revenues were 49 50 and 55 in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the decrease in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 were primarily due to reduced capacity utilization resulting from lower business volume and an increased percentage of revenue in the lower margin service business although gross margins fell below the 50 level in fiscal 2003 we have implemented plans for continued expense reductions aimed at bringing margins back above the 50 range even if industry conditions remain weak our plans for expense reduction include streamlining manufacturing costs through the use of common platforms leveraging manufacturing procurement through consolidation of vendors and further expanding on outsourcing initiatives 

engineering research and development net engineering research and development expenses were 268 million 287 million and 356 million or 20 18 and 17 of revenues in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the absolute dollars decreased in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 due to engineering programs reaching certain milestones that resulted in reductions in labor and material expense additional external funding and cost saving measures such as company mandated timeoff and reduction in discretionary spending implemented over the last several quarters in response to the industry slow down the dollars decreased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 primarily due to temporary shutdowns management pay cuts reductions in temporary labor and discretionary spending as well as other cost saving measures implemented over the last year we expect our net engineering research and development expenses to be flat to slightly up in absolute dollars as we make investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and existing product enhancements 

page 32 

net engineering research and development expenses were partially offset by 18 million 14 million and 8 million in external funding received under certain strategic development programs conducted with several of our customers and government grants in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 

our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development efforts we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the further shrinking of device feature sizes the transition to copper and other new materials and the transition to new 300millimeter fabs our investments in new technology and existing product enhancements are intended to enable our customers to achieve a higher return on their capital investments and higher productivity through costeffective leading edge technology solutions 

selling general and administrative selling general and administrative expenses were 254 million 291 million and 354 million or 19 18 and 17 of revenues in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the absolute dollars for selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to company mandated timeoff reductions in labor and discretionary spending as well as other cost saving measures implemented over the last several quarters in response to the industry slowdown and the ongoing global economic weakness we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to be flat to slightly down in absolute dollars as we continue to realize the benefits from these cost saving measures 

nonrecurring acquisition restructuring and other charges the following is a summary of nonrecurring acquisition restructuring and other charges for the three fiscal years ending june 30 

 page 33 

restructuring and other charges 

in fiscal 2003 we structured certain of our operations to realign costs with planned business levels in light of the industry downturn we classified restructuring costs into two main categories facilities and other charges of 46 million and severance and benefits of 11 million as part of the facilities consolidation we exited several of our leased buildings and have included the remaining net book value of the related leasehold improvements as well as the future lease payments net of anticipated sublease revenue in the charge severance and benefit charges were related to the involuntary termination of approximately 70 personnel from manufacturing engineering sales marketing and administration in the united states japan and europe the restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2003 are proceeding as planned with the termination of employees having been completed and the facilities related lease payments scheduled to be completed by the end of fiscal 2004 in addition during the first fiscal quarter of 2003 we received 152 million as a second and final installment on the sale of software and intellectual property associated with our isupport ™ online customer support technology which was netted against the above nonrecurring charges resulting in a reported net gain of 94 million 

in addition to the restructuring action we also recorded severance charges totaling 109 million in operating expenses throughout fiscal 2003 relating to a series of employee involuntary terminations we believe that both these actions will result in annual reductions in costs of goods sold and operating expenses of approximately 60 million 

in fiscal 2002 there were no restructuring charges we recorded severance charges of 85 million in operating expenses relating to a series of employee involuntary terminations throughout fiscal 2002 this resulted in annual cost reductions in costs of goods sold and operating expenses of approximately 44 million in fiscal 2001 in response to the downturn in the semiconductor industry we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce spending charges related to the restructuring plan included facilities of 47 million severance and benefits of 16 million and other costs of 10 million facilities related charges were associated with two of our leased office buildings that were vacated and included the remaining net book value of the related leasehold improvements as well as the future lease payments net of anticipated sublease revenue in the charge during fiscal 2001 we reduced our workforce by approximately 5 primarily in the manufacturing areas and recorded severance charges related to these terminations the restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2001 were substantially completed at the end of fiscal 2002 these restructuring actions resulted in annual reductions in cost of goods sold and operation expenses of approximately 18 million in addition during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001 we sold software and intellectual property associated with its isupport ™ online customer support technology and recorded 100 million pretax nonrecurring income which was netted with the other nonrecurring charges 

the following table shows the details of the facilities severance and other restructuring costs accrual for the fiscal year ended june 30 2003 

 page 34 

the semiconductor equipment industry that we operate in is a highly cyclical industry this cyclical nature affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and thus future expense levels we are currently in a down cycle and if this current down cycle continues to linger or worsens we may need to take appropriate actions to scale down operating expenses to even lower business levels 

acquisitions 

during fiscal years 2002 and 2001 we completed certain purchase acquisitions the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material on either an individual or aggregate basis for a period of up to twelve months from the acquisition date we may change the original purchase price allocation for preacquisition uncertainties after twelve months we record the fair value of such reasonably estimable contingencies 

the amounts allocated to inprocess research and development “inprocess rd” were determined through established valuation techniques in the hightechnology equipment industry and were expensed upon acquisition because technology feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed amounts allocated to goodwill and purchased intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over periods not exceeding five years 

a summary of purchase transactions is outlined as follows in thousands 

 1 with the acquisition of qc optics we received certain intellectual property in laserbased inspection systems for the semiconductor flat panel and computer hard disk manufacturing industries 2 klatencor acquired certain assets and technology of phase metrics the leading supplier of inspectioncertification products in the data storage industry 

the difference between the purchase price and the goodwill intangibles and inprocess rd represents amount allocated to the net tangible assets acquired there was no deferred stockbased compensation for any of the acquisitions 

page 35 

interest income and other net interest income and other net was 42 million 43 million and 54 million in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively interest income and other net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on the investment and cash portfolio gains realized on sales of marketable securities and income recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts the decrease in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to decreased interest income resulting from declining interest rates and an increase in foreign currency losses resulting from increased volatility in foreign exchange markets partially offset by an increase in realized gains on investments resulting from investment decisions which impacted the timing of realizing gains and losses for these investments the decrease in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to decreased interest income resulting from declining interest rates 

provision for income taxes klatencor’s effective income tax rate was 24 25 and 27 in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively in general our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35 largely as a function of benefits realized from our extraterritorial income “eti” exclusion research and development tax credits and income derived from tax exempt interest 

the overall reduction in our effective income tax rate from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 of 1 is primarily the result of more rd credit more taxexempt interest and less nondeductible losses relative to these same items as a percentage of pretax income in the prior fiscal year these reductions were partially offset by more relative foreign tax expense the overall reduction in our effective income tax rate from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 of 2 was the result of a combination of factors most important of which were more export sales benefits more taxexempt interest income and less state tax expense relative to these same items as a percentage of pretax income in fiscal 2001 these reductions were partially offset by more relative foreign tax expense 

our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions amounts of taxexempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pretax income and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies there currently is pending legislation to repeal the existing export incentive provided by the united states internal revenue code if the legislation were enacted it would likely increase our effective rate in future periods 

page 36 

liquidity and capital resources working capital was 116 billion as of june 30 2003 compared to 932 million as of june 30 2002 cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities at june 30 2003 increased to 957 million from 673 million at june 30 2002 in addition we maintained 531 million and 660 million in marketable securities classified as longterm as of june 30 2003 and 2002 respectively 

klatencor has historically financed its operations through cash generated from operations cash provided by operating activities was 246 million 270 million and 408 million in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to a decline in net income increase in gains from sale of investments and other longterm assets partially offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory balances net income decreased in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to declining shipments revenues and gross margins partially offset by decreased engineering selling general and administrative expenses associated with cost saving measures in response to the industry slowdown gains from the sale of investments increased due to investment decision regarding the timing of realizing gains and losses on these investments accounts receivable declined primarily due to strong collection efforts as well as lower shipments the reduction in inventory primarily occurred in production inventory where stringent processes have been put in place for managing material procurement the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to decreased income before the cumulative effect of accounting change and lower accounts payable partially offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory balances income before cumulative effect of accounting change decreased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 primarily due to declining shipments revenues and gross margins partially offset by decreased engineering selling general and administrative expenses associated with cost saving measures in response to the industry slowdown accounts payable shrank due to decreased expenditures and lower incoming invoices accounts receivable declined primarily due to strong collection efforts as well as lower shipments the reduction in inventory was driven primarily in production inventory where stringent processes have been put in place for managing material procurement 

we have agreements with two japanese institutions to sell without recourse certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes during fiscal 2003 we sold 99 million and during 2002 we sold 98 million of trade notes and accounts receivable from japanese customers under these arrangements at june 30 2003 and 2002 27 million and 48 million respectively of these receivables and notes were outstanding which have not been included in our consolidated balance sheet as the criteria for sale treatment established by sfas 140 have been met under sfas 140 after a transfer of financial assets an entity derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished the total amount available under the facilities is the japanese yen equivalent of 92 million based upon exchange rates as of june 30 2003 we do not believe we are materially at risk for any losses as a result of these agreements 

page 37 

cash used in investing activities was 99 million 362 million and 295 million in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities purchases of capital assets to support longterm growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new market segments or emerging technologies additions of capital assets during fiscal 2003 consisted mainly of the purchase of certain of our leased buildings in november 2002 compared to fiscal 2002 additions that consisted mainly of the planned completion of our livermore facilities 

we generated 27 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2003 compared with 9 million and 58 million of cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively financing activities typically include sales and repurchases of our common stock as well as borrowings and repayments of debt issuance of common stock net of repurchases provided 27 million in fiscal 2003 repurchases of common stock net of issuance used 8 million and 60 million in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 respectively 

we have adopted a plan for the systematic repurchase of shares of our common stock in the open market to reduce the dilution created by our stockbased employee benefit and incentive plans since the inception of the repurchase program in 1997 through june 30 2003 our board of directors has authorized klatencor to repurchase a total of 178 million shares including 5 million shares authorized in october 2002 in fiscal 2003 we repurchased 1972000 shares of our common stock at an average price of 3342 per share for a total of 66 million in fiscal 2002 we repurchased 3341000 shares of our common stock at an average price of 3689 per share for a total of 123 million in fiscal 2001 we repurchased 4580000 shares of our common stock at an average price of 3354 per share for a total of 154 million since the inception of the repurchase program in 1997 through june 30 2003 we have repurchased a total of 13321000 shares at an average price of 3270 per share with an additional 45 million shares available for repurchase under the plan all repurchased shares remain as treasury shares 

certain of our leased facilities qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under sfas 13 “accounting for leases” and as such the facilities are not included on our consolidated balance sheet the lease agreement for certain milpitas and san jose california facilities had a term of five years ending in november 2002 with an option to extend up to two more years under the terms of the lease we at our option could acquire the properties at their original cost or arrange for the properties to be acquired in november 2002 we purchased these facilities at the end of the lease term the purchase transaction increased land and property by approximately 120 million and decreased cash by the same amount 

at june 30 2003 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 149 billion of cash cash equivalents and investments our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors our management believes that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 

page 38 

the following is a schedule summarizing our significant operating lease commitments as of june 30 2003 in millions 

 additionally we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties this forecast timehorizon can vary amongst different suppliers as such it is difficult to accurately report our true open commitments at any particular point in time however we estimate our open inventory purchase commitment as of june 30 2003 to be no more than 42 million 

factors affecting results including risks and uncertainties fluctuations in operating results and stock price 

our operating results have varied widely in the past and our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon numerous factors including those listed in this section and throughout this annual report on form 10k in addition future operating results may not follow any past trends we believe the factors that could make our results fluctuate and difficult to predict include 

o global economic uncertainty o the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry o changing international economic conditions o competitive pressure o our ability to develop and implement new technologies and introduce new products o our ability to manage our manufacturing requirements o our ability to protect our intellectual property o our ability to attract retain and replace key employees o worldwide political instability and o earthquake and other uninsured risks 

operating results also could be affected by sudden changes in customer requirements currency exchange rate fluctuations and other economic conditions affecting customer demand and the cost of operations in one or more of the global markets in which we do business as a result of these or other factors we could fail to achieve our expectations as to future revenue gross profit and income from operations our failure to meet the performance expectations set and published by external sources could result in a sudden and significant drop in the price of our stock particularly on a shortterm basis and could negatively affect the value of any investment in our stock 

page 39 

global economic uncertainty 

our business is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses this enduser demand has been significantly depressed over the last few quarters and there has been very limited visibility as to the timing of turnaround in demand growth and from which sector this growth will come a protracted global economic slowdown will continue to exacerbate this issue and may adversely affect our business and results of operation 

semiconductor equipment industry volatility 

the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict this cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and thus future expense levels when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound during a down cycle we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees in addition during periods of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles if we fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed 

we are currently in an industry down cycle we are not able to predict when the semiconductor industry will recover during a down cycle the semiconductor industry typically experiences excess production capacity that causes semiconductor manufacturers to decrease capital spending we generally do not have longterm volume production contracts with our customers and we do not control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers whether and to what extent our customers place orders for any specific products as well as the mix and quantities of products included in those orders are factors beyond our control insufficient orders especially in our down cycles will result in underutilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure and will negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

international trade and economic conditions 

we serve an increasingly global market a majority of our annual revenue is derived from outside the united states and we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue our international revenue and operations are affected by economic conditions specific to each country and region because of our significant dependence on international revenue a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business could negatively affect our operating results 

page 40 

managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents challenges associated with among other things cultural diversity and organizational alignment moreover each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period periodic local or international economic downturns trade balance issues political instability in regions where we have operations such as israel and fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our business and results of operations although we attempt to manage nearterm currency risks through the use of hedging instruments there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate in addition our ability to address normal business transaction issues in asia is at risk due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in asia which has resulted in management’s decision to limit travel to asia in accordance with the world health organization’s recommendations 

competition 

our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide our future performance depends in part upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which compete with the products and service that we offer these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products in addition we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services which we offer using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets loss of competitive position could negatively affect our prices customer orders revenue gross margin and market share any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business 

technological change and customer requirements 

success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions for example the semiconductor industry continues to shrink the size of semiconductor devices transition to copper and other new materials and transition to new 300millimeter fabs while we expect these trends will increase our customers’ reliance on our diagnostic products we cannot ensure that they will directly improve our business these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards to develop and introduce new products which successfully address changing customer needs to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed 

page 41 

in this environment we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance features and functionality there can be no assurance that revenue from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future development substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product and not all development activities result in commercially viable products in addition we cannot ensure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products 

key suppliers 

we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions andor shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers our business would be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and costeffective manner 

manufacturing disruption 

most of our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states with a small operation located in israel operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages acts of war terrorism fire earthquake energy shortages flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers we cannot ensure that alternate production capacity would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that if it were available it could be obtained on favorable terms such disruption could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business 

page 42 

intellectual property obsolescence and infringement 

our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our technology that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own adversely affecting our business 

we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 

while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through other security measures we also maintain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 

as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies or information our customary practice is to evaluate such assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 

key employees 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel if we are unable to retain key personnel or if we are not able to attract assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future our business and operations could be harmed these factors could seriously harm our business 

page 43 

acquisitions 

in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources we also seek to acquire new technologies from external sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products services andor technologies acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and costs in connection with the integration of the operations and personnel technologies and products of the acquired companies the possible writedowns of impaired assets and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could seriously harm our business 

litigation 

from time to time we are involved in litigation of various types including litigation that alleges infringement of intellectual property rights and other claims litigation tends to be expensive and requires significant management time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of operations or business if we lose or have to settle a case on significantly adverse terms if we lose in a dispute concerning intellectual property a court could require us to pay substantial damages andor royalties or could issue an injunction prohibiting us from using essential technologies for these and other reasons this type of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations also although we may seek to obtain a license under a third party’s intellectual property rights in order to bring an end to certain claims or actions asserted against us we may not be able to obtain such a license on reasonable terms or at all 

terrorism and political instability 

the threat of terrorism targeted at the regions of the world in which we do business including the united states increases the uncertainty in our markets and may delay any recovery in the general economy any delay in the recovery of the economy and the semiconductor industry could seriously impact our business 

increased international political instability as demonstrated by the september 2001 terrorist attacks disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of the terrorist attacks and the continuing instability in the middle east may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations such continuing instability could cause us to incur increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase our insurance costs and cause international currency markets to fluctuate this same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products if this international political instability continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed 

earthquake and other uninsured risks 

we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks however certain other risks that are uninsurable or are insurable only at significant costs are not mitigated via insurance an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations most of which are conducted in california it could also significantly delay our research and engineering effort on new products most of which is also conducted in california we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake we self insure earthquake risks because we believe this is the prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market certain other risks are also self insured either based on a similar cost benefit analysis or based on the unavailability of insurance if one or more of the uninsured events occur we could suffer major financial loss

effects of recent accounting pronouncements we have adopted statement no 143 “sfas 143” “accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets” and statement no 144 “sfas 144” “accounting for the impairment of disposal of longlived assets” sfas 143 establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost it also provides guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets sfas 144 establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets including discontinued operations adoption of these pronouncements did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2002 the fasb issued statement no 146 “sfas 146” “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” sfas 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 943 liabilities recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring this statement requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred sfas 146 will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after march 31 2003 the standard will in certain circumstances change the timing of recognition of restructuring costs 

in november 2002 eitf reached a consensus on issue no 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” this issue addresses determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting eitf issue no 0021 will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 or we may elect to report the change in accounting as a cumulativeeffect adjustment we are reviewing eitf issue no 0021 and have not yet determined the impact this issue will have on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

in december 2002 fasb issued sfas 148 an amendment of sfas 123 this statement amends sfas 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation it also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity’s accounting policy decisions with respect to stockbased employee compensation finally this statement amends apb opinion no 28 interim financial reporting to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information since we are continuing to account for stock based compensation according to apb 25 our adoption of sfas 148 requires us to provide prominent disclosures about the effects of sfas 123 on reported income and requires us to disclose these affects in our interim consolidated financial statements as well sfas 148 was effective for interim fiscal periods beginning after december 15 2002 adoption of this standard had no material impact on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

page 45 

in january 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities” an interpretation of arb no 51 fin 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties fin 46 is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january 31 2003 for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february 1 2003 the provisions of fin 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june 15 2003 we believe that although the adoption of this standard will result in consolidation of certain entities it will have no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2003 the fasb issued statement no 149 “sfas no 149” “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly in particular this statement clarifies the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component amends the definition of an underlying to conform it to the language used in fin 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” and amends certain other existing pronouncements the provisions of sfas no 149 which were not already applied under an implementation issue are effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 we believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations 

in may 2003 the fasb issued statement no 150 “sfas no 150” “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” sfas no 150 establishes standards for classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity it requires financial instruments within its scope to be classified as a liability or an asset in some circumstances many of those financial instruments were previously classified as equity sfas no 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 for financial instruments created before and still existing as of the issuance of this statement a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle shall be reported upon implementation in the first interim period beginning after june 15 2003 we believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at june 30 2003 actual results may differ materially 

at the end of fiscal 2003 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of 858 million excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents detail of these securities is included in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements found under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k these securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 from levels as of june 30 2003 the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by 1 million 

as of june 30 2003 we had net forward contracts to sell 56 million in foreign currency in order to hedge currency exposures detail of these contracts is incorporated by reference from note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under “derivative instruments” if we had entered into these contracts on june 30 2003 the us dollar equivalent would be 55 million a 10 adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by 23 million however if this occurred the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount accordingly we believe that the hedging of our foreign currency exposure should have no material impact on income or cash flows

industry

general background

         the  semiconductor  fabrication  process  begins  with a  bare  silicon
wafera  round disk that is six  eight or twelve inches in diameter  about as
thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is
in itself  highly  sophisticated  involving  the  creation  of large  ingots of
silicon  by  pulling  them out of a vat of molten  silicon  the ingots are then
sliced into wafers and polished to a mirror  finish on one  surface  upon which
the circuits are made

         the   fabrication  of  an  integrated   circuit  ic  or  chip  is
accomplished by depositing a series of film layers upon a silicon wafer that act
as conductors semiconductors or insulators the deposition of these film layers
is interspersed  with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns
remove  portions of the film layers  and perform other  functions  such as heat
treatment  measurement and inspection  most advanced chip designs require over
300 individual  steps  many of which are performed  multiple times  most chips
consist of two main  structures  the lower structure  typically  consisting of
transistors or capacitors which performs the smart functions of the chip and
the upper structure  typically  consisting of interconnect  circuitry  which
connects the components in the lower structure

current trends

         companies  that  anticipate  future market  demands by  developing  and
refining new technologies and manufacturing  processes as well as bringing them
into  production  are better  positioned to lead in the  semiconductor  market
during previous industry cycles  semiconductor  manufacturers  generally had to
contend with one key new technology or market trend  such as a specific  design
page
rule shrink  in todays market  the leading  semiconductor  manufacturers  are
investing in bringing  three key new  technologies  into  production at the same
time copper interconnects  deepsubwavelength lithography 013micron design
rules and below  and 300 mm the next larger wafer size  from which more than
twice as many ics can be produced as on 200 mm wafers

         while  each  of  these  three  technologies  has  been  adopted  at the
development and pilot  production  stages  several  significant  challenges and
risks  associated  with each one have slowed  their  adoption  into  fullvolume
production  for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive
to the size and density of defects  while  device  performance  characteristics
become  more  sensitive  to such  parameters  as  linewidth  and  filmthickness
variation  among other factors  copper introduces both new defects  which are
harder to find within the interconnect structure as well as electrical defects
which cannot be detected using conventional  optical inspection systems  300 mm
wafers are more  susceptible to damage than 200 mm wafers since they can bend or
bow twice as much  creating  stress on the wafer that can result in yield loss
film  uniformity  is also more  difficult  to maintain on these  larger  wafers
moving all three of these  advanced  technologies  into  production at once only
adds to the risk that chipmakers  face  since technical  challenges in bringing
any one of these into production  could also be a factor in slowing the adoption
of the other two

         our key activities  during fiscal year 2002 involved the development of
new  process  control  and yield  management  tools that  enable  chipmakers  to
accelerate the adoption of these new technologies  into fullvolume  production
while   minimizing   their   associated    risks    with   our   portfolio   of
applicationfocused  technologies and our dedicated yield technology  expertise
we are in a unique  position  to be the single  source for  comprehensive  yield
management  solutions  that  enable our  customers  to  achieve  firsttomarket
success for their nextgeneration products

         the continuing evolution of semiconductor  devices to smaller linewidth
geometries and more complex  multilevel  circuitry has significantly  increased
the  cost  and  performance  requirements  of  the  capital  equipment  used  to
manufacture  these  devices  construction  of  an  advanced  wafer  fabrication
facility  can cost over 2  billion  a  substantial  increase  over the cost of
previousgeneration  facilities as a result chipmakers are demanding increased
productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment  because our
process control and yield management equipment typically represents only a small
percentage of the total investment required to build a fabrication facility our
customers are able to better leverage these  increasingly  expensive  facilities
and significantly improve their return on investment roi

our process control and yield acceleration solutions

         accelerating  the yield ramp and maximizing  the  production  yields of
highperformance  devices are key goals of modern  semiconductor  manufacturing
achieving higher yields faster  along with higher performance  characteristics
increases the revenue a manufacturer can obtain from each  semiconductor  wafer
klatencors  systems are used to analyze  product  and  process  quality at all
critical  points in the ic  manufacturing  process and  provide  feedback to our
customers  so  that  fabrication  problems  can  be  identified  addressed  and
eliminated  this  ability to locate the  source of  defects  and other  process
issues as well as contain them enables semiconductor  manufacturers to improve
page
control over their manufacturing processes as well as increase their yields and
device valuethus maximizing the return on their investments and lowering their
manufacturing costs

         the  following  are some of the methods used to  accelerate  yields and
optimize  device  performance  all of which require the capture and analysis of
data gathered through many measurements

                  engineering  analysis  this method of  analysis is  performed
         offline from the manufacturing process to identify analyze and locate
         the  source  of  defects  or  other   manufacturing   process   issues
         engineering  analysis  equipment operates with very high sensitivity to
         enable comprehensive  analysis of wafers  because this method operates
         off the manufacturing line high operational speeds are not required

                  inline monitoring  this method of analysis is used to review
         the status of ics during production  information  generated is used to
         determine  whether the  fabrication  process steps are within  required
         tolerances  it is also used to make any  necessary  realtime  process
         adjustments  before  wafer lots move to  subsequent  process  stations
         because  information  related  to defects  is needed  quickly  inline
         monitoring requires both high throughput and high sensitivity

                  passfail  tests  this  method  of  analysis  may be  used at
         several  different  points in the  manufacturing  process  to  evaluate
         whether products meet performance specifications

         the most  significant  opportunities  for yield and device  performance
improvement generally occur when production is started at new factories and when
chips or wafers are first built  equipment  that helps a  manufacturer  quickly
increase  new  product  yields  and  optimize  device  performance  enables  the
manufacturer  to offer these new products in high  volumes  early in the product
life cyclethe time when they are likely to generate the greatest profits

service of process monitoring and yield management systems for the semiconductor
industry  our technical expertise and understanding of customer needs enable us
to provide  unique yield  management  solutions and one of the broadest lines of
process  monitoring  and yield  management  function  systems  available  in the

         highresolution imaging inspection

                  our 2xxx wafer  inspection  series  first introduced in 1992
         has set the standard for  highsensitivity  patterned wafer  inspection
         through  a  unique  combination  of  highspeed  image  processing  an
         ultrabroadband  brightfield illumination source and our segmented auto
         threshold   technology   in  2000  we  unveiled  our  nextgeneration
         platform  the 2350 which was the first ultraviolet  uv inspection
         system to feature ultrabroadband brightfield illumination  delivering
         a twofold  increase in throughput  over the previous  generation  2xxx
         platform  the 2350  enables the  resolution  of circuit  patterns  and
         defects for  013micron  and smaller  processes  in july of 2001  an
         upgrade to the 2350 was introduced the 2351 which offers enhancements
         in sensitivity throughput and ease of use

         highspeed laser scattering inspection

                  our  ait  wafer   inspection   family  is  designed  for  high
         throughput  and low  cost of  ownership  coo  providing  fast  and
         accurate feedback on process tool performance as well as advanced line
         monitoring for films cmp and noncritical etch and photo modules the
         ait  series  uses  patented  doubledarkfield  technology  which  is a
         lowangle  illumination  technique particularly effective for detecting
         defects on planar surfaces such as postcmp wafers first introduced in
         1995  the ait platform has been  continually  enhanced  over the years
         with  increasing  levels of  sensitivity  and throughput to address the
         inspection needs for 013micron and smaller design rules

                  in june  2001  we  unveiled  the ait xp  which  took our ait
         inspection family to a whole new level of performance with its ability
         to dynamically  adjust and optimize  inspection  speed and sensitivity
         while  filtering  out  nuisance  defects  the ait xp delivers  maximum
         sensitivity to all die regions in a single pass the system can scan an
         entire wafer in as little as 80 seconds with the sensitivity  needed to
         inspect advanced devices incorporating 010micron 100nm and smaller
         design rules

         ebeam inspection

                  sems  use an  electron  beam  to  image  and  measure  surface
         features  on a  semiconductor  wafer at a much higher  resolution  than
         images  captured by optical  microscopes  as the industry moves deeper
         into the  sub015micron  copper  device realm  sembased  inspection
         becomes mandatory for accelerating  yield ramps  klatencor  pioneered
         this  market  with the  introduction  of the  industrys  first  ebeam
         inspection  system  nearly 10 years ago in 1999 we unveiled the es20
         the first scanning ebeam wafer inspection  system optimized for use in
         fullvolume  production  the following year we introduced the es20xp
         which delivers  further  improvements in sensitivity  while  increasing
         throughput to enable true production line monitoring of sub013micron
         semiconductor manufacturing klatencor leveraged more than 25 years of
         experience in wafer inspection to bring this latest tool to market

         optical and ebeam defect review

                  our defect review  capability  includes  optical  confocal and
         ebeam scanning technology  in 1995 we introduced the crstm optical
         review   system   which   enables   highspeed   defect   review   and
         classification  on both  patterned  and  unpatterned  200 mm and 300 mm
         wafers at a low coo in 2000  we  introduced  the ev300 defect  review
         systeman  advanced  automated  sem  designed  to gather and  analyze
         defect  excursion  information  as well as report the results with the
         improved  sensitivity required at 013micron and smaller design rules
         the  ev300  supplements  optical  review  by  providing   topographical
         information  enabling more accurate defect  classification than can be
         achieved by optical review systems alone

         inline non contact electrical defect monitoring

                  the increasing  complexity of ic manufacturing  has given rise
         to a greater  number of electrical  defects  causing  device  failure
         accelerating   yield   learning  for  the   backendofline   process
         especially  in the  development  and early  ramp  phases  is made more
         difficult by the task of isolating these yieldkilling defects from the
         thousands of  nonrelevant  defects  induced by material  anomaliesan
         extremely  timeconsuming process that can take from two to eight weeks
         to complete per yieldlearning cycle

                  our breakthrough ulooptm methodology  introduced in october
         2001  provides a fabwide  framework of solutions that accelerate time
         to yield  through an  aggressive  merger of  inspection  metrology and
         electrical  test data  edo  the first  product  in the uloop  family
         combines  noncontact  electrical  test with  inline  physical  defect
         inspection to produce the fastest rootcause  analysis method available
         in the industry today  using edo  chipmakers can reduce the length of
         their yieldlearning  cycles down to only a few days this new approach
         represents an integrated turnkey solution to electrical inspection that
         increases  the  speed  and  effectiveness  of  rootcause  analysis  by
         detecting and imaging electrical defects quickly  while minimizing the
         engineering  resources required to gather and assimilate the rootcause

         unpatterned wafer inspection

                  in 1997  we  introduced  the surfscan  sp1tm for bare wafer
         qualification    process    monitoring   and   equipment    monitoring
         applications it provides the high sensitivity fast throughput and low
         coo required in a production environment  and is used in virtually all
         semiconductor   manufacturing   processes  the  sp1tbi  triple  beam
         illumination was introduced in 1998 and was designed with additional
         optical  configurations  needed to detect  submicron  defects on metal
         films and rough surfaces while still providing sensitivity below 100 nm
         on polished  silicon  the sp1tbi is also used for detecting defects on
         nonuniform  films a critical  requirement  for cmp  applications  in
         1999 we introduced a surface nanotopography measurement capability for
         the sp1  that  enhances  lithography  and cmp  process  monitoring  for
         013micron process  development  in 2001 we unveiled the sp1dls the
         first 300 mm tool to provide brightfield  darkfield and nanotopography
         defect  information in a single scan it has the sensitivity to capture
         the widest  variety  of  defects  as small as 50 nm at high  throughput
         speeds of up to 125 wafers per hour

         macro afterdevelop inspection

                  in  1999  we  became  the  first  to  automate  afterdevelop
         inspection  adi for macro defects with the introduction of the 2401
         macro defect inspection system  designed to replace inefficient manual
         macro adi the 2401 is the industrys first fully automated  inspection
         system  able  to  detect  and  classify  frontend  macro  lithographic
         defects  which are 50 microns  and larger in size  manual adi methods
         may  capture  only 20 percent of  photorelated  defects as a result of
         wafer complexity  background  patterning noise and human fatigue  in
         contrast  the 2401 captures more than 90 percent of all critical macro
         adi defects  while providing  comprehensive defect  classification and
         yield  information to dramatically  reduce scrap and enable  continuous
         process improvements

                  in 2001  we  introduced  the 2430  macro  adi  series  which
         brought the benefits of the 2401s advanced analysis capabilities high
         throughput  and advanced  detection  algorithms  to 300 mm  production
         macro defects  which can ruin the entire wafer are especially  costly
         to chipmakers in 300 mm production since more than twice the number of
         die are at risk with these larger  wafers as compared to 200 mm wafers
         the 2430 is the first  automated  macro adi  system on the market to be
         fully compliant with i300i standards for complete integration and rapid
         deployment in 300 mm fabs

         backside wafer inspection

                  in 2002 we unveiled a new backside inspection module bsim
         option for the surfscan sp1 series that provides the  industrys  first
         fully automated  nondestructive inspection solution for the backsides
         of  patterned  production  wafers  wafer  backside  defects can have a
         significant impact on wafer and process  uniformity  both of which are
         critical  issues  in  advanced  300 mm  processing  our  field  trials
         indicate that these backside  defects can arise at nearly every process
         step  and account for as much as 10 percent of a fabs  baseline yield
         lossamounting  to millions of dollars  annually in lost revenue  the
         surfscan  sp1  with  bsim  enables  automated   nondestructive  wafer
         backside  inspection  to be  incorporated  as a routine step into every
         process  module  in  order  to  recover  these  yield  losses  and help
         chipmakers further realize the economic gains in moving to 300 mm

         reticle inspection

                  our reticle  inspection systems look for possible defects that
         could be transmitted  to the design pattern on the wafer  reticles are
         high  precision  quartz  plates  that  contain  microscopic  images  of
         electronic circuits  placed into steppers or scanners  these reticles
         are used to transfer  circuit  patterns  onto wafers to fabricate  ics
         errorfree  reticles are the first step in ensuring  high yields in the
         manufacturing  process  since  defects in reticles can be replicated on
         wafers  reticle  inspection is becoming  increasingly  critical as the
         industry  moves to deep  subwavelength  lithography  013  micron and
         below  where the feature  sizes  printed on wafers are  significantly
         smaller  than the  wavelength  of light used in the stepper or scanner
         this  extension of the  lithography  process  results in the mask error
         enhancement  factor  where reticle  defects once too small to print on
         the  wafer  become  enhanced  in  the  lithography  process  to  create
         yieldkilling  wafer  defects  we pioneered  the market for  automated
         inspection   of  reticles   and   photomasks   for  the   semiconductor
         manufacturing  industry  over two  decades  ago  and  continue to be a
         market  leader  in  addressing  our  customers   evolving   inspection
         requirements

                  our latestgeneration reticle inspection system terastartm
         was  unveiled  in  2000  and has  since  proved  to be one of the  most
         successful  launches  in our  companys  history  with its  ability to
         inspect up to a  terapixel  one  million by one  million  pixels  per
         reticle terastar provides a threefold increase in throughput compared
         to previous generation systems  and can detect critical killer defects
         as small as 100 nmmaking it ideal for inspecting  advanced  multidie
         reticles used in highvolume ic production

         optical overlay

                  decreasing linewidths larger die sizes and increasing numbers
         of layers in  semiconductor  devices  all  affect  the  tolerances  for
         layertolayer   matching  or  overlay  and  can  result  in  overlay
         misregistration  errorsa  crucial  cause  of  yield  loss  metrology
         systems are needed to measure the alignment between different layers of
         the semiconductor  device to ensure overlay  parameters are kept within
         specification

                  klatencors  overlay  metrology  systems are more tolerant of
         process  and  substrate  reflectivity  variations  than  other  optical
         systems  and  provide  the  measurements  that our  customers  need to
         finetune their lithography  systems to compensate for these errors and
         improve   process   yield   in  february   2001   we   unveiled   our
         latestgeneration  overlay  metrology  system  the  archer  10  which
         enables highly precise and accurate  measurements to within 2 nm while
         providing  one of the  industrys  most  competitive  costofownership
         overlay tools for sub013 micron and 300 mm production to augment the
         performance  of the archer 10 we  introduced a new software  tool this
         past  july  called  archer  analyzer  that  conducts  fully  automated
         realtime  ontool overlay metrology analysis  seamlessly  integrated
         with  the  archer  10  archer   analyzer   provides   missioncritical
         information  such as wafer lot  dispositioning  and stepper correction
         data which helps  chipmakers  eliminate  unnecessary  wafer rework and
         quickly  address  variations in the  performance  of their  lithography

         increased yields and optimum device performance

         process window monitoring

                  over time  optimal  focus and  exposure  settings for a given
         lithography cell and process can drift and change in a variety of ways
         such as cd variations  during the patterning  process  which result in
         significant  yield  losses   knowing  not  just  the  optimal  process
         settings  but also the size of the process window and the  sensitivity
         to process variation  is now critical for stable and efficient pattern

         process and significantly reduce their yield losses

                  in 1999 we  introduced  our impact  xptm  automated  defect
         classification adc software which provides consistent and accurate
         classification  of   yieldlimiting   defects  to  help  our  customers
         accelerate their ramp to higher process yields  impact xp incorporates
         our   smartgallerytm   setup  tool  which  reduces  the  setup  time
         associated  with adc  implementation  in fabs by as much as 70 percent
         this  is  a  critical  requirement   particularly  for  foundries  and
         application  specific  integrated circuit asic  manufacturers  who
         specialize  in  short  runs  of  multiple   products   our  real  time
         classificationtm rtc and inline adc iadc technologies which
         provide  classification and binning of defect types in real time during
         inspection  are  critical  features  on all  of our  latestgeneration
         ebeam and optical inspection tools

                  in 2001  we  introduced  our new recipe  management  service
         called  irecipetm  which  allows  factory  engineers  to quickly and
         easily access existing  recipes and associated  information that reside
         on a central  database from any personal  computer that is connected to
         the fab  intranet  by  integrating  irecipe  into  their fab  network

         with the remote diagnostics capabilities offered by isupport customers
         can achieve such  benefits as improved  tool  productivity  and overall
         equipment effectiveness as well as lower coo

                  this past june we unveiled our new ipartnertm  portfolio of
         customer support offerings which leverages a combination of online and
         onsite  resources to cut customer service costs while at the same time
         boosting tool uptime  based on our isupport  technology  the ipartner
         program takes a tiered  approach that allows  customers to scale at any
         time to the  support  level that  matches  their  unique  and  evolving
         manufacturing  requirements  it is designed to factor in the change in
         service  and  support  requirements  that occur as process  and product
         cycles mature  with 7x24 ipartner online support  customers work with
         klatencors  online  engineers to resolve common issues  reducing the
         need for onsite  dispatch  thereby reducing costs to the customer and
         increasing  tool  uptime  even when an  onsite  visit is  needed  for
         complex issues  klatencor  online engineers  diagnose the problem and
         then identify and order the necessary  parts so that the local customer
         support  engineer arrives onsite with the solution and needed parts in

data storage industry

         outside the semiconductor industry klatencor manufactures  sells and
services  yield  management  solutions to the data storage  market  in 2001 we
acquired  phase  metrics  the  leading  supplier  of   inspectioncertification
technologies to the data storage industry the acquisition marks the latest move
in our plan to leverage our core  competencies  and  leadership  position in the
global semiconductor  industry to create similar  industryleading  positions in
other advanced technology markets

         phase  metrics  tools  and  technologies  complement  the  worldclass
klatencor  systems that already serve as benchmarks for disk and thin film head
metrology  whereas klatencors  demonstrated technology and expertise focus on
frontend data storage  metrology and  inspection  phase metrics  efforts have
been focused on data storage  backend  inspection  and test by leveraging  the
naturally synergistic products and services from both companies  in tandem with
their joint sales  marketing and customer support channels  the newly combined
entity is expected to create the single  largest yield  management  force in the
data storage industry

customers

         to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant
presence throughout the united states  europe  asiapacific and japan staffed
with  local  sales  and  applications  engineers  customer  and  field  service
engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers
leading semiconductor  manufacturers from each of these regions in fiscal 2002
2001 and 2000  no single  customer  accounted  for more than 10  percent of our
revenues

         our business  depends upon the capital  expenditures  of  semiconductor
manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand
for ics and  products  utilizing  ics  we do not  consider  our  business to be
seasonal in nature  but it is cyclical  with  respect to the capital  equipment
procurement  practices  of  semiconductor  manufacturers  and is impacted by the
investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns
in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a
material adverse effect on our future business and financial results

sales service and marketing

         our sales  service  and  marketing  efforts  are  focused on  building
longterm  relationships with our customers  we focus on providing a single and
comprehensive  resource  for the full  breadth  of  process  control  and  yield
management products and services customers benefit from the simplified planning
and coordination  as well as the increased  equipment  compatibility found when
dealing with a single supplier  our revenues are derived primarily from product
sales  principally  through our direct  sales  force and  to a lesser  extent
through distributors

         we believe that the size and  location of our field sales  service and
applications  engineering  and marketing  organizations represent a competitive
advantage  in our  served  markets  we have  direct  sales  forces in the us
europe asiapacific and japan we maintain an export compliance program that is
designed to fully meet the requirements of the us  departments of commerce and
state

         as of  june  30  2002  we  employed  over  2600  sales  and  related
personnel  service engineers and applications  engineers  in addition to sales
and service  offices in us  we conduct  sales  marketing and services out of
whollyowned  subsidiaries  or  branches  of us  subsidiaries  in a variety of
countries  including china france germany israel italy japan south korea
malaysia  singapore  taiwan  thailand and the united  kingdom  international
sales  accounted for  approximately  67 66 and 70 of our revenues in fiscal
2002 2001 and 2000 respectively additional information regarding our revenues
from  foreign  operations  for our last three fiscal  years is  incorporated  by
reference  from note 10 of the notes to the  consolidated  financial  statements
found under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual
report on form 10k

         we  believe  that  sales  outside  the  us  will  continue  to  be  a
significant  percentage of our revenues  our future performance will depend in
part  on our ability to continue to compete  successfully  in asia  one of the
largest markets for the sale of yield management  services in process monitoring
equipment   our  ability  to  compete  in  this  area  is  dependent  upon  the
continuation of favorable trading  relationships between countries in the region
especially taiwan china japan and south korea and the united states and our
continuing   ability  to  maintain   satisfactory   relationships  with  leading
semiconductor companies in the region

         international  sales  and  operations  may  be  adversely  affected  by
imposition  of  governmental   controls   restrictions  on  export  technology
political   instability   trade  restrictions   changes  in  tariffs  and  the
difficulties associated with staffing and managing international  operations in
addition  international  sales  may  be  adversely  affected  by  the  economic
conditions in each country  the revenues  from our  international  business may
also be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates although we attempt
to manage the currency  risk inherent in  nondollar  sales  through  hedging
there can be no assurance  that such efforts  will be  adequate  these  factors
could  have a  material  adverse  effect on our future  business  and  financial
results

backlog

         our backlog for system shipments totaled 599 million at june 30 2002
compared to 724 million at june 30 2001  we include in our backlog only those
customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment
dates within twelve months in addition  we exclude from backlog any orders for
nonreleased  products  we expect to fill the present  backlog of orders during
fiscal 2003  however  all orders are subject to  cancellation  or delay by the
customer  with  limited  or no  penalty  due to  possible  customer  changes in
delivery  schedules and to cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular
date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period

research and development

         the market  for yield  management  and  process  monitoring  systems is
characterized by rapid technological  development and product innovation  these
technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles
and  appropriate   professional   staffing  we  believe  continued  and  timely
development of new products and enhancements to existing  products are necessary
to maintain  our  competitive  position  accordingly  we devote a  significant
portion  of our  human and  financial  resources  to  research  and  development
programs  and seek to maintain  close  relationships  with  customers  to remain
responsive to their needs as part of our customer  relationships  we may enter
into  certain  strategic   development  and  engineering  programs  whereby  our
customers offset certain of our research and development costs

         our key research and  development  activities  during  fiscal year 2002
involved   development  of  process  control  and  yield  management   equipment
especially  reticle inspection and advanced wafer inspection for smaller feature
sizes  copperbased  devices and 300mm wafers  for  information  regarding our
research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years  including
costs offset by our strategic development and engineering  programs  see item 7
managements  discussion  and  analysis of financial  condition  and results of
operations in this annual report on form 10k

         in order to make continuing developments in the semiconductor industry
we  are  committed  to  significant  engineering  efforts  toward  both  product
improvement  and  new  product  development   new  product   introductions  may
contribute  to  fluctuations  in operating  results  since  customers may defer
ordering  existing  products  if  new  products  have  reliability  or  quality
problems  those  problems may result in reduced  orders  higher  manufacturing
costs  delays in  acceptance  of and payment for new  products  and  additional
service and warranty expenses on occasion we have experienced  reliability and
quality problems in connection with certain product introductions  resulting in
some of these consequences  there can be no assurance that we will successfully
develop and manufacture new hardware and software products or that new hardware
and software products  introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace  if
we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be
affected adversely

manufacturing raw materials and supplies

         we perform system design  assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an
outsourcing  strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies
our  inhouse  manufacturing  activities  consist  primarily of  assembling  and
testing  components  and  subassemblies  that are acquired  through  thirdparty
vendors and integrating  those  subassemblies  into our finished  products  our
principal  manufacturing  activities  take  place  in  san  jose  and  milpitas
california  with additional  operations in bedford  massachusetts  san diego
hayward and fremont  california  and migdal  haemek  israel  as of june 30
2002  we  employed  approximately  1300  manufacturing  and 1200  engineering
personnel

         many of the parts components and subassemblies  collectively parts
are standard commercial products  although certain items are made to klatencor
specifications  we use numerous vendors to supply parts for the manufacture and
support of our  products  although  we make  reasonable  efforts to ensure that
these parts are available from multiple suppliers  this is not always possible
and certain  parts  included  in our systems may be obtained  only from a single
supplier or a limited  group of  suppliers  we endeavor to minimize the risk of
production  interruption by selecting and qualifying  alternative  suppliers for
key parts  by  monitoring  the  financial  condition  of key  suppliers  and by
ensuring   adequate   inventories   of  key  parts  are  available  to  maintain
manufacturing schedules

         although we seek to reduce our  dependence  on sole and limited  source
suppliers  in some  cases the  partial  or  complete  loss of  certain of these
sources  could  disrupt  scheduled  deliveries  to customers and have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and damage customer relationships

competition

         the worldwide market for process control and yield  management  systems
is highly competitive  in each of our product markets we face competition from
established and potential competitors some of which may have greater financial
research  engineering  manufacturing and marketing  resources than us such as
applied  materials  inc and hitachi  electronics  engineering co ltd we may
also face future  competition  from new market  entrants from other overseas and
domestic  sources  we expect our  competitors to continue to improve the design
and  performance  of their  current  products and processes and to introduce new
products and processes with improved price and performance  characteristics  we
believe  that to  remain  competitive  we will  require  significant  financial
resources to offer a broad range of products  to maintain  customer service and
support  centers  worldwide  and to invest in product and process  research  and
development

         significant  competitive  factors in the market for process control and
yield management systems include system performance  ease of use  reliability
installed base and technical  service and support  we believe that while price
and  delivery are  important  competitive  factors  the  customers  overriding
requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and

page

highly  accurate  inspection  and  metrology  capabilities  into their  existing
manufacturing processes thereby enhancing productivity

         our process control and yield management  systems for the semiconductor
industry  are  intended  to  compete  based  upon   performance   and  technical
capabilities   these   systems  may  compete  with  less   expensive  and  more
laborintensive manual inspection devices

         management believes that klatencor is a strong competitor with respect
to both its products and services  however  any loss of  competitive  position
could negatively impact our prices  customer orders  revenues  gross margins
and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and
financial condition

acquisitions

         we continue to pursue a course of strategic  acquisitions and alliances
to expand our technologies  product offerings and distribution capabilities in
fiscal 2002 we acquired substantially all of the assets of qc optics inc qc
optics  a manufacturer of laserbased  inspection  systems for semiconductor
flat panel and computer hard disk manufacturing industries

         the financial  position and results of  operations of this  acquisition
were  immaterial in relation to those of  klatencor  and this  transaction  was
accounted for as a purchase further details of our acquisitions during the last
three  fiscal  years are  included  in note 3 of the  notes to the  consolidated
financial statements found under item 8 financial statements and supplementary
data in this annual report on form 10k

         acquisitions  involve numerous risks  including  management issues and
costs in  connection  with  integration  of the  operations  technologies  and
products of the acquired companies possible writedowns of impaired assets and
the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies  the inability to
manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and
financial condition

patents and other proprietary rights

         we protect our proprietary  technology through reliance on a variety of
intellectual  property laws  including patent  copyright and trade secrets we
have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united  states and abroad and
intend to  continue to pursue the legal  protection  of our  technology  through
intellectual  property laws in addition  from time to time we acquire  license
rights  under us  and foreign  patents and other  proprietary  rights of third
parties

         due to the rapid pace of  innovation  within the  process  control  and
yield management systems industry  we believe that our protection of patent and
other  intellectual  property  rights is less important than factors such as our
technological   expertise   continuing  development  of  new  systems   market
penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and
service to customers
page

         no  assurance  can be given that  patents  will be issued on any of our
applications  that license  assignments will be made as anticipated or that our
patents  licenses or other  proprietary  rights will be  sufficiently  broad to
protect our technology  no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or
licensed by us will not be challenged  invalidated or  circumvented or that the
rights  granted  thereunder  will provide us with a  competitive  advantage  in
addition  there  can be no  assurance  that we will  be  able  to  protect  our
technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar
or functionally competitive technology

employees

         as of june  30  2002  we  employed  a total  of  approximately  5700
persons  none  of our  employees  are  represented  by a labor  union  we have
experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

         competition   is  intense  in  the   recruiting  of  personnel  in  the
semiconductor and semiconductor  equipment industry  we believe that our future
success  will  depend  in part on our  continued  ability  to  hire  and  retain
qualified management marketing and technical employees

item 3  legal proceedings

         we are named  from time to time as a party to  lawsuits  in the  normal
course of our business  litigation  in general and intellectual  property and
securities  litigation in particular  can be expensive and disruptive to normal
business  operations  moreover  the results of complex legal  proceedings  are
difficult to predict  we believe that we have defenses in each of the cases set
forth below and are vigorously contesting each of these matters

ade corporation

         on october 11 2000 ade  corporation  ade  a competitor  filed a
patent  infringement  lawsuit against  klatencor in the us  district court in
delaware  ade claimed  damages and sought an injunction  under us  patent no
6118525 525 patent we filed a counterclaim in the same court alleging that
ade has infringed  four of our patents  we are seeking  damages and a permanent
injunction  against  ade in  addition  we are seeking a  declaration  from the
district court that ades patent is invalid and not infringed by klatencor  on
october 22 2001 we filed a separate  action for declaratory  judgment  against
ade in the northern  district of california  requesting a declaration  that us
patent no 6292259 259 patent is invalid and not infringed that action has
now been consolidated with the prior action in the delaware proceeding  and ade
has amended its  complaint  in that  proceeding  to allege  that  klatencor  is
infringing the 259 patent on august 8 2002 the magistrate presiding over the
action issued a recommendation that the court enter summary judgment in favor of
klatencor on the issue of noninfringement under ades 525 patent on the same
day the magistrate issued recommendations that the court enter summary judgment
in favor of ade on the issue of noninfringement of two of klatencors patents
while we cannot predict the outcome  we believe that we have valid defenses and
further believe that our counterclaims have merit

tokyo seimitsu co ltd

         on june 27  2001we sued tokyo  seimitsu co ltd and tsk america inc
tsk  a competitor  in the us  district court in the northern district of
california alleging that tsk infringes on one of the companys patents the suit
seeks damages and an injunction  under us patent no  4805123 123 patent
tsk filed a counterclaim  in the same court seeking a declaration  that the 123
patent is invalid  unenforceable and not infringed and also alleged violations
of the antitrust and unfair competition laws

         although  we cannot  predict  the  outcome of these  claims  we do not
believe that any of these legal matters will have a material  adverse  effect on
klatencor  were an  unfavorable  ruling to occur in one or more of the pending
claims  there  exists the  possibility  of a material  impact on our  operating
results for the period in which the ruling occurred

item 7 managements  discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

         the  following  discussion  of our  financial  condition and results of
operations  should  be read  in  conjunction  with  our  consolidated  financial
statements and the related notes included in item 8  financial  statements and
supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains
forwardlooking  statements  which involve risk and  uncertainties  our actual
results could differ  materially  from those  anticipated in the forward looking
statements  as a result of certain  factors  including but not limited to those
discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and the use of estimates

         the preparation of our consolidated  financial statements in conformity
with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the united states of america
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of
contingent  assets and liabilities  we based these estimates and assumptions on
historical  experience  and evaluate  them on an ongoing  basis to ensure they
remain  reasonable  under current  conditions  actual results could differ from
those  estimates  we discuss the  development  and  selection  of the  critical
accounting  estimates  with the audit  committee  of our board of directors on a
quarterly basis  and the audit committee has reviewed the companys  disclosure
relating to them in this annual report on form 10k  the items in our financial
statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows

         revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement  exists  the sale  price is fixed  or  determinable  delivery  has
occurred or services  rendered  and  collectibility is reasonably  assured  we
changed our interpretation of delivery based on guidance provided in sec staff
accounting  bulletin no 101 sab 101 effective july 1 2000 prior to adoption
of sab 101 we generally recognized system revenue when title transferred to the
customer mostly upon shipment  system revenue includes  hardware and software
that is incidental to the product  we now generally  recognize  system  revenue
upon positive affirmation by the customer that the system has been installed and
is  operating   according  to  predetermined   specifications   this  positive
affirmation  is generally  evidenced  by an  acceptance  document  signed by the
customer  this change has the impact of prolonging the cycle time between order
placement and revenue  recognition  in limited  cases  we allow for exceptions
where we recognize  system  revenue upon shipment if acceptance is not required
however  these exceptions have accounted for less than 25 of our revenue this
year see note 1 of notes to consolidated  financial  statements under revenue
recognition for detailed description of exceptions

         revenue  from  software  license  fees  is  typically  recognized  upon
shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable the fee is fixed
or determinable  and  vendorspecific  objective  evidence exists to allocate a
portion of the total fee to any undelivered  elements of the  arrangement  such
undelivered elements in these arrangements  typically consist of services andor

page
upgrades  if  vendorspecific   objective  evidence  does  not  exist  for  the
undelivered  elements of the  arrangement  all  revenue is deferred  until such
evidence does exist or until all elements are delivered  whichever is earlier
in instances  where an  arrangement  to deliver  software  requires  significant
modification or customization  license fees are recognized under the percentage
of completion  method of contract  accounting  allowances are  established  for
potential product returns and credit losses to date  revenue from license fees
has been less than 10 of total revenue

         revenue  from the sale of spare  parts  is  recognized  upon  shipment
service  and  maintenance  revenue is  recognized  ratably  over the term of the
maintenance contract

         the  deferred  system  profit  balance  as of june  30  2002  was 194
million  this amount  equals the amount of  deferred  system  revenue  that was
invoiced and due on shipment and deferred under sab 101 less applicable  product
and warranty costs the deferred  profit  balance  decreased from 422 million at
june 30 2001 primarily  because  shipments  were lower than revenue  recognized
during fiscal 2002

         we also  defer the fair value of  nonstandard  warranty  bundled  with
equipment sales as unearned  revenue  nonstandard  warranty  includes services
incremental  to the  standard  40hour  per week  coverage  for  twelve  months
nonstandard  warranty  is  recognized  ratably as revenue  when the  applicable
warranty term period commences  the unearned revenue balance decreased from 71
million at june 30 2001 to 55 million at june 30  2002  primarily  due to the
reduction of system revenue from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002

         inventory  reserves we review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on
a quarterly basis for production  inventory  our methodology involves matching
our onhand and onorder  inventory with our build forecast over the next twelve
months the matching is done on a partbypart basis we then evaluate the parts
found to be in excess of the twelvemonth  demand and take appropriate  reserves
to reflect the risk of  obsolescence  for spare parts  inventory  we match our
onhand  inventory  against  twentyfour  months of usage  we then evaluate the
parts in excess of the twentyfour month usage and take appropriate  reserves to
reflect risk of obsolescence  both methodologies are significantly  affected by
the usage  assumption  the longer the time period of  estimated  usage the less
reserves  are  required   based  on  our  past   experience   we  believe  the
twelvemonthtwentyfour   month  time   periods   best   reflect   the  average
obsolescence  risks  given the highly  cyclical  nature and  volatility  in our
product  demand  and spare  parts  usage  we  occasionally  have to adjust  our
reserves as actual system demandspare parts usage varies

         allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our trade receivables are
derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout
the world  in order to monitor  potential  credit  losses  we perform  ongoing
credit  evaluations  of our  customers  financial  condition  an allowance for
doubtful  accounts is  maintained  for  potential  credit  losses based upon our
assessment  of the  expected  collectibility  of all  accounts  receivable  the
allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed  periodically to assess the adequacy
of the allowance  we take into  consideration 1 any circumstances of which we
are aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations and 2 a
certain percentage of the accounts  receivable balance which is based on the age
of the receivables and our historical  experience  if circumstances change and

page
the financial  condition of our customers were adversely  affected  resulting in
their inability to meet their  financial  obligations to us we may need to take
additional allowances

         warranty  we provide  standard  warranty  coverage  on our  systems for
twelve months  providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during
the warranty period  we account for the estimated  warranty cost as a charge to
cost of sales when revenue is recognized  the estimated  warranty cost is based
on historical product  performance and field expenses  utilizing actual service
records we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and
apply the actual labor and overhead  rates to determine the  estimated  warranty
charge we update these estimated  charges every six months  the actual product
performance  andor field  expense  profiles  may differ  and in those cases we
adjust our warranty reserves  accordingly  the difference between the estimated
and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product  introductions  for
which there is limited or no historical product performance on which to base the
estimated warranty expense more mature products with longer product performance
histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates  nonstandard
warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40hour per week coverage
for twelve months  nonstandard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is
recognized  ratably  as  revenue  when  the  applicable   warranty  term  period
commences

         contingencies  and  litigation  we are  currently  named  as a party to
various legal  proceedings  including  those outlined in part i item 3 legal
proceedings in this annual report on form 10k while we currently believe the
ultimate outcome of these  proceedings  both individually and in the aggregate
will not have a material  adverse effect on our financial  position or operating
results  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict  we
would accrue the cost of an adverse judgment if in our estimation  the adverse
settlement is probable and we can  reasonably  estimate the ultimate cost to us
we have made no such accruals as of june 30 2002

results of operations

         during fiscal 2002 we continued to face a significant  downturn in the
semiconductor  industry  which started early in calendar year 2001  for several
quarters  there has been a  worldwide  softening  in demand for  semiconductors
resulting in excess capacity and reduced demand for semiconductor  manufacturing
equipment

revenues and gross margin

         product  revenue  decreased  479 million  or 25 to 143 billion in
fiscal 2002 from 191  billion in fiscal 2001  product  revenue  declines were
mostly the result of reduced  capital  spending  as a result of a  semiconductor
industry downturn product revenue in fiscal 2001 increased 568 million or 42
to 191  billion  from  134  billion  in  fiscal  2000  as a result  of the
continued  recovery of new order and net sales over the  previous  year as major
semiconductor  manufacturers expanded facilities for additional capacity and new
technology  in fiscal 2002  international revenue slightly increased to 69 of
revenue  from 67 in the prior year  due to higher demand in japan and western
europe   partially   offset  by  lower  demand  in  taiwan   in  fiscal  2001
international  revenue decreased to 67 of revenue from 72 in fiscal 2000 due
to lower demand in western europe taiwan and japan
page
         service revenue is generated from  maintenance  service  contracts  as
well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the
expiration of the warranty  period  service  revenues  were 209 million  196
million  and 159 million in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000  respectively  service
revenue continued to increase throughout the 3yearperiod as our installed base
of equipment at our  customers  sites  continued to grow the amount of service
revenue  generated  is  generally  proportional  to the number of  postwarranty
systems installed at our customers sites and the degree of utilization of those
systems

         gross  margins as a  percentage  of revenues  were 50  55 and 55 in
fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000  respectively  the decrease in fiscal 2002 compared
to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to reduced capacity utilization resulting from
lower business volume and an increased percentage of revenue in the lower margin
service  business  as  well  as  factory  underabsorption  and  higher  excess
inventory  writeoffs  due to lower business  levels  the gross margin ratio in
fiscal 2001 remained flat compared to fiscal 2000

engineering research and development

         net engineering  research and development  expenses were 287 million
356 million  and 246 million or 18 17 and 16 of revenues in fiscal 2002
2001 and 2000 respectively  the dollars decreased in fiscal 2002 compared to
fiscal  2001  primarily  due  to  temporary  shutdowns  management  pay  cuts
reductions in temporary labor and  discretionary  spending as well as other cost
saving  measures  implemented  over the last year the dollar increase in fiscal
2001  compared  to  fiscal  2000  was  primarily   attributable  to  increased
investment in new  technologies  associated  with our ongoing efforts to develop
products which address new market  segments  enhancements to existing  products
including  nextgeneration  300mm  products  and  inspection  enhancements  for
subquarter micron technology

         net  engineering  research and  development  expenses  were  partially
offset by 14 million  8 million and 16 million in external  funding received
under  certain  strategic  development  programs  conducted  with several of our
customers and government grants in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively

         our future operating  results will depend  significantly on our ability
to produce  products and provide  services that have a competitive  advantage in
our  marketplace  to do  this  we  believe  that  we  must  continue  to  make
substantial  investments  in our research  and  development  efforts  we remain
committed to product development in new and emerging  technologies as we address
the requirements of 018 micron and 013 micron feature sizes realtime review
and the transition to copper  technology  our investments in new technology and
existing product  enhancements are intended to enable our customers to achieve a
higher  return on their  capital  investments  and higher  productivity  through
costeffective leading edge technology solutions

selling general and administrative

         selling  general and administrative  expenses were 291 million  354
million and 268 million or 18 17 and 18 of revenues in fiscal 2002 2001
page
and 2000  respectively  the decrease in dollars in fiscal 2002 as compared to
fiscal 2001  was primarily  due to temporary  shutdowns  management  pay cuts
reductions in temporary labor and discretionary  spending as well as other cost
saving  measures  implemented  over the last year  the  increase  in dollars in
fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000  was  primarily due to increased  costs
associated with the growth in revenues

acquisitions

         during the three years ended june 30  2002  we  completed a number of
purchase  acquisitions   the  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the
operating  results  of each  business  from the date of  acquisition  pro forma
results of  operations  have not been  presented  because  the  effects of these
acquisitions were not material on either an individual or aggregate basis for a
period of up to twelve  months  from the  acquisition  date  we may  change our
original  purchase price  allocation for  preacquisition  uncertainties  after
twelve  months   we  record  the  fair  value  of  such  reasonably   estimable
contingencies

         the  amounts   allocated  to   inprocess   research  and   development
inprocess rd were determined through established  valuation  techniques in
the  hightechnology  equipment  industry  and were  expensed  upon  acquisition
because   technology   feasibility  had  not  been  established  and  no  future
alternative uses existed amounts allocated to goodwill and purchased intangible
assets are amortized on a  straightline  basis over periods not exceeding  five
years

         a  summary  of  purchase   transactions  is  outlined  as  follows  in

semiconductor flat panel and computer hard disk manufacturing industries

2 we acquired certain assets and  technology of phase  metrics the leading  supplier of  inspectioncertification  products in
the data storage industry

3 fab solutions provided us with apc software allowing our customers to automatically  compensate for variances in the ic
manufacturing process

4 with the finle  acquisition  we developed our klarity  prodata  lithography  data analysis  software  which  combined with the
prolith lithography data analysis software helps our customers reduce their advanced lithography development time and cost

5 acmes  technology  enabled us to develop the klarity ace product  which  helps our  customers  quickly  identify  the source of
defects and process problems fabwide

restructuring and other charges

         in fiscal 2002 there were no restructuring charges in fiscal 2001 in
response  to the  downturn  in the  semiconductor  industry  we  implemented  a
restructuring plan to reduce spending charges related to our restructuring plan
included  facilities of 47  million  severance and benefits of 16 million
and other costs of 10 million  due to our  downsizing  and  consolidation  of
certain of our  operations  we vacated two of our leased  office  buildings and
included the remaining net book value of the related  leasehold  improvements as
well as the future lease payments  net of anticipated  sublease  revenue in the
charge  we  reduced  our  workforce  by  approximately  5  primarily  in  the
manufacturing   areas   and  recorded   severance   charges  related  to  these
terminations  in addition  during the fourth  fiscal  quarter of 2001 we sold
software and  intellectual  property  associated with our  isupporttm  online
customer  support  technology and recorded 100 million  pretax  nonrecurring
income  which was netted with the other  nonrecurring  charges as part of the
isupporttm  transaction  we will record a nonrecurring gain of approximately
15 million in the quarter  ending  september  30 2002  during fiscal 2000 we
reversed 8 million of restructuring  reserve that would not be utilized because
of a  change  in  managements  plans  for  utilization  of  certain  facilities
resulting from an increase in demand for our products

         as of june 30 2002 the remaining balance of the restructuring reserve
was 04 million restructuring activity for fiscal 2002 was as follows

         the  semiconductor  equipment  industry  that we operate in is a highly
cyclical  industry  this  cyclical  nature  affects our  ability to  accurately
predict future revenue and thus  future expense levels  we are currently in a
down cycle  and if this current down cycle continues to linger  we may need to
take appropriate actions to scale operating expenses to our business levels

interest income and other net

         interest  income and other  net was 43  million  54 million and 42
million in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively interest income and other
net is comprised primarily of gains realized on sales of marketable  securities
interest  income  earned  on  the  investment  and  cash  portfolio  and  income
recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency  contracts  the decrease
in  fiscal  2002 as  compared  to fiscal  2001 was  primarily  due to  decreased
interest income resulting from declining  interest rates the increase in fiscal
2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily due to increased  interest  income
resulting from higher interest rate and higher average investment balances

provision for income taxes

         klatencors  effective  income tax rate was 25 27 and 28 in fiscal
2002 2001 and 2000  respectively  in general  our effective  income tax rate
differs  from the  statutory  rate of 35  largely  as a  function  of  benefits
realized  from our  extraterritorial  income  eti  exclusion  research  and
development tax credits and income derived from tax exempt interest

         the overall reduction in our effective income tax rate from fiscal 2001
to  fiscal  2002  of 2  was the  result  of a  combination  of  factors  most
importantly  more export sales benefits  more  taxexempt  interest income and
less state tax expense  compared  relatively to these same items as a percentage
of fiscal 2001 pretax income reduced the rate these reductions were partially
offset by more  relative  foreign  tax  expense  the overall  reduction  in our
effective income tax rate from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to a
shift in the geographic composition of our pretax income

         our future effective  income tax rate depends on various factors  such
as tax legislation  the geographic  composition of our pretax income  nontax
deductible  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with  acquisitions  amounts  of
taxexempt  interest income and research and development credits as a percentage
of  aggregate  pretax  income  and  the  effectiveness  of  our  tax  planning
strategies

liquidity and capital resources

         working capital was 932 million as of june 30 2002  compared to 913
million as of june 30 2001  cash cash  equivalents and shortterm  marketable
page
securities at june 30 2002  decreased to 673 million from 697 million at june
30 2001 in addition we maintained 660 million and 447 million in marketable
securities classified as longterm as of june 30 2002 and 2001 respectively

         klatencor  has  historically  financed  its  operations  through  cash
generated  from  operations  cash  provided by  operating  activities  was 284
million  408  million  and 253  million  in  fiscal  2002  2001  and  2000
respectively  the decrease in cash  provided by operating  activities in fiscal
2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was  primarily  due to decreased  income before the
cumulative  effect of accounting  change and lower accounts  payable  partially
offset by lower  accounts  receivable  and  inventory  balances  income  before
cumulative  effect of accounting  change  decreased in fiscal 2002  compared to
fiscal 2001  primarily due to declining  revenues and gross  margins  partially
offset by decreased engineering  selling  general and administrative  expenses
associated  with cost saving  measures in  response  to the  industry  slowdown
accounts  payable  shrank  due to  decreased  expenditures  and  lower  incoming
invoices  accounts  receivable  declined  primarily  due to  strong  collection
efforts  as well as lower  shipments  the  reduction in  inventory  was driven
primarily in production  inventory  where stringent  processes have been put in
place for  managing  material  procurement  the  increase  in cash  provided by
operating activities in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily due to
revenue growth and strong collection in accounts receivable partially offset by
increased  inventory  expenditure  and other  purchases  during fiscal 2002 and
2001 we sold trade notes and accounts  receivable from japanese  customers  at
june 30  2002 and 2001  48 million and 52  million  respectively  of these
receivables  and notes were  outstanding  which have not been  included  in our
consolidated  balance sheet as the criteria for sale  treatment  established  by
sfas 140 have been met under sfas 140 after a transfer of financial assets an
entity  derecognizes  financial  assets when control has been  surrendered  and
derecognizes liabilities when extinguished

         cash used in investing  activities  was 376 million  295 million and
96 million in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000  respectively  investing  activities
typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities
purchases of capital  assets to support  longterm  growth and  acquisitions  of
technology or other companies to allow access to new market segments or emerging
technologies  additions  of  capital  assets  consist  mainly  of  the  planned
completion of our livermore  facilities  we anticipate capital  expenditures in
fiscal  2003 to be  significantly  lower  compared  to  fiscal  2002  due to the
completion of the livermore facilities in fiscal 2002

         we used 9 million and 58 million of cash in financing  activities  in
fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001  respectively  and generated 61 million in fiscal
2000 financing activities typically include sales and repurchases of our common
stock  as well as  borrowings  and  repayments of debt  repurchases  of common
stock  net of  issuance  used 8 million  and 60  million in fiscal  2002 and
fiscal  2001  respectively  issuance  of  common  stock  net of  repurchases
provided 79 million in fiscal 2000

         we have adopted a plan for the  systematic  repurchase of shares of our
common  stock  in  the  open  market  to  reduce  the  dilution  created  by our
stockbased employee benefit and incentive plans in fiscal 2002 we repurchased
3341000  shares of our common  stock at an average  price of 3689 per share
for a total of 123 million in fiscal 2001 we repurchased  4580000 shares of
our common  stock at an average  price of 3354 per share  for a total of 154
page
million in fiscal 2000 we repurchased 520000 shares of our common stock at an
average  price of  5380  per  share  for a total of 28  million  since  the
inception of the  repurchase  program in 1997  through  june 30  2002  we have
repurchased  a total of  11349000  shares at an  average  price of 3257  per
share all such shares remain as treasury shares

         certain of our leased facilities qualify for operating lease accounting
treatment  under sfas 13  accounting for leases and as such the facilities
are not included on our consolidated balance sheet

         the lease  agreement  for  certain  milpitas  and san jose  california
facilities has a term of five years ending in november  2002  with an option to
extend up to two more years  monthly  payments under this lease vary based upon
the london  interbank  offering rate libor plus 042  under the terms of the
lease  we at our option  can acquire the properties at their original cost or
arrange for the properties to be acquired under the terms of the lease we must
maintain compliance with certain financial  covenants  as of the date of filing
of this 10k we were in compliance with all of tour bank  covenants  including
the financial covenants  if we purchase these milpitas and san jose california
facilities  at the  end of the  lease  term  the  purchase  transactions  would
increase land and property  value by  approximately  1193 million and decrease
cash by approximately the same amount consequently  depreciation expense would
increase by approximately  43 million per year rent expense would decrease by
approximately  29  million per year  and interest  income  would  decrease by
approximately  36 million per year  based on current  interest  rates  if we
choose  not to  purchase  the  facilities  we will be liable to the  lessor for
residual value guarantees of an aggregate of up to approximately 1002 million
based on current market conditions  we do not believe that we will have to make
any significant payments associated with the residual value guarantees

         at june 30 2002 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 133
billion of cash cash equivalents and investments our liquidity is affected by
many factors  some of which are based on the normal  ongoing  operations of the
business  and others of which relate to the  uncertainties  of global economies
and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries  although cash
requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors our
management  believes  that cash  generated  from  operations  together with the
liquidity provided by existing cash balances  will be sufficient to satisfy our
liquidity requirements for the next twelve months

         the  following  is  a  schedule  summarizing   klatencor   significant
commitments as of june 30 2002 in millions

         additionally  we maintain certain open inventory purchase  commitments
with our  suppliers  to  ensure a smooth  and  continuous  supply  chain for key
components  our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted
to a forecasted  timehorizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties  this
forecast  timehorizon  can vary amongst  different  suppliers  as such  it is
page
difficult to accurately report our true open commitments at any particular point
in time  however we estimate our open inventory purchase commitment as of june
30 2002 to be no more than 60 million

factors affecting results including risks and uncertainties

fluctuations in operating results and stock price

         our operating  results have varied  widely in the past  and our future
operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon
a wide variety of factors including those listed in this section and throughout
this annual report on form 10k in addition  future operating  results may not
follow any past  trends  we believe  the  factors  that could make our  results
fluctuate and difficult to predict include

o        the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry
o        changing global economic conditions
o        competitive pressure
o        our ability to develop and implement new  technologies and introduction
         of new products
o        our ability to manage our manufacturing requirements
o        intellectual property protection
o        the shortage of qualified workers in the areas in which we operate and
o        worldwide political instability

         operating  results also could be affected by sudden changes in customer
requirements  currency exchange rate fluctuations and other economic conditions
affecting  customer  demand  and the  cost of  operations  in one or more of the
global  markets in which we do business  as a result of these or other factors
we could fail to achieve our  expectations as to future  revenues  gross profit
and income from operations our failure to meet the performance expectations set
and published by external  sources could result in a sudden and significant drop
in the  price of our  stock  particularly  on a  shortterm  basis  and  could
negatively affect the value of any investment in our stock

semiconductor equipment industry volatility

         the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing
decisions of our  customers  are highly  dependent on the  economies of both the
local  markets  in  which  they  are  located  and  the  semiconductor  industry
worldwide  the timing  length and  severity of the  upanddown  cycles in the
semiconductor  equipment industry are difficult to predict this cyclical nature
of the industry in which we operate  affects our ability to  accurately  predict
future revenue and  thus  future expense  levels  when cyclical  fluctuations
result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely
affected and cost reduction  measures may be necessary in order for us to remain
competitive and financially sound during a down cycle we must be in a position
to adjust our cost and expense  structure to prevailing market conditions and to
continue to motivate and retain our key employees  in addition  during periods
of  rapid  growth  we  must  be able to  increase  manufacturing  capacity  and
page
personnel  to meet  customer  demand  we can  provide no  assurance  that these
objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry  cycles  if we
fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed

         currently we are in an industry down cycle we are not able to predict
when  the  semiconductor  industry  will  recover  during  a  down  cycle  the
semiconductor  industry typically  experiences  excess production  capacity that
causes semiconductor manufacturers to decrease capital spending we generally do
not have longterm volume production contracts with our customers and we do not
control the timing or volume of orders placed by our  customers  whether and to
what extent our customers place orders for any specific products as well as the
mix and quantities of products included in those orders  are factors beyond our
control  insufficient  orders  especially  in our down cycles  will result in
underutilization  of our manufacturing  facilities and  infrastructure and will
negatively affect our operating results and financial condition

international trade and economic conditions

         we serve an  increasingly  global  market  a  majority  of our  annual
revenues  are  derived  from  outside  the  united  states  and we expect  that
international  revenues will  continue to represent a substantial  percentage of
our revenues our international revenues and operations are affected by economic
conditions  specific  to each  country and  region  because of our  significant
dependence on international  revenues  a decline in the economies of any of the
countries  or  regions  in which we do  business  could  negatively  affect  our
operating results

         managing  global  operations  and sites  located  throughout  the world
presents challenges associated with among other things  cultural diversity and
organizational  alignment  moreover  each  region in the global  semiconductor
equipment  market  exhibits  unique   characteristics  that  can  cause  capital
equipment  investment  patterns  to vary  significantly  from  period to period
periodic  local or  international  economic  downturns  trade  balance  issues
political  instability in regions where we have operations  such as israel and
fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our
business  and results of  operations  although  we attempt to manage  nearterm
currency risks through the use of hedging instruments there can be no assurance
that such efforts will be adequate

competition

         our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to
support customers  worldwide  our future performance depends in part upon our
ability to continue to compete successfully  worldwide  some of our competitors
are diversified  companies with greater  financial  resources and more extensive
research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support
capabilities  than we can provide  we face  competition  from  companies  whose
strategy  is to provide a broad array of products  and  services  some of which
compete  with the products and services  that we offer  these  competitors  may
bundle their products in a manner that may discourage  customers from purchasing
our  products   in  addition   we  face   competition  from  smaller  emerging
semiconductor  equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the
products  and  services  which we offer  using  innovative  technology  to sell
page
products into specialized markets loss of competitive position could negatively
impact our prices customer orders  revenues  gross margins and market share
any of which  would  negatively  affect  our  operating  results  and  financial
condition  our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would
seriously harm our business

technological change and customer requirements

         success in the semiconductor  equipment  industry depends  in part on
continual  improvement  of existing  technologies  and rapid  innovation  of new
solutions  for example the semiconductor industry continues to shrink the size
of  semiconductor   devices  which  increasing  wafer  size  and  has  begun  to
commercialize  the  process  of  copperbased  interconnects  these  and  other
evolving  customer  needs  require  us to  respond  with  continued  development
programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs which may no longer have
industrywide support  technical innovations are inherently complex and require
long development cycles and appropriate  professional  staffing our competitive
advantage  and future  business  success  depend on our  ability  to  accurately
predict evolving industry standards to develop and introduce new products which
successfully  address changing customer needs to win market acceptance of these
new   products  and  to   manufacture   these  new  products  in  a  timely  and
costeffective  manner  if we do not develop and  introduce  new  products  and
technologies  in a timely  manner in response to changing  market  conditions or
customer requirements our business could be seriously harmed

         in this environment  we must continue to make significant  investments
in  research  and   development  in  order  to  enhance  the   performance   and
functionality  of our products  to keep pace with  competitive  products and to
satisfy customer demands for improved  performance  features and functionality
there  can be no  assurance  that  revenues  from  future  products  or  product
enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with
such  products or  enhancements  or that we will be able to secure the financial
resources  necessary  to  fund  future  development  substantial  research  and
development  costs  typically  are  incurred  before we  confirm  the  technical
feasibility  and  commercial  viability  of a product  and not all  development
activities result in commercially viable products in addition we cannot ensure
that these products or  enhancements  will receive market  acceptance or that we
will be able to sell these  products  at prices  that are  favorable  to us our
business  will be  seriously  harmed if we are  unable to sell our  products  at
favorable  prices or if our  products are not accepted by the market in which we
operate

key suppliers

         we use a wide range of materials  in the  production  of our  products
including  custom  electronic  and  mechanical  components  and we use numerous
suppliers  to supply  materials  we  generally  do not have  guaranteed  supply
arrangements  with our suppliers  because of the  variability and uniqueness of
customers  orders  we do not maintain an extensive  inventory of materials for
manufacturing   we  seek  to  minimize  the  risk  of  production  and  service
interruptions  andor  shortages  of  key  parts  by  selecting  and  qualifying
alternative  suppliers for key parts  monitoring the financial stability of key
suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make
reasonable  efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple  suppliers
key parts may be  available  only from a single  supplier or a limited  group of
page
suppliersour  business would be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to
meet our production requirements in a timely and costeffective manner

manufacturing disruption

         operations  at our primary  manufacturing  facilities  and our assembly
subcontractors  are subject to  disruption  for a variety of reasons  including
work stoppages terrorism fire earthquake energy shortages flooding or other
natural  disasters  in addition  last year  california  suffered from a severe
energy  shortage  causing  rolling  blackouts  throughout the state  in recent
months  there has also been a marked  increase in  hostility in the middle east
such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers we
cannot ensure that alternate  production  capacity would be available if a major
disruption were to occur or that if it were available  it could be obtained on
favorable  terms  such a disruption  could result in  cancellation of orders or
loss of customers and could seriously harm our business

intellectual property obsolescence and infringement

         our  success  is  dependent  in  part  on  our   technology  and  other
proprietary  rights we own various united states and international  patents and
have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and
technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive
and we cannot be certain  that  pending  or future  applications  will  actually
result in issued patents or that issued  patents will be of sufficient  scope or
strength to provide meaningful  protection or commercial  advantage to us other
companies  and  individuals  including  our  larger  competitors  may  develop
technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around
the patents we own

         we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and
claim copyright  protection for certain proprietary  software and documentation
however  we can give no assurance that our  trademarks  and copyrights  will be
upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties

         while patent  copyright and trademark  protection for our intellectual
property is important  we believe our future success in highly dynamic  markets
is most  dependent  upon the  technical  competence  and creative  skills of our
personnel  we  attempt  to  protect  our trade  secrets  and other  proprietary
information  through  confidentiality  and other  agreements with our customers
suppliers  employees and  consultants and through other security  measures  we
also  maintain  exclusive  and  nonexclusive  licenses  with third  parties for
strategic  technology  used  in  certain  products  however  these  employees
consultants and third parties may breach these  agreements  and we may not have
adequate remedies for wrongdoing  in addition  the laws of certain territories
in which we  develop  manufacture  or sell our  products  may not  protect  our
intellectual  property  rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united
states

         as is typical in the  semiconductor  equipment  industry  from time to
time we have received  communications from other parties asserting the existence
of patent rights  copyrights  trademark rights or other intellectual  property
rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies
or  information  our customary  practice is to evaluate such  assertions and to
consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate  however  we cannot ensure
page
that licenses can be obtained or if obtained  will be on  acceptable  terms or
that costly litigation or other  administrative  proceedings will not occur the
inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could
seriously harm our operating results and financial condition

key employees

         our  employees  are  vital  to our  success  and our  key  management
engineering  and other  employees are difficult to replace  we generally do not
have employment  contracts with our key employees  further  we do not maintain
key  person  life  insurance  on any of our  employees  the  expansion  of high
technology   companies  worldwide  has  increased  demand  and  competition  for
qualified personnel  if we are unable to retain key personnel or if we are not
able to attract  assimilate or retain additional highly qualified  employees to
meet our needs in the future our business and operations could be harmed these
factors could seriously harm our business

acquisitions

         in addition to our efforts to develop new  technologies  from  internal
sources we also seek to acquire new technologies from external sources as part
of this effort  we may make  acquisitions  of or significant  investments  in
businesses  with   complementary   products   services   andor   technologies
acquisitions  involve numerous risks  including  management issues and costs in
connection  with the  integration of the operations and personnel  technologies
and products of the acquired  companies  the possible  writedowns  of impaired
assets and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired  companies  the
inability to manage these risks effectively could seriously harm our business

litigation

         from time to time we are  involved  in  litigation  of  various  types
including litigation that alleges  infringement of intellectual  property rights
and other  claims  litigation  tends to be expensive  and requires  significant
management time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of
operations  or  business  if we lose or have to  settle a case on  significantly
adverse terms if we lose in a dispute concerning intellectual property a court
could require us to pay substantial  damages andor  royalties or could issue an
injunction prohibiting us from using essential technologies for these and other
reasons  this type of litigation  could have a material  adverse  effect on our
business  financial condition and results of operations  also although we may
seek to obtain a license under a third partys  intellectual  property rights in
order to bring an end to certain claims or actions  asserted  against us we may
not be able to obtain such a license on reasonable terms or at all

terrorism and political instability

         the threat of  terrorism  targeted at the regions of the world in which
we do business  including the united states  increases the  uncertainty in our
markets  and may delay any  recovery in the  general  economy  any delay in the
recovery of the economy and the  semiconductor  industry could seriously  impact
our business

         increased international  political instability  as demonstrated by the
september 2001 terrorist  attacks  disruption in air transportation and further
page
enhanced security measures as a result of the september 2001 terrorist  attacks
the conflict in afghanistan  and the increasing  tension in the middle east may
hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of  operations  to
the extent this  instability  continues or otherwise  increases  we could incur
increased costs in transportation make such transportation unreliable increase
insurance costs  and cause  international  currency markets to fluctuate  this
same instability  could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability
to timely deliver their products  if this international  political  instability
continues or increases our business and results of operations could be harmed

effects of recent accounting pronouncements

         in august 2001 the financial  accounting standards board fasb issued
statement no 143 sfas 143  accounting for asset retirement  obligations
which is effective  for fiscal  years  beginning  after june 15 2002  sfas 143
applies to all entities and  addresses  financial  accounting  and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the
associated asset retirement  costs it applies to legal  obligations  associated
with the  retirement  of  longlived  assets that  result from the  acquisition
construction  development  andor the normal operation of a longlived  asset
except for certain obligations of lessees we do not expect the adoption of sfas
143 will have a  significant  impact on our  financial  position  and results of
operations

         in october  2001  the fasb  issued  statement  no  144 sfas  144
accounting  for the  impairment  or disposal of  longlived  assets  sfas 144
addresses  financial  accounting  and reporting for the impairment of longlived
assets and for longlived assets to be disposed  sfas 144 will be effective for
fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 we are currently  evaluating the
impact of sfas 144  but do not expect  that our  adoption  on july 1 2002 will
have a material effect on our financial statements

         in  june  2002  the  fasb  issued  statement  no  146  sfas  146
accounting  for costs  associated with exit or disposal  activities  sfas 146
addresses  financial  accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
disposal  activities  and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no
943  liabilities  recognition for certain  employee  termination  benefits and
other  costs  to  exit  an  activity  including  certain  costs  incurred  in a
restructuring  this statement  requires that a liability for costs  associated
with an exit or disposal  activity be recognized and measured  initially at fair
value only when the  liability is incurred  sfas 146 will be effective for exit
or disposal  activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 the standard
will in certain  circumstances change the timing of recognition of restructuring
costs

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

         we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest
rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to
mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use
derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all of the
potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our
financial position at june 30 2002 actual results may differ materially

         at the end of fiscal  2002  we had an  investment  portfolio  of fixed
income  securities of 883 million  excluding those classified as cash and cash
equivalents  detail of these  securities  is included in note 4 of the notes to
consolidated  financial statements found under item 8 financial statements and
supplementary  data in this annual report on form 10k  these securities  as
with all fixed income  instruments  are subject to interest  rate risk and will
fall in value if market interest rates  increase  if market interest rates were
to increase  immediately  and  uniformly by 10 from levels as of june 30 2002
the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by 6 million

         as of june 30 2002 we had net forward  contracts to sell 115 million
in  foreign  currency  in order to hedge  currency  exposures  detail  of these
contracts  is  incorporated  by  reference  from  note  1 of  the  notes  to the
consolidated  financial  statements under  derivative  instruments  if we had
entered into these contracts on june 30 2002 the us dollar  equivalent would
be 124 million  a 10 adverse move in currency  exchange  rates  affecting the
contracts  would  decrease  the fair  value  of the  contracts  by 15  million
however if this occurred  the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by
the contracts would increase by a similar amount  accordingly  we believe that
the hedging of our foreign  currency  exposure should have no material impact on
income or cash flows

practices

        klatencor corporation was formed in april 1997 through the merger of
kla instruments corporation and tencor instruments two longtime leaders in the
semiconductor equipment industry each with over 20 years of experience kla
instruments corporation was incorporated in delaware in july 1975 and tencor
instruments in california in 1976 effective april 30 1997 tencor instruments
merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of kla instruments corporation
immediately following this merger kla instruments corporation changed its name
to klatencor corporation

industry

general background

        the semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon
wafera round disk that is six eight or twelve inches in diameter about as
thick as a credit card and gray in color the process of manufacturing wafers is
in itself highly sophisticated involving the creation of large ingots of
silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon the ingots are then
sliced into wafers and polished to a mirror finish on one surface upon which
the circuits are made

        the fabrication of an integrated circuit ic or chip is
accomplished by depositing a series of film layers upon a silicon wafer that act
as conductors semiconductors or insulators the deposition of these film layers
is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns
remove portions of the film layers and perform other functions such as heat
treatment measurement and inspection most advanced chip designs require over
300 individual steps many of which are performed multiple times most chips
consist of two main structures the lower structure typically consisting of
transistors or capacitors which performs the smart functions of the chip and
the upper structure typically consisting of interconnect circuitry which
connects the components in the lower structure

current trends

        companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and
refining new technologies and manufacturing processes and bringing them into
production are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market during
previous industry cycles semiconductor manufacturers generally had to contend
with one key new technology or market trend such as a specific design rule
shrink in todays market the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing
in bringing three key new technologies into production at the same time copper
interconnects deepsubwavelength

lithography 013micron design rules and below and 300mm the next larger
wafer size from which more than twice as many ics can be produced as on 200mm
wafers

        while each of these three technologies has been adopted at the
development and pilot production stages several significant challenges and
risks associated with each one have slowed their adoption into fullvolume
production for example as design rules decrease yields become more sensitive
to the size and density of defects while device performance characteristics
become more sensitive to such parameters as linewidth film thickness variation
and other factors copper introduces both new defects that are harder to find
within the interconnect structure as well as electrical defects which cannot
be detected using conventional optical inspection systems 300mm wafers are
more susceptible to damage than 200mm wafers since they can bend or bow twice
as much creating stress on the wafer that can result in yield loss film
uniformity is also more difficult to maintain on these larger wafers moving all
three of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the
risk that chipmakers face since technical challenges in bringing any one of
these into production could also be a factor in slowing the adoption of the
other two

        our key activities during fiscal year 2001 involved the development of
new process control and yield management tools that enable chipmakers to
accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into fullvolume production
while minimizing their associated risks with our portfolio of
applicationsfocused technologies and our dedicated yield consulting expertise
we are in a unique position to be the single source for comprehensive yield
management solutions that enable our customers to achieve firsttomarket
success for their nextgeneration products

        the continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller linewidth
geometries and more complex multilevel circuitry has significantly increased
the cost and the performance requirements of the capital equipment used to
manufacture these devices construction of an advanced wafer fabrication
facility can cost over 2 billion a substantial increase over the cost of
priorgeneration facilities as a result chipmakers are demanding increased
productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment because our
process control and yield management equipment typically represents only a small
percentage of the total investment required to build a fabrication facility our
customers are able to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities
and significantly improve their returns on investment

        accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing the production yields of
highperformance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing
achieving higher yields faster and with higher performance characteristics
increases the revenue a manufacturer can obtain from each semiconductor wafer
klatencor systems are used to analyze product and process quality at all
critical points in the ic manufacturing process and provide feedback to our
customers so that fabrication problems can be identified addressed and
eliminated this ability to locate the source of defects and other process
issues as well as contain them enables semiconductor manufacturers to improve
control over their manufacturing processes as well as increase their yields and
device valuethus maximizing the return on their investments and lowering their
manufacturing costs

        the following are some of the methods used to accelerate yields and
optimize device performance all of which require the capture and analysis of
data gathered through many measurements

               engineering analysis this method of analysis is performed
        offline from the manufacturing process to identify analyze and locate
        the source of defects or other manufacturing process issues engineering
        analysis equipment operates with very high sensitivity to enable
        comprehensive analysis of wafers because this method operates off the
        manufacturing line high operational speeds are not required

               inline monitoring this method of analysis is used to review the
        status of ics during production information generated is used to
        determine whether the fabrication process steps are within required
        tolerances it is also used to make any necessary realtime process
        adjustments before wafer lots move to subsequent process stations
        because information related to defects is needed quickly inline
        monitoring requires both high throughput and high sensitivity

               passfail tests this method of analysis may be used at several
        different points in the manufacturing process to evaluate whether
        products meet performance specifications

the most significant opportunities for yield and device performance improvement
generally occur when production is started at new factories and when chips or
wafers are first built equipment that helps a manufacturer quickly increase new
product yields and optimize device performance enables the manufacturer to offer
these new products in high volumes early in the product life cyclethe time
when they are likely to generate the greatest profits

defect inspection

        our defect inspection tools are used to detect count classify and
characterize particles and pattern defects in offline engineering applications
as well as inline at various stages during the wafer semiconductor and reticle
manufacturing processes we pioneered the market for automated defect inspection
of semiconductor wafers and reticles more than two decades ago our portfolio
includes all the tools necessary for our customers to detect correlate and
analyze defects as well as determine and correct their cause

        highresolution imaging inspection

               in 1997 we introduced the 2138 wafer inspection systema new
        member of our established 21xx series which combines highspeed image
        processing with an ultrabroadband brightfield illumination source and
        our unique segmented auto threshold technology to provide unprecedented
        sensitivity for inspecting patterned wafers in 1999 we introduced the
        model 2139 which extended the capability of the 21xx product line to
        018micron processes and incorporated additional sensitivity and
        easeofuse enhancements in 2000 we introduced the 2350 the first
        ultraviolet uv inspection system to feature ultrabroadband
        brightfield illuminationenabling the resolution of circuit patterns
        and defects for 013micron and smaller processes the 2350 delivers a
        twofold increase in throughput over the previous generation 21xx
        platform

        highspeed laser scattering inspection

               in 1995 we introduced the ait wafer inspection system a
        platform designed with high throughput and low cost of ownership coo
        for fast and accurate feedback on process tool performance as well as
        advanced line monitoring for films cmp and noncritical etch and photo
        modules the ait uses patented doubledarkfield technology which is a
        lowangle illumination technique particularly effective for detecting
        defects on planar surfaces such as postcmp wafers in 1998 we
        introduced the ait ii which expanded on the capabilities of the ait
        through increased sensitivity and throughput in 2000 we introduced the
        ait iii providing the highthroughput inspection needed for 013micron
        and smaller design rules in june 2001 we unveiled the ait xp which
        took our ait inspection family to a whole new level in terms of speed
        and sensitivity performance incorporating our proprietary nextektm
        technology the ait xp can scan an entire wafer in as little as 80
        seconds in a single pass with the sensitivity needed to inspect
        advanced devices incorporating 100nm 010 micron and smaller design
        rules

        ebeam inspection

               scanning electron microscopes sems use an electron beam to
        image and measure surface features on a semiconductor wafer at a much
        higher resolution than images captured by optical microscopes as the
        industry moves deeper into the sub018micron copperdevice realm
        sembased inspection becomes mandatory for accelerating yield

        ramps klatencor pioneered this market with the introduction of the
        industrys first ebeam inspection system more than 8 years ago in
        1999 we unveiled the es20 the first scanning ebeam wafer inspection
        system optimized for use in fullvolume production in 2000 we
        introduced the es20xp which delivers further improvements in
        sensitivity while increasing throughput to enable true production line
        monitoring of sub013micron semiconductor manufacturing klatencor
        leveraged more than 25 years of experience in wafer inspection to bring
        this latest tool to market

        unpatterned wafer inspection

               in 1997 we introduced the surfscan sp1tm for bare wafer
        qualification process monitoring and equipment monitoring applications
        it provides the high sensitivity fast throughput and low coo required
        in a production environment and is used in virtually all semiconductor
        manufacturing processes the sp1tbi triple beam illumination was
        introduced in 1998 and was designed with additional optical
        configurations needed to detect submicron defects on metal films and
        rough surfaces while still providing sensitivity below 100 nm on
        polished silicon the sp1tbi is also used for detecting defects on
        nonuniform films a critical requirement for cmp applications in 1999
        we introduced a surface nanotopography measurement capability for the
        sp1 enhancing lithography and cmp process monitoring for 013micron
        process development in june 2001 we unveiled the sp1dls the first 300
        mm tool to provide brightfield darkfield and nanotopography defect
        information in a single scan it has the sensitivity to capture the
        widest variety of defects as small as 50 nm at high throughput speeds of
        up to 125 wafers per hour

        macro afterdevelop inspection

               in 1999 we became the first to automate afterdevelop inspection
        adi for macro defects with the introduction of the 2401 macro defect
        inspection system designed to replace inefficient manual macro adi the
        2401 is the industrys first fully automated inspection system able to
        detect and classify frontend macro lithographic defects which are 50
        microns and larger in size current manual adi methods may capture only
        20 percent of photorelated defects as a result of wafer complexity
        background patterning noise and human boredom and fatigue in contrast
        the 2401 captures more than 90 percent of all critical macro adi
        defects while providing comprehensive defect classification and yield
        information to dramatically reduce scrap and enable continuous process
        improvements

        reticle inspection

               our reticle inspection systems look for possible defects that
        could be transmitted to the design pattern on the wafer reticles are
        high precision quartz plates that contain microscopic images of
        electronic circuits placed into steppers or scanners these reticles
        are used to transfer circuit patterns onto wafers to fabricate ics
        errorfree reticles are the first step in ensuring high yields in the
        manufacturing process since defects in reticles can be replicated on
        wafers reticle inspection is becoming increasingly critical as the
        industry



                                       8
page   9

        moves to deep subwavelength lithography 013 micron and below where
        the feature sizes printed on wafers are significantly smaller than the
        wavelength of light used in the stepper or scanner this extension of
        the lithography process results in a phenomenon known as the mask error
        enhancement factor where reticle defects once too small to print on
        the wafer become enhanced in the lithography process to create
        yieldkilling wafer defects we pioneered the market for automated
        inspection of reticles and photomasks for the semiconductor
        manufacturing industry over two decades ago and continue to be a market
        leader in addressing our customers evolving inspection requirements

               our 3xx product family incorporates both a reference database
        generator and a data preparation system which add full dietodatabase
        functionality to the inspection this permits inspection against the
        ideal reticle pattern as specified by the users cad program we have
        continued to develop enhancements to the 3xx to improve performance
        serviceability and reliability in 1997 for example we introduced the
        advanced performance algorithm and the starlighttm highresolution
        option these enhancements enable highly accurate and reliable
        inspection of nextgeneration sub025micron reticles including
        reticles with complex optical proximity correction opc geometries in
        1999 we introduced the 365uvhr a deep ultraviolet duv reticle
        pattern inspection tool for both highvolume manufacturing of
        018micron devices and early development of 013micron processes

               in september 2000 we unveiled our new teratm family of reticle
        inspection systems which have the capability to inspect up to a
        terapixel one million by one million pixels per reticle the
        terastartm slf27 a key member of the tera family provides a
        threefold increase in throughput compared to previous generation
        systems and can detect critical killer defects as small as
        100nmmaking it ideal for inspecting advanced multidie reticles used
        in highvolume ic production in july 2001 we unveiled our new
        printability analysis stepper simulatortm pass software tool which
        enables photomask manufacturers to achieve significant time and cost
        savings by automating the reticle defect analysis process and reducing
        the amount of repair work needed for subwavelength photomasks pass is
        compatible with all current klatencor reticle inspection tools

        optical and ebeam defect review

               our defect review capability includes optical confocal
        technology as well as ebeam scanning for higher sensitivity in 1995
        we introduced the crstm optical review system which offers high
        throughput and low coo in 2000 we introduced the ev300 defect review
        systeman advanced automated sem designed to gather and analyze defect
        excursion information as well as report the results with the improved
        sensitivity required at smaller design rules the ev300 supplements
        optical review by providing topographical information enabling more
        accurate defect classification than can be achieved by optical review
        systems alone

process window optimization

        our process window optimization products provide virtually all of the
critical measurements fabs need to manage their advanced manufacturing
processes with our unique combination of cd overlay film thickness and
reflectivity measurements ic manufacturers have the capabilities they need to
maintain the tightest possible control of their lithography etch deposition
and cmp processes

        film measurement

               our film measurement products measure a variety of optical and
        electrical properties of thin films these products are used to control
        a wide range of wafer fabrication steps where withinwafer and
        wafertowafer uniformity of the process is of paramount importance to
        semiconductor manufacturersenabling them to achieve high device
        performance characteristics at the lowest possible cost

               in 1995 we introduced the uv1250se which brought a powerful
        new technology to production called spectroscopic ellipsometry se
        klatencor has shipped more than 500 uvse systems since the
        technology was first introduced our third generation se tool the
        asetf5 addressed the difficult film measurement needs that came from
        the continuing evolution of film development driven by shorter
        linewidths in 1999 we introduced an enhanced version of our
        awardwinning asetf5 thin film measurement system known as the
        asetf5x it incorporates a single wavelength ellipsometry swe
        option to complement the industryleading se and dualbeam
        spectrophotometry dbs technologies incorporated in the asetf5
        these combined capabilities provide the accuracy repeatability and
        systemtosystem matching required for the production of advanced ics
        with geometries as small as 100 nm

        contamination monitoring

               our quantoxr product is a noncontact electrical performance
        metrology system for gate dielectric films gate dielectric quality is
        critical to the speed and reliability of an ic quantox measures key
        parameters such as contamination and oxide thickness which are used
        for gate dielectric process control to help maximize device yield
        klatencor acquired the quantox product line from keithley instruments
        in 1998 since that time it has continued to remain an integral
        component of our portfolio of yield acceleration solutions

        insitu cmp endpoint detection

               in copper deposition metal film thickness and uniformity can
        vary significantly from wafer to wafer to compensate for these
        variances during cmp chipmakers have traditionally had to either take
        copper wafers off line which dramatically slows the production process
        or have used opticalonly insitu metrology methods which provide
        limited information and unreliable endpoint data in march 2001 we
        unveiled precicetm



                                       10
page   11

        the industrys first productionworthy insitu film thickness and
        endpoint control system for copper cmp that provides highlyaccurate
        measurements in real time precice reduces the risk of process errors
        due to nonuniform polishing thereby speeding the ramp of new copper
        processes and maximizing copper yields

        ebeam metrology

               the critical dimension cd of a semiconductor device refers to
        a circuit line element or feature that must be manufactured to tight
        specifications semiconductor circuits can be very sensitive to the
        widths of their features even small variations can affect the speed of
        the circuit or whether the circuit works at all control of linewidth
        errors is critical to the manufacturing process our cd sem metrology
        systems measure selected linewidth features on a chip thus enabling
        control of the manufacturing process

               in 1999 we introduced the 8100xp cd sem designed to address the
        new metrology challenges associated with manufacturing ics with
        018micron and smaller design rules providing maximum flexibility for
        both photomask manufacturers and advanced lithography development fabs
        the 8100xp can measure both reticles and wafers without requiring any
        hardware or software changeover later that year we enhanced our 8100
        cd sem family with our new pattern quality confirmation pqctm
        software with pqc the 8100 cd sem family combines inline realtime
        metrology with process inspection enabling the detection of systematic
        lithography and etch related problems that can go undetected by
        traditional cd sem measurements

               in 2000 we introduced our latestgeneration wafer cd sems the
        8200 series for 200mm wafers and the 8400 series for 300mm wafers
        these tools combine high throughput advanced imaging superior
        measurement precision and enhanced productivity capabilities in a new
        windows ntbased platform we also introduced the 8250r reticle cd
        control system which is based on the 82008400 cd sem platform the
        8250r provides extremely precise and highthroughput measurements on
        advanced reticles used in the production of sub013micron devices

        spectroscopic cd metrology

               new materials that are used in advanced ic production such as
        lowk dielectrics and photoresists for 193nm lithography are difficult
        to control during lithography and etch processes as a result they
        require more comprehensive data to be taken on device features and
        linewidths in order to identify and correct process variations and
        remain within process windows our new spectracdtm system introduced
        in june 2001 provides nondestructive simultaneous and extensive cd
        feature shape and filmthickness measurements from a single tool
        making it one of the industrys lowest costofownership
        productionworthy cd metrology systems for 193nm lithography
        applications and sub100nm device production

        optical overlay

               decreasing linewidths larger die sizes and additional layers
        also affect the tolerances for layertolayer matching overlay
        overlay misregistration errors are a crucial cause of yield loss
        metrology systems are needed to measure the alignment between different
        layers of the semiconductor device our 5000 series overlay metrology
        systems which are more tolerant of process and substrate reflectivity
        variations than other optical systems provide the measurements that our
        customers need to finetune the stepper program to compensate for these
        errors and improve process yield in 1999 we introduced the 5300
        overlay system which provides enhanced performance compared to previous
        generation tools and is designed to handle both 200mm and 300mm
        wafers in february 2001 we unveiled the archer 10 which incorporates
        additional sensitivity throughput and performance enhancements to
        enable highly precise and accurate measurements to within 2nm the
        archer 10 provides one of the industrys most competitive
        costofownership overlay tools for sub013micron and 300mm
        production

        surface metrology

               our stylus profilers measure the surface topography of films and
        etched surfaces and are used in basic research and development as well
        as semiconductor production and quality control in 1999 we introduced
        the hrp240etch the latest generation of our awardwinning hrpr
        high resolution profilers this system combines the dishing and erosion
        measurement capabilities of our longscan profilers with high aspect
        ratio etched feature measurement capability which has historically been
        limited to atomic force microscopes this allows customers to monitor
        their critical etch processes such as shallow trench isolation sti and
        dualdamascene viatrench we also provide stress measurement systems
        and capabilities such as the new wafer bow wafer stress option for our
        asetf5x thin film metrology tool which detect reliabilityrelated
        problems such as film cracking voiding and lifting

        yielddata analysis and management

               in 1999 we acquired taiwanbased acme systems inc a leading
        provider of yield correlation software combining the newlyacquired
        technology from acme with our own yield management expertise led to the
        development of our klarity ace yield analysis software which helps our
        customers quickly identify the source of process problems other
        acquisitions soon followed that continued to enhance our fabwide yield
        management portfolio with our acquisition of finle technologies in
        2000 we developed our klarity prodata lithography modeling and analysis
        software which helps manufacturers reduce their advanced lithography
        development time and cost also in 2000 we acquired fab solutions
        which added advanced process control apc software into our product
        portfolio apc allows our customers to employ techniques that can
        automatically compensate for variances in the ic manufacturing process
        and significantly reduce their yield losses

               in 1997 we introduced impacttm automated defect classification
        adc enabling semiconductor manufacturers to utilize software
        systems both within and between fabrication facilities to accelerate the
        ramp to higher process yields with impact adc semiconductor
        manufacturers can develop a defect classification recipe on one system
        and then export it to any other system or fabrication facility running
        identical processes in 1999 we introduced impact xp incorporating
        improved optics support and a new smartgallerytm setup tool which
        reduces the setup time associated with adc implementation in fabs by as
        much as 70 percent this is a critical requirement particularly for
        foundries and application specific integrated circuit asic
        manufacturers who specialize in short runs of multiple products in
        2000 we introduced impact sem xp bringing to our ev300 sem review tool
        the same productionproven adc capabilities already implemented on our
        highresolution optical wafer inspection platforms with these new
        capabilities customers can optimize the ev300 for use in classifying
        and reviewing the extremely small defects associated with advanced
        semiconductor manufacturing processes including 013micron and smaller
        design rules thus dramatically reducing the coo of sem review

               realtime defect classification capability first introduced on
        both the ait ii and 2139 products continues to be a critical feature on
        all of our nextgeneration optical inspection tools including the ait
        iii and 2350 called iadc i for integrated into the inspection tool
        provides classification and binning of defect types in real time during
        inspection thus providing better organized information in less time and
        at a lower cost

               in june 2001 we introduced our new recipe management service
        called irecipetm which allows factory engineers to quickly and easily
        access existing recipes and associated information that reside on a
        central database from any personal computer that is connected to the fab
        intranet by integrating irecipe into their fab network chipmakers can
        reduce their inspection and metrology tool cost of ownership as well as
        improve their overall fab efficiency

data storage industry

        outside the semiconductor industry klatencor manufactures sells and
services yield management solutions to the data storage market

        in april 2001 the company acquired phase metrics the leading supplier
of inspectioncertification technologies to the data storage industry the
acquisition marks the latest move in the companys plan to leverage its core
competencies and leadership position in the global



                                       14

semiconductor industry to create similar industryleading positions in other
advanced technology markets

        phase metrics tools and technologies complement the worldclass
klatencor systems that already serve as benchmarks for disk and thin film head
metrology whereas klatencors demonstrated technology and expertise focuses on
frontend data storage metrology and inspection phase metrics efforts have
been focused on data storage backend inspection and test by leveraging the
naturally synergistic products and services from both companies in tandem with
their joint sales marketing and customer support channels the newly combined
entity is expected to create the single largest yield management force in the
data storage industry

customers

        to support our growing global customer base we maintain a significant
presence throughout the united states europe asiapacific and japan staffed
with local sales and applications engineers customer and field service
engineers and yield management consultants we count among our largest customers
leading semiconductor manufacturers from each of these regions in fiscal 2001
2000 and 1999 no single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our
revenues

        our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor
manufacturers which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand
for ics and products utilizing ics we do not consider our business to be
seasonal in nature but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment
procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers and is impacted by the
investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets downturns
in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy could have a
material adverse effect on our future business and financial results

sales service and marketing

        our sales service and marketing efforts are focused on building
longterm relationships with our customers we focus on providing a single and
comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield
management products and services customers benefit from the simplified planning
and coordination as well as the increased equipment compatibility found when
dealing with a single supplier our revenues are derived primarily from product
sales principally through our direct sales force and  to a lesser extent 
through distributors

        we believe that the size and location of our field sales service and
applications engineering and marketing organizations represent a competitive
advantage in our served markets we have direct sales forces in the us
europe asiapacific and japan we maintain an export compliance program that is
designed to fully meet the requirements of the us departments of commerce and
state

        we have over 2770 sales and related personnel service engineers and
applications engineers we maintain sales and service offices throughout the
us in addition we conduct sales marketing and services out of whollyowned
subsidiaries or branches of us subsidiaries in a variety of



                                       15

countries including china france germany israel italy japan south korea
malaysia singapore switzerland taiwan thailand and the united kingdom
international sales accounted for approximately 66 70 and 60 of our
revenues in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively additional information
regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years
is incorporated by reference from note 9 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements found under item 8 financial statements and supplementary
data in this annual report on form 10k

        we believe that sales outside the us will continue to be a significant
percentage of our revenues our future performance will depend in part on our
ability to continue to compete successfully in asia one of the largest markets
for the sale of yield management services in process monitoring equipment our
ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable
trading relationships between countries in the region especially japan taiwan
and south korea and the united states and our continuing ability to maintain
satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region

        international sales and operations may be adversely affected by
imposition of governmental controls restrictions on export technology
political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and the
difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations in
addition international sales may be adversely affected by the economic
conditions in each country the revenues from our international business may
also be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates although we attempt
to manage the currency risk inherent in nondollar sales through hedging
there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate these factors
could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial
results

backlog

        our backlog for system shipments totaled 724 million at june 30 2001
compared to 982 million at june 30 2000 we include in our backlog only those
customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment
dates within twelve months we expect to fill the present backlog of orders
during fiscal 2002 however all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by
the customer with limited or no penalty due to possible customer changes in
delivery schedules and to cancellation of orders our backlog at any particular
date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period

research and development

        the market for yield management and process monitoring systems is
characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation these
technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles
and appropriate professional staffing we believe continued and timely
development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary
to maintain our competitive position accordingly we devote a significant
portion of our human and financial resources to research and development
programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain
responsive to their needs as part of our customer



                                       16

relationships we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering
programs whereby our customers offset certain of our research and development
costs

        key activities during fiscal year 2001 involved development of process
control and yield management equipment for smaller feature sizes copperbased
devices and 300mm wafers for information regarding our research and development
expenses during the last three fiscal years including costs offset by our
strategic development and engineering programs see item 7 managements
discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition in
this annual report on form 10k

        in order to make continuing developments in the semiconductor industry
we are committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product
improvement and new product development new product introductions may
contribute to fluctuations in operating results since customers may defer
ordering existing products if new products have reliability or quality
problems those problems may result in reduced orders higher manufacturing
costs delays in acceptance of and payment for new products and additional
service and warranty expenses on occasion we have experienced reliability and
quality problems in connection with certain product introductions resulting in
some of these consequences there can be no assurance that we will successfully
develop and manufacture new hardware and software products or that new hardware
and software products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace if
we do not successfully introduce new products our results of operations will be
affected adversely

manufacturing raw materials and supplies

        we perform system design assembly and testing inhouse and utilize an
outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies
our inhouse manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and
testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through thirdparty
vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products our
principal manufacturing activities take place in san jose and milpitas
california with additional operations in bedford massachusetts san diego
hayward and fremont california and migdal haemek israel we employ
approximately 1300 manufacturing and 1370 engineering personnel

        many of the parts components and subassemblies collectively parts
are standard commercial products although certain items are made to klatencor
specifications we use numerous vendors to supply parts for the manufacture and
support of our products although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that
these parts are available from multiple suppliers this is not always possible
and certain parts included in our systems may be obtained only from a single
supplier or a limited group of suppliers we endeavor to minimize the risk of
production interruption by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for
key parts by monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers and by
ensuring adequate inventories of key parts are available to maintain
manufacturing schedules

        although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source
suppliers in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these
sources could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers and have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and damage customer relationships



                                       17

competition

        the worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is
highly competitive in each of our product markets we face competition from
established and potential competitors some of which may have greater financial
research engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than us such as
applied materials inc and hitachi electronics engineering co ltd we may
also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and
domestic sources we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design
and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new
products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics we
believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial
resources to offer a broad range of products to maintain customer service and
support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process research and
development

        significant competitive factors in the market for process control and
yield management systems include system performance ease of use reliability
installed base and technical service and support we believe that while price
and delivery are important competitive factors the customers overriding
requirement is for systems which easily and effectively incorporate automated
and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing
manufacturing processes thereby enhancing productivity

        our process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor
industry are intended to compete based upon performance and technical
capabilities these systems may compete with less expensive and more
laborintensive manual inspection devices

        management believes that klatencor is a strong competitor with respect
to both its products and services however any loss of competitive position
could negatively impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins
and market share any of which would negatively impact our operating results and
financial condition

acquisitions

        we continue to pursue a course of strategic acquisitions and alliances
to expand our technologies product offerings and distribution capabilities in
fiscal 2001 we acquired substantially all of the assets of phase metrics inc
phase metrics a supplier of inspectioncertification technologies to the
data storage industry

        the financial position and results of operations of this acquisition
were immaterial in relation to those of klatencor and this transaction was
accounted for as a purchase further details of our acquisitions during the last
three fiscal years are incorporated by reference from note 3 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements found under item 8 financial statements and
supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k

        acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues and
costs in connection with integration of the operations technologies and
products of the acquired companies possible writedowns of impaired assets and
the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies



                                       18
page   19

the inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our
operating results and financial condition

patents and other proprietary rights

        we protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of
intellectual property laws including patent copyright and trade secrets we
have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and
intend to continue to pursue the legal protection of our technology through
intellectual property laws in addition from time to time we acquire license
rights under us and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third
parties

        due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield
management systems industry management believes that our protection of patent
and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as
our technological expertise continuing development of new systems market
penetration installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and
service to customers

        no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our
applications that license assignments will be made as anticipated or that our
patents licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to
protect our technology no assurance can be given that any patents issued to or
licensed by us will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the
rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage in
addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our
technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar
or functionally competitive technology

employees

        as of june 30 2001 we employed a total of approximately 6400 persons
none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have experienced no
work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

        competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the
semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry we believe that our future
success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain
qualified management marketing and technical employees

item 3  legal proceedings

        we are named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal
course of our business litigation in general and intellectual property and
securities litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive to normal
business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are
difficult to predict we believe that we have defenses in each of the cases set
forth below and are vigorously contesting each of these matters

ade corporation

        on october 11 2000 ade corporation ade a competitor filed a
patent infringement lawsuit against klatencor in the us district court in
delaware ade claimed damages and sought an injunction under us patent no
6118525 we filed a counterclaim in the same court alleging that ade has
infringed four of our patents we claimed damages and a permanent injunction
against ade in addition we are seeking a declaration from the district court
that ades patent is invalid and not infringed by klatencor while these
matters are in a preliminary stage and we cannot predict the outcome we believe
that we have valid defenses and further believe that our counterclaims have
merit

schlumberger inc and rigg systems inc

        on august 30 1999 we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit in which
schlumberger inc alleges trade secret misappropriation unfair competition and
trade slander on july 21 2000 the court granted our motion for summary
judgment dismissing the case schlumberger inc subsequently filed a motion for
reconsideration of that dismissal and its request for reconsideration was
denied schlumberger has now appealed although the outcome of these claims
cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that this legal matter
will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition even if plaintiff
prevails on january 26 2000 we filed a complaint against philip rigg rigg
systems and schlumberger inc for misappropriation of trade secrets breach of
contract breach of fiduciary duty interference with contract and unfair
competition the defendants filed crosscomplaints on june 5 2000 asserting
various statutory and common law theories although the outcome of these claims
cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that these legal matters
will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations even if the plaintiff prevails

        although we cannot predict the outcome of these claims management does
not believe that any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect
on klatencor were an unfavorable ruling to occur in one or more of the pending
claims there exists the possibility of a material impact on our operating
results for the period in which the ruling occurred

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and
         financial condition

        the following discussion of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and the related notes included in item 8 financial statements and
supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains
forwardlooking statements which involve risk and uncertainties our actual
results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking
statements as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those
discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this report

results of operations

        klatencor corporation is the worlds leading supplier of process
control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related
microelectronics industries our comprehensive portfolio of products software
analysis services and expertise is designed to help integrated circuit
manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire wafer fabrication process 
from research and development to final mass production yield analysis

        in the last half of fiscal 2001 a worldwide softening in demand for
semiconductors resulted in excess capacity and reduced demand for semiconductor
manufacturing equipment consequently we experienced reduced order levels and
some cancellation in orders through the last half of fiscal 2001 resulting in a
lower backlog in fiscal q1 2002 we expect orders to be flat to down 10 as
compared to the prior quarter

        despite the market fluctuations our financial position has remained
strong and we continue to have no longterm debt in response to the downturn in
the semiconductor industry we have implemented initiatives to reduce costs and
control spending however we have increased our new product development by
investing in leading edge technologies and by strategic acquisitions and
alliances these investments should position our extensive product line to
address the critical initiatives that are key to our customers

        in december 1999 the staff of the securities and exchange commission
sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 101 revenue recognition in
financial statements the sec staff addressed several issues in sab 101
including the timing of revenue recognition for sales that involve contractual
customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product if these events
occur after shipment and transfer of title historically we recognized system
revenue when the product was shipped risk of loss had passed to the customer
and collection of the resulting receivable was probable under the new
accounting method adopted retroactive to july 1 2000 we changed our method of
accounting for system sales to generally recognize revenue upon a positive
affirmation by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating
according to predetermined specifications in the fourth fiscal quarter of
2001 we implemented the provisions of sab 101 retroactive to the beginning of
fiscal 2001 this was reported as a cumulative effect of a



                                       24
page   25

change in accounting principle as of july 1 2000 the results for the first
three quarters of fiscal year ended june 30 2001 have been restated in
accordance with sab 101 this change resulted in a cumulative deferred revenue
of 6609 million as of june 30 2000 which translated into a net noncash
charges of 3064 million after reduction for income taxes of 1475 million
or a charge of 159 per share pro forma amounts for the periods beginning
before july 1 2000 have not been presented as the effect of the change in
accounting principle could not be reasonably determined

        sab 101 adds an additional cycle time between order acceptance booking
and revenue our goal is to minimize the impact of cycle time but our systems
are complex instruments and can require lengthy installation and integration in
the fab therefore we expect that sab 101 will result in a slower revenue ramp
when bookings are accelerating and a slower revenue decline when bookings are
decelerating

revenues and gross margin

        in fiscal 2001 revenues increased 605 million or 40 to a record
210 billion from 150 billion in fiscal 2000 revenues of 210 billion in
fiscal 2001 reflect klatencors adoption of sab 101 in fiscal 2000 revenues
increased 656 million or 78 to 150 billion from 843 million in fiscal
1999 we experienced revenue increases for two consecutive years across nearly
all product lines as a result of the increased capital spending by major
semiconductor manufacturers for additional capacity and new technology in
fiscal 2001 international revenues decreased to 66 of revenues from 70 in
fiscal 2000 due to lower demand in japan and taiwan partially offset by higher
demand in western europe and asia pacific in fiscal 2000 international
revenues increased to 70 of revenues from 60 due to higher demand in taiwan
asia pacific japan and western europe

        gross margins as a percentage of revenues were 55 55 and 47 in
fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the gross margin ratio in fiscal 2001
remained flat year to year the increase in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999
was due primarily to increased capacity utilization resulting from higher unit
volume as well as faster growth of highermargin product revenue

engineering research and development

        net engineering research and development expenses were 356 million
246 million and 165 million or 17 16 and 20 of revenues in fiscal 2001
2000 and 1999 respectively the dollar increase in fiscal 2001 compared to
fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily
attributable to increased investment in new technologies associated with our
ongoing efforts to develop products which address new market segments
enhancements to existing products including nextgeneration 300mm products and
inspection enhancements for subquarter micron technology

        net engineering research and development expenses were partially offset
by 8 million 16 million and 14 million in external funding received under
certain strategic development programs conducted with several of our customers
in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively



                                       25
page   26

        our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to
produce products and services that have a competitive advantage in our
marketplace to do this we believe that we must continue to make substantial
investments in our research and development efforts we remain committed to
product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the
requirements of 018 micron and 013 micron feature sizes realtime review and
the transition to copper technology our investments in new technology and
existing product enhancements are intended to enable our customers to achieve
higher productivity through costeffective leading edge technology solutions

selling general and administrative

        selling general and administrative expenses were 354 million 268
million and 199 million or 17 18 and 24 of revenues in fiscal 2001 2000
and 1999 respectively the increase in dollars in fiscal 2001 as compared to
fiscal 2000 was primarily due to increased costs associated with the growth in
revenues the increase in dollars in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999
was primarily due to increases in our selling and marketing infrastructure and
commissions paid

nonrecurring acquisition restructuring and other charges

        nonrecurring acquisition restructuring and other charges credits
were 2 million 5 million and 43 million in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively these charges credits are directly attributable to nonrecurring
acquisition charges incurred as we continue to pursue a course of strategic
acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies product offerings and
distribution capabilities and to restructuring charges incurred in connection
with our fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2001 restructure plans that are offset by
nonrecurring income in fiscal 2001

nonrecurring acquisition charges for the year ended june 30 2001

        in april 2001 we purchased substantially all of the assets of phase
metrics inc phase metrics a privately held company for a total of
approximately 189 million in cash including approximately 13 million in
acquisition costs phase metrics is a supplier of inspectioncertification
technologies to the data storage industry the total purchase price was
allocated to the net tangible assets of 131 million identifiable intangible
assets of 49 million inprocess research and development of 07 million on
the basis of their relative fair values with the excess of 02 million to
goodwill

        inprocess research and development represented the value of products
that were not considered to have reached technological feasibility to determine
the value of the inprocess technology of the fiscal 2001 acquisition the
expected future cash flows attributable to the inprocess technology were
discounted at 30 taking into account the percentage of completion utilization
of preexisting technology risks related to the characteristics and
applications of the technology existing and future markets and technological
risk associated with completing the development of the technology the valuation
approach used was a form of discounted cash flow



                                       26
page   27

approach commonly known as the percentage of completion approach whereby the
cash flows from the technology are multiplied by the percentage of completion of
the inprocess technology

nonrecurring acquisition charges for the year ended june 30 2000

        in march 2000 we purchased the assets and related technology of fab
solutions a division of objectspace inc for an aggregate purchase price of 8
million fab solutions is a leading provider of advanced process control
software solutions used to respond to yieldimpacting parametric data in
nearreal time we recorded a charge of 08 million for purchased inprocess
research and development representing the appraised value of products that were
not considered to have reached technological feasibility

        in february 2000 we acquired software developer finle technologies
inc a supplier of lithography modeling and data analysis software used to
speed development of advanced lithography processes required to develop and
produce integrated circuits with 012 micron and smaller geometries for an
aggregate purchase price of 5 million we recorded a charge of 05 million for
purchased inprocess research and development representing the appraised value
of products that were not considered to have reached technological feasibility

        in november 1999 we acquired software developer acme systems inc a
leading supplier of yield engineering analysis software used to correlate
parametric electrical test and wafer sort yield data with inline work in
process and metrology data for an aggregate purchase price of 69 million we
recorded a charge of 19 million for purchased inprocess research and
development representing the appraised value of products that were not
considered to have reached technological feasibility

        to determine the value of the inprocess technology of the fiscal 2000
acquisitions the expected future cash flow attributable to the inprocess
technology was discounted taking into account the percentage of completion
utilization of preexisting technology risks related to the characteristics and
applications of the technology existing and future markets and technological
risk associated with completing the development of the technology the valuation
approach used was a form of discounted cash flow approach commonly known as the
percentage of completion approach whereby the cash flows from the technology
are multiplied by the percentage of completion of the inprocess technology in
each acquisition the value of tangible net assets acquired was nominal

nonrecurring acquisition charges for the year ended june 30 1999

        in december 1998 we purchased assets and related technology from
uniphase corporation for an aggregate purchase price of 3 million the confocal
laser review station technology acquired is currently used for analysis of
defects on silicon wafers assets acquired of 3 million consisted primarily of
inventory

        in november 1998 we purchased assets and technology from keithley
instruments inc for an aggregate purchase price of 10 million the corona
wire gate oxide monitoring tool technology



                                       27
page   28

we acquired had not yet reached the alpha stage and the cost to complete the
development of this equipment was estimated at the time of acquisition to be 1
million we recorded a charge of 8 million for purchased inprocess research
and development representing the appraised value of products that were not
considered to have reached technological feasibility

         in june 1998 we acquired groff associates inc dba vars inc for an
aggregate purchase price of 13 million the digital and inlinemonitoring
image archiving retrieval software technology we acquired had not yet reached
the alpha stage and the cost to complete the development of these software
products was estimated at the time of acquisition to be 2 million we recorded
a charge of 13 million for purchased inprocess research and development
representing the appraised value of products that were not considered to have
reached technological feasibility

        in may 1998 we acquired deviceware inc a company in its development
stage for an aggregate purchase price of 3 million the bit mapping defect
characterization technology acquired had not yet reached the alpha stage and the
cost to complete the development of this software product was estimated at the
time of acquisition to be 1 million we recorded a charge of 3 million for
purchased inprocess research and development representing the appraised value
of product that was not considered to have reached technological feasibility

        for each of the above three fiscal 1999 transactions the appraised
value under the income approach used for our calculation did not differ
materially from the result under the percentage of completion approach preferred
by the securities and exchange commission the value of the tangible net assets
acquired was nominal

        each of the above acquisitions was accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting and the developmental products acquired were evaluated in
the context of interpretation 4 of sfas 2 and sfas 86 the allocation of the
purchase price to inprocess research and development cost was determined by
identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had
not been established and no alternative future uses existed substantially all
of the inprocess research and development projects acquired were expected to be
complete and generating revenues within the 24 months following the acquisition
date

        development of acquired technologies remains a significant risk due to
the remaining effort required to achieve technical feasibility rapidly changing
customer markets and significant competitive threats from numerous companies
failure to bring any of these products to market in a timely manner could
adversely affect our sales and profitability in the future additionally the
value of net assets and other intangible assets acquired may become impaired

restructuring and other charges credits

        during fiscal 2001 in response to the downturn in the semiconductor
industry we implemented a restructuring plan to control spending our
restructuring plan included three main categories facilities of 47 million
severance and benefits of 16 million and other costs of 10 million due to
our downsizing and consolidation of certain of our operations we will vacate
two of



                                       28
page   29

our leased office buildings and have included the remaining net book value of
the related leasehold improvements as well as the future lease payments net of
anticipated sublease revenue in the charge we have reduced our workforce by
approximately 5 primarily in the manufacturing areas and recorded severance
charges related to these terminations in addition during the fourth fiscal
quarter of 2001 klatencor sold software and intellectual property associated
with its isupporttm online customer support technology and recorded 100
million pretax nonrecurring income which was netted with the other
nonrecurring charges

        during fiscal 1999 we implemented a restructuring plan to address the
impact on our business of the downturn in the semiconductor industry estimated
restructuring costs of 35 million were classified in four main categories
facilities inventory severance and benefits and other restructuring costs
facilities costs of 12 million included 8 million for lease expense resulting
from consolidation and closure of certain offices located primarily in the
united states and japan 3 million for leasehold improvements impaired in those
facilities and 1 million in other facilitiesrelated exit costs
inventoryrelated costs of 10 million resulted from impaired assets related to
unique parts and noncancelable purchase commitments of certain development
programs which were terminated as part of the realignment and streamlining of
our product lines severance and benefitrelated costs of 8 million included
involuntary termination of approximately 250 personnel from manufacturing
engineering sales marketing and administration throughout the united states
japan and europe other restructuring costs of 5 million related primarily to
the writeoff of software licenses and related noncancelable maintenance
contracts for closed locations during fiscal year 2000 klatencor management
determined that 78 million of the restructure reserve would not be utilized
because of a change in managements plans for utilization of certain facilities
resulting from an increase in demand for the companys products accordingly
the restructuring reserve reversal was included in the determination of income
from operations for the year ended june 30 2000

interest income and other net

        interest income and other net was 54 million 42 million and 61
million in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively interest income and other
net is comprised primarily of gains realized on sales of marketable securities
interest income earned on the investment and cash portfolio and income
recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts the increase
in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily due to increased
interest income resulting from higher interest rate and higher average
investment balances the decrease in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 was
primarily due to 17 million in gains realized on the sale of equity securities
held in former supplier company in fiscal 1999

provision for income taxes

        klatencors effective income tax rate was 27 28 and 22 in fiscal
2001 2000 and 1999 respectively in general our effective income tax rate
differs from the statutory rate of 35 largely as a function of benefits
realized from our foreign sales corporation research and development tax
credits income derived from tax exempt interest and foreign taxes during
fiscal



                                       29
page   30

1999 income related to tax exempt interest increased as a component of total
net income in addition to the impact of restructuring which resulted in a
significantly lower effective tax rate as compared to fiscal 2000 and 2001

        our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors such as
tax legislation the geographic composition of our pretax income nontax
deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions amounts of
taxexempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage
of aggregate pretax income and the effectiveness of our tax planning
strategies

liquidity and capital resources

        working capital was 913 million as of june 30 2001 compared to 106
billion as of june 30 2000 cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable
securities increased to 697 million from 598 million at june 30 2000 in
addition we maintained 450 million and 366 million in marketable securities
classified as longterm as of june 30 2001 and 2000 respectively

        cash provided by operating activities was 408 million 253 million
and 122 million in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the increase in
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was
primarily due to increased income before cumulative effect of accounting change
lower accounts receivable and increased other current liabilities partially
offset by increased inventory decreased deferred profit and deferred income
taxes the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2000
compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily due to the increase in net income and
other current liabilities offset by increased levels of accounts receivable
inventories and deferred taxes

        cash used in investing activities was 295 million 96 million and 38
million in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively investing activities
typically consist of purchases and sales or maturity of marketable securities
purchases of capital assets to support longterm growth and acquisitions of
technology or other companies to allow access to new market segments or emerging
technologies

        we used 58 million of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2001
generated 61 million in fiscal 2000 and used 16 million in fiscal 1999
financing activities typically include sales and repurchases of our common
stock as well as borrowings and repayments of debt issuance of common stock
net of repurchases used 60 million in fiscal 2001 provided 79 million in
fiscal 2000 and used 7 million in fiscal 1999

        during fiscal 2001 and 2000 we sold trade notes and accounts receivable
from japanese customers at june 30 2001 and 2000 524 million and 519
million respectively of these receivables were outstanding

        during fiscal 1998 we entered into certain lease arrangements in
milpitas and san jose california in connection with these agreements we have
a contingent liability to the lessor for 100 million in residual value
guarantees of the properties under lease the impact of these agreements is not
expected to be material to our liquidity



                                       30
page   31

        we have adopted a plan for the systematic repurchase of shares of our
common stock in the open market to reduce the dilution created by our
stockbased employee benefit and incentive plans in fiscal 2001 we repurchased
4580000 shares of our common stock at an average price of 3354 per share
for a total cash outlay of 154 million in fiscal 2000 we repurchased 520000
shares of our common stock at an average price of 5380 per share for a total
cash outlay of 28 million in fiscal 1999 we repurchased 2152000 shares of
our common stock at an average price of 2266 per share for a total cash
outlay of 49 million since the inception of the repurchase program in 1997
through june 30 2001 we have repurchased a total of 8008000 shares at an
average price of 3077 per share all such shares remain as treasury shares

        at june 30 2001 our principle sources of liquidity consisted of 115
billion of cash cash equivalents and investments

        our liquidity is affected by many factors some of which are based on
the normal ongoing operations of the business and others of which relate to the
uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor
equipment industries although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the
timing and extent of these factors our management believes that cash generated
from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances
will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months

factors affecting results including risks and uncertainties

fluctuations in operating results and stock price

        our operating results have varied widely in the past and our future
operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon
a wide variety of factors including those listed in this section and throughout
this annual report on form 10k in addition future operating results may not
follow any past trends we believe the factors that make our results fluctuate
and difficult to predict include

        o  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry

        o  the reduction in the price and the profitability of our products

        o  our timing of new product introductions

        o  our ability to develop and implement new technologies

        o  the change in customers schedules for fulfillment of orders

        o  the cancellation of contracts by major customers

        o  the shortage of qualified workers in the areas we operate and

        o  our ability to manage our manufacturing requirements



                                       31
page   32

        operating results also could be affected by sudden changes in customer
requirements currency exchange rate fluctuations and other economic conditions
affecting customer demand and the cost of operations in one or more of the
global markets in which we do business as a result of these or other factors
we could fail to achieve our expectations as to future revenues gross profit
and income from operations our failure to meet the performance expectations set
and published by external sources could result in a sudden and significant drop
in the price of our stock particularly on a shortterm basis and could
negatively affect the value of any investment in our stock

semiconductor equipment industry volatility

        the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical the purchasing
decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the
local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry
worldwide the timing length and severity of the upanddown cycles in the
semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict this cyclical nature
of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict
future revenues and thus future expense levels when cyclical fluctuations
result in lower than expected revenue levels operating results may be adversely
affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain
competitive and financially sound during a down cycle we must be in a position
to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to
continue to motivate and retain our key employees in addition during periods
of rapid growth we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and
personnel to meet customer demand we can provide no assurance that these
objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles if we
fail to respond to industry cycles our business could be seriously harmed

        currently we are in an industry down cycle during a down cycle the
semiconductor industry typically experiences excess production capacity that
causes semiconductor manufacturers to decrease capital spending we generally do
not have longterm volume production contracts with our customers and we do not
control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers whether and to
what extent our customers place orders for any specific products as well as the
mix and quantities of products included in those orders are factors beyond our
control insufficient orders especially in our down cycles will result in
underutilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure and will
negatively affect our operating results and financial condition

international trade and economic conditions

        ours is an increasingly global market a majority of our revenues are
derived from outside the united states and we expect that international
revenues will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenues
our international revenues and operations are affected by economic conditions
specific to each country and region because of our significant dependence on
international revenues a decline in the economies of any of the countries or
regions in which we do business could negatively affect our operating results

        managing global operations and sites located throughout the world
presents challenges associated with among other things cultural diversity and
organizational alignment moreover each region in the global semiconductor
equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can



                                       32
page   33

cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to
period periodic local or international economic downturns trade balance
issues political instability and fluctuations in interest and currency exchange
rates could negatively affect our business and results of operations although
we attempt to manage nearterm currency risks through the use of hedging
instruments there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate

competition

        our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to
support customers worldwide our future performance depends in part upon our
ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide some of our competitors
are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive
research engineering manufacturing marketing and customer service and support
capabilities than we can provide we face competition from companies whose
strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services some of which
compete with the products and services that we offer these competitors may
bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing
our products in addition we face competition from smaller emerging
semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the
products and services which we offer using innovative technology to sell
products into specialized markets loss of competitive position could negatively
impact our prices customer orders revenues gross margins and market share
any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial
condition our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would
seriously harm our business

technological change and customer requirements

        success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends in part on
continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new
solutions for example the semiconductor industry continues to shrink the size
of semiconductor devices and has begun to commercialize the process of
copperbased interconnects these and other evolving customer needs require us
to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue
older programs which may no longer have industrywide support technical
innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and
appropriate professional staffing our competitive advantage and future business
success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards
to develop and introduce new products which successfully address changing
customer needs to win market acceptance of these new products and to
manufacture these new products in a timely and costeffective manner if we do
not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in
response to changing market conditions or customer requirements our business
could be seriously harmed

        in this environment we must continue to make significant investments in
research and development in order to enhance the performance and functionality
of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer
demands for improved performance features and functionality there can be no
assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be
sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or



                                       33
page   34

enhancements or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary
to fund future development substantial research and development costs typically
are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial
viability of a product and not all development activities result in
commercially viable products in addition we cannot ensure that these products
or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell
these products at prices that are favorable to us our business will be
seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if
our products are not accepted by the market in which we operate

key suppliers

        we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products
including custom electronic and mechanical components and we use numerous
suppliers to supply materials we generally do not have guaranteed supply
arrangements with our suppliers because of the variability and uniqueness of
customers orders we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for
manufacturing we seek to minimize the risk of production and service
interruptions andor shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying
alternative suppliers for key parts monitoring the financial stability of key
suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make
reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers
key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of
suppliers there can be no assurance that our business will not be harmed if we
do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely
and costeffective manner

        operations at our primary manufacturing facilities and our assembly
subcontractors are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including
work stoppages fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters such
disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers we
cannot ensure that alternate production capacity would be available if a major
disruption were to occur or that if it were available it could be obtained on
favorable terms such a disruption could result in cancellation of orders or
loss of customers and could seriously harm our business

intellectual property obsolescence and infringement

        our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary
rights we own various united states and international patents and have
additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and
technologies the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive
and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually
result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or
strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us other
companies and individuals including our larger competitors may develop
technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around
the patents we own

        we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and
claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation
however we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be
upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties



                                       34
page   35

        while patent copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual
property is important we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets
is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our
personnel we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary
information through agreements with our customers suppliers employees and
consultants and through other security measures we also rely on trade secret
protection for our technology in part through confidentiality agreements with
our employees consultants and third parties we also maintain exclusive and
nonexclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in
certain products however these employees consultants and third parties may
breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing
in addition the laws of certain territories in which we develop manufacture or
sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same
extent as do the laws of the united states

        as is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry from time to time
we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of
patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other intellectual property
rights which they believe cover certain of our products processes technologies
or information our customary practice is to evaluate such assertions and to
consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate however we cannot ensure
that licenses can be obtained or if obtained will be on acceptable terms or
that litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur the
inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could
seriously harm our operating results and financial condition

key employees

        our employees are vital to our success and our key management
engineering and other employees are difficult to replace we generally do not
have employment contracts with our key employees further we do not maintain
key person life insurance on any of our employees the expansion of high
technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for
qualified personnel we may not be able to attract assimilate or retain
additional highly qualified employees in the future these factors could
seriously harm our business

acquisitions

        we seek to develop new technologies from both internal and external
sources as part of this effort we may make acquisitions of or significant
investments in businesses with complementary products services andor
technologies acquisitions involve numerous risks including management issues
and costs in connection with the integration of the operations and personnel
technologies and products of the acquired companies the possible writedowns of
impaired assets and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired
companies the inability to manage these risks effectively could seriously harm
our business

litigation

        from time to time we are involved in litigation of various types
including litigation that alleges infringement of intellectual property rights
and other claims litigation tends to be expensive and requires significant
management time and attention if we lose in a dispute concerning



                                       35
page   36

intellectual property a court could require us to pay substantial damages
andor royalties or could issue an injunction prohibiting us from using
essential technologies for these and other reasons this type of litigation
could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and
results of operations also although we may seek to obtain a license under a
third partys intellectual property rights in order to bring an end to certain
claims or actions asserted against us we may not be able to obtain such a
license on reasonable terms or at all

regional electric shortages

        recently california has been experiencing a shortage of electric power
supply that has resulted in intermittent loss of power in some areas in the form
of rolling blackouts while we have not experienced any power failures to date
a blackout may affect our ability to manufacture products and meet scheduled
deliveries if blackouts were to interrupt our power supply we would be
temporarily unable to continue operations at some of our facilities any such
interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could
damage our reputation harm our ability to retain existing customers and to
obtain new customers and could result in lost revenue any of which could
substantially harm our business and results of operations

euro conversion

        a new european currency was implemented commencing in january 1999 to
replace the separate currencies of eleven western european countries this
requires changes in our operations as we modify systems and commercial
arrangements to deal with the new currency modifications are necessary in
operations such as payroll benefits and pension systems contracts with
suppliers and customers and internal financial reporting systems during the
threeyear transition period in which transactions may also be made in the old
currencies we must maintain dual currency processes for our operations we have
identified the issues created by this problem and the cost of this effort is
not expected to have a material effect on our business or results of operations
we cannot be certain however that all problems will be foreseen and corrected
or that no material disruption of our business will occur as a result of this
currency change

effects of recent accounting pronouncements

        in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
fasb statements nos 141 and 142 sfas 141 and sfas 142 business
combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets respectively sfas 141
replaces apb 16 and eliminates poolingofinterests accounting prospectively it
also provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of
intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill sfas 142 changes the
accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairmentonly
approach under sfas 142 goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events
or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired sfas 141 and
sfas 142 are required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after december
15 2001 but must be applied to all business combinations completed after june
30 2001 upon adoption of sfas 142 amortization of goodwill recorded for
business combinations consummated prior to july 1 2001 will cease and
intangible assets acquired prior to july 1 2001 that do not meet the criteria
for recognition under sfas 141 will be reclassified to goodwill



                                       36
page   37

companies are required to adopt sfas 142 for fiscal years beginning after
december 15 2001 but early adoption is permitted in connection with the
adoption of sfas 142 we will be required to perform a transitional goodwill
impairment assessment we are currently studying these standards and have not
yet determined what impact they will have on our results of operations and
financial position

        in august 2001 the fasb issued statement no 143 sfas 143
accounting for asset retirement obligations which is effective for fiscal
years beginning after june 15 2002 sfas 143 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived
assets and the associated asset retirement costs the statement applies to all
entities it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of
longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development
and or the normal operation of a longlived asset except for certain
obligations of lessees we do not expect the adoption of sfas 143 will have a
significant impact on our financial position and results of operations




item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

        we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest
rates foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices to
mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use
derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes all of the
potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our
financial position at june 30 2001 actual results may differ materially

        at the end of fiscal 2001 we had an investment portfolio of fixed
income securities of 575 million excluding those classified as cash and cash
equivalents detail of these securities is incorporated by reference from note 4
of the notes to consolidated financial statements found under item 8 financial
statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k these
securities as with all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate
risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase if market
interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 from levels as
of june 30 2001 the fair value of the portfolio would decline by 5 million

        as of june 30 2001 we had net forward contracts to sell 159 million in
foreign currency in order to hedge currency exposures detail of these contracts
is incorporated by reference from note 1 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements found under item 8 financial statements and supplementary
data in this annual report on form 10k if we had entered into these
contracts on june 30 2001 the us dollar equivalent would be 151 million
the fair market value we would have received if we had sold the contracts on
june 30 2001 would have been 8 million a 10 adverse move in currency
exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the
contracts by 19 million however if this occurred the fair value of the
underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount
accordingly we believe that the hedging of our foreign currency exposure should
have no material impact to income or cash flows
