distribution 

bd’s products are marketed and distributed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels as well as directly to hospitals and other healthcare related institutions by bd and independent sales representatives bd uses acute care nonacute care laboratory and drug wholesaler distributors to broadly support our overall disposable product demand from our end user customers in the united states while our capital equipment is mostly sold direct to our end user customers in international markets products are distributed either directly or through distributors with the practice varying by country order backlog is not usually material to bd’s business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis bd’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the medication delivery solutions business unit and flu diagnostic products in the integrated diagnostic systems business unit both of which relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza in order to service its customers optimize logistics lower facilities costs and reduce finished goods inventory levels bd operates consolidated distribution facilities globally 

raw materials and components 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials and components including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products bd seeks to ensure continuity of supply by securing multiple options for sourcing however there are situations where raw materials and components are only available from one supplier which are referred to as sole sourced the use of sole sourced materials and components may be due to sourcing of proprietary andor patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product in other cases while a raw material or component can be sourced from multiple manufacturers only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance cost or other considerations in order to provide alternate sources bd must complete a rigorous qualification process which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval if clinical trials are not required this qualification process can take 318 months depending on the criticality of the change when clinical trials are required this process may lengthen the qualification phase from one to three years bd continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and components and maintains business continuity plans with its suppliers bd’s continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities maintaining contingency stock internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts while bd works closely with its suppliers no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful and there may be events that cause supply interruption reduction or termination that adversely impacts bd’s ability to manufacture and sell certain products see further discussion of the risks related to the supply chain and raw materials in item 1a risk factors

intellectual property and licenses 

bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bd’s business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bd’s business as a whole or to any business segment 

competition 

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics nontraditional point of care and athome testing safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment in addition the entry into the market of lowcost manufacturers has created increased pricing pressures bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates bd continues to make investments in rd quality management quality improvement product innovation manufacturing and supply chain investments to boost supply reliability and productivity improvement in support of its core strategies see further discussion of the risks relating to competition in the medical technology industry in item 1a risk factors 

thirdparty reimbursement 

reimbursement is an important strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical technology obtaining coverage coding and payment is critical to the commercial success of a new product or procedure difficulty in achieving market access can lead to slow adoption in the marketplace and inadequate payment levels that can continue for months or even years 

a majority of bd’s customers rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures products and services they provide vertical integration has created a very concentrated market among commercial thirdparty payers in the us global payers are increasingly focused on strategies to control spending on healthcare and reward improvements in quality and patient outcomes 

bd is actively engaged in identifying and communicating value propositions of its products for payer provider and patient stakeholders and it employs various efforts and resources to attempt to positively impact coverage coding and payment pathways however bd has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and payment levels for bd products the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer’s discretion as bd’s product offerings are diverse across a variety of healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment pathways that impact the decisions of healthcare providers regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products therefore changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products in any given country for any given product 

as government programs expand healthcare coverage for their citizens they have at the same time sought to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures products or services in addition most payers are seeking price predictability in order to mitigate future exposure to manufacturer price increases this is coupled with an increase in high deductible private insurance plans which transfer more pricing exposure and burden directly to the patient 

many payers both in the us and globally have developed specific payment and delivery mechanisms to support these cost control efforts and to focus on paying for value these mechanisms include payment reductions pay for performance measures qualitybased performance payments restrictive coverage policies bidding and tender mechanics studies to compare the effectiveness of therapies and use of technology 

assessments these changes whether the result of legislation new strategic alliances or market consolidations have created an increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective and qualitydriven healthcare 

for example as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” the us has implemented valuebased payment methodologies and has created alternative payment models such as bundled payments to continue to drive improved value we see other governments around the world considering similar bundling reform measures with the utilization of the diagnosis related gro up “drg” as a payment mechanism to drive toward quality and resourcebased reimbursement becoming more common in regions outside the us 

regulation 

general 

bds operations are global and are affected by complex state federal and international laws relating to healthcare environmental protection occupational health and safety antitrust anticorruption marketing fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws export control product safety and efficacy employment privacy and other areas 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

bd actively maintains quality systems that establish standards for its product design manufacturing and distribution processes in accordance with iso standards and fda regulation prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure authorization from the fda and counterpart foreign regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of bd’s quality systems as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials these regulatory controls as well as any changes in agency policies can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new and existing products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes these agencies have the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions for violations of applicable requirements bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

bd also is subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the united states concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws global anticorruption transportation safety and health and customs and exports many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years this is part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the united states 

in addition the federal government has enacted the sunshine act provisions requiring bd to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals countries outside the united states have enacted similar local laws requiring medical device companies to report transfers of value to healthcare providers licensed in those countries failure to comply with these laws could result in a range of fines penalties andor other sanctions 

consent decree with fda 

our infusion pump organizational unit is operating under an amended consent decree entered into by carefusion with the fda in 2007 carefusion’s consent decree with the fda is related to its alaris™ se infusion pumps in february 2009 carefusion and the fda amended the consent decree the “consent decree” to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for carefusion 303 inc the organizational unit that manufactures and sells bd alaris™ infusion pumps in the united states the consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories 

following an inspection that began in march 2020 of our medication management systems facility carefusion 303 inc in san diego california the fda issued to bd a form 483 notice the “form 483 notice” that contains a number of observations of nonconformance with the fda’s quality system regulations in december 2021 the fda issued to carefusion 303 inc a letter of noncompliance with respect to the consent decree the “noncompliance letter” stating that among other things it had determined that certain of bd’s corrective actions with respect to the form 483 notice appeared to be adequate some were still in progress such that adequacy could not be determined yet and certain others were not adequate eg complaint handling and corrective and preventive actions “capa” design verification and medical device reporting per the terms of the noncompliance letter carefusion 303 inc provided the fda with a proposed comprehensive corrective action plan and has retained an independent expert to conduct periodic audits of the carefusion 303 inc infusion pump facilities over the next four years carefusion 303 inc will update its corrective action plan to address any observations that may arise during the course of these audits the fda’s review of the items raised in the form 483 notice and noncompliance letter remains ongoing and no assurances can be given regarding further action by the fda as a result of the observations including but not limited to action pursuant to the consent decree or that corrective actions proposed by carefusion 303 inc will be adequate to address these observations additionally we cannot currently predict the amount of additional monetary investment that will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matter’s ultimate impact on our business 

the consent decree authorizes the fda in the event of any violations in the future to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing infusion pumps recall products and take other actions we may be required to pay damages of 15000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the consent decree up to 15 million per year 

we may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because among other things the fda may determine that we are not fully compliant with the consent decree and noncompliance letter and therefore impose penalties under the consent decree andor we may also be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the consent decree including but not limited to additional fines penalties other monetary remedies and expansion of the terms of the consent decree as of september 30 2022 we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the consent decree and accordingly we have no accruals associated with compliance with the consent decree 

we are undertaking certain remediation of our bd alaris™ system and are currently shipping the product in the us only in cases of medical necessity and to remediate recalled software versions as previously disclosed we submitted our 510k premarket notification to the fda for the bd alaris™ system in april 2021 the 510k submission is intended to bring the regulatory clearance for the bd alaris™ system uptodate address open recall issues and provide other updates and features including a new version of bd alaris™ system software that will provide clinical operational and cybersecurity updates we will not be able to fully resume commercial operations for the bd alaris™ system in the us until bd’s 510k submission relating to the product has been cleared by the fda no assurances can be given as to when or if clearance will be obtained from the fda 

fda warning letter 

on january 11 2018 bd received a warning letter from the fda with respect to our former bd preanalytical systems pas unit citing certain alleged violations of quality system regulations and of law the warning letter states that until bd resolves the outstanding issues covered by the warning letter the fda will not clear or approve any premarket submissions for class iii devices to which the nonconformances are reasonably related or grant requests for certificates to foreign governments bd has worked closely with the fda and implemented corrective actions to address the quality management system concerns identified in the warning letter in march 2020 the fda conducted a subsequent inspection of pas which it classified as voluntary action indicated which means the fda will not take or recommend any administrative or regulatory action as a result of the unit’s response to the observations associated with the quality management concerns in the inspection bd continues to work with the fda to generate additional clinical evidence and file 510ks as remaining commitments associated with the warning letter in january 2022 bd received fda clearance for 

its bd vacutainer ® acd blood collection tubes used in immunohematology the fda review of these remaining commitments is ongoing and no assurances can be given regarding further action by the fda as a result of these commitments including but not limited to action pursuant to the warning letter 

ethylene oxideconsent order  covington georgia usa 

on october 28 2019 bd entered into a consent order with the environmental protection division of the georgia department of natural resources the “epd” following the filing of a complaint and motion for temporary restraining order by the epd seeking to enjoin bd from continuing sterilization operations at its covington georgia facility under the terms of the consent order which has been amended two times upon mutual agreement of bd and epd bd voluntarily agreed to a nu mber of operational changes at its covington and madison georgia facilities as well as at its distribution center in covington designed to further reduce ethylene oxide emissions including but not limited to operating at a reduced capacity until successful implementation of fugitive emission control technology ongoing ambient air monitoring and operational controls at such facilities following submission of data relating to the implementation of these operational changes bd was permitted to return to normal operations in december 2021 at its facilities in georgia in accordance with the operating conditions set forth in its permit applications including a condition to continue ambient air monitoring however bd’s sterilization operations in georgia remain subject to the epd’s final approval of bd’s air permit applications and could be subject to additional restrictions bd has business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of any additional restrictions on our operations at these facilities although it is possible that these plans will not be able to fully offset such impact especially considering the reduced capacity of thirdparty sterilization service providers and the regulatory timelines associated with transferring sterilization operations for regulated products 

at a broader level there is increased focus on the use and emission of ethylene oxide by the us environmental protection agency and state environmental regulatory agencies additional regulatory requirements associated with the use and emission of ethylene oxide may be imposed in the future either domestically or outside the us ethylene oxide is the most frequently used sterilant for medical devices and healthcare products in the us and in certain cases is the only option to sterilize critical medical device products for the safe administration to patients this increased regulation could require bd or sterilization service providers including providers used by bd to temporarily suspend operations to install additional fugitive emissions control technology limit the use of ethylene oxide or take other actions which would impact bd’s operations and further reduce the available capacity to sterilize medical devices and healthcare products and could also result in additional costs a few states have filed lawsuits to require additional air quality controls and expand limitations on the use of ethylene oxide at sterilization facilities for example in december 2020 the state of new mexico filed a lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary and permanent injunction against a major medical device sterilizer which sterilizes certain of our surgery products to reduce ethylene oxide emissions associated with their sterilization process on the federal level in late 2019 the us environmental protection agency provided notice that it would be conducting rulemaking to reconsider federal regulations applicable to the use and emission of ethylene oxide and there continues to be increased focus on the use and emission of ethylene oxide on the federal level in anticipation of these proposed revisions to federal air regulations for commercial sterilizers in the us bd is installing fugitive emissions controls at our facilities in east columbus ne and sandy ut it is possible that there may also be increased regulation outside the us if any existing regulatory requirements or any such proceedings or rulemaking result in the suspension or interruption of sterilization operations at bd or at medical device sterilizers used by bd or otherwise limit the availability of thirdparty sterilization capacity this could interrupt or otherwise adversely impact production of certain of our products or lead to civil litigation or other claims against bd bd has business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of any such disruptions although these plans may not be able to fully offset such impact for the reasons noted above

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the material risks that could adversely affect bd’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows we may also be adversely impacted by other risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

business economic and industry risks 

we are subject to risks associated with public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics including the covid19 pandemic which may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business the nature and extent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

we are subject to risks associated with public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics including the covid19 pandemic while many countries around the world have removed or reduced the restrictions taken in response to the covid19 pandemic the emergence of new variants of the sarscov2 virus may result in new governmental lockdowns quarantine requirements or other restrictions to slow the spread of the virus this could result in significant reductions in the demand for certain of our products due to reductions in elective and nonessential procedures lower utilization of routine testing and related specimen collection reduced capital spend by customers decreases in research activity due to laboratory closures and reduced clinical testing as well as hospital and clinical occupancy and healthcare system staffing shortages these measures could also include determinations that our or our suppliers’ facilities are not essential businesses which could result in closures or other restrictions that significantly disrupt our operations or those of distributors or suppliers in our supply chain in addition any such measures could also impact the global 

economy more broadly for example by leading to further economic slowdowns while covid19 case volumes have decreased in the us and certain other countries the global outlook remains uncertain as case counts fluctuate and vaccination and booster rates remain relatively low in many parts of the world going forward medical procedure rates may vary by country based on regional infection and vaccination and booster rates hospital occupancy and staffing levels transportation limitations quarantines and other restrictions and the emergence of new variants of the sarscov2 virus 

in addition the covid19 pandemic has impacted our global supply chain network and we may continue to experience significant challenges in our network including shortages in supply or disruptions or delays in shipments as well as price increases of certain materials or components used in our products the covid19 pandemic has escalated challenges that existed for global healthcare systems prior to the pandemic including budget constraints and staffing shortages particularly shortages of nursing staff that could impact the future demand for our products and services as covid19 conditions have improved there have been increases in demand for certain of our products which may pose challenges to our supply chain and could adversely affect our business in addition in response to the pandemic we developed and launched multiple products for the detection and identification of covid19 including tests for our bd max™ molecular system and bd veritor™ plus system and there are a number of factors including vaccination and booster rates and the availability of competitive products that have impacted in the past and could impact in the future the level of demand and pricing for our covid19 diagnostics testing 

the scope and duration of any future public health crisis including the potential emergence of new variants of the sarscov2 virus the pace at which government restrictions are imposed and lifted the scope of additional actions taken to mitigate the spread of disease global vaccination and booster rates the speed and extent to which global markets and utilization rates for our products fully recover from the disruptions caused by such a public health crisis and the impact of these factors on our business financial condition and results of 

operations will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic or other public health crises adversely affect our operations and global economic conditions more generally it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein 

global economic conditions including inflation and supply chain disruptions could continue to adversely affect our operations 

general global economic downturns and macroeconomic trends including heightened inflation capital market volatility interest rate and currency rate fluctuations and economic slowdown or recession may result in unfavorable conditions that could negatively affect demand for our products and exacerbate some of the other risks that affect our business financial condition and results of operations both domestic and international markets experienced significant inflationary pressures in fiscal year 2022 and inflation rates in the us as well as in other countries in which we operate are currently expected to continue at elevated levels for the nearterm in addition the federal reserve in the us and other central banks in various countries have raised and may again raise interest rates in response to concerns about inflation which coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks interest rate increases or other government actions taken to reduce inflation could also result in recessionary pressures in many parts of the world furthermore currency exchange rates have been especially volatile in the recent past and these currency fluctuations have affected and may continue to affect the reported value of our assets and liabilities as well as our cash flows 

we have also experienced significant challenges in our global supply chain including shortages in supply or disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components used in our products and related price increases while to date we have been able to manage the challenges associated with these delays and shortages without significant disruption to our business no assurance can be given that these efforts will continue to be successful deterioration in the domestic or international economic environment particularly in emerging markets and countries with governmentsponsored healthcare systems may cause decreased demand for our products and services and increased competition which could result in lower sales volume and lower prices for our products longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies as well as increase the cost of operating our business or contribute to disruptions in our supply chain in addition we have previously experienced delays in collecting government receivables in certain countries due to economic conditions and we may experience similar delays in the future in these and other countries or regions experiencing financial problems 

the medical technology industry is very competitive 

we are a global company that faces significant competition from a wide range of existing competitors and new market entrants these include large medical device companies with multiple product lines some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do as well as firms which are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines nontraditional entrants such as technology companies are also entering into the healthcare industry and some may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we face competition across all our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features clinical or economic outcomes product quality availability price services and other factors our ability to compete is also impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements such as increased demand for more environmentally friendly products and for products incorporating digital capabilities as well as changes in the ways healthcare services are delivered including the transition of more care from acute to nonacute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management the shift of care from acute to nonacute settings may also place financial pressure on hospitals and broader healthcare systems that could result in less demand for our products and services cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs improve clinical results and expand patient access changes in regulatory or market standards including without limitation cybersecurity requirements often require significant investment to maintain compliance to relevant standards our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we meet these 

changing market regulatory and cybersecurity demands in terms of our product offerings and marketing approaches 

the medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change discovery and frequent product introductions the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology that provide better features pricing clinical outcomes or economic value may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device lower cost producers have also created pricing pressure particularly in developing markets 

the medical technology industry has also experienced a significant amount of consolidation resulting in companies with greater scale and market presence than bd traditional distributors are also manufacturers of medical devices providing another source of competition in addition healthcare systems and other providers are consolidating resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies as a result competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the demand for and prices of our products 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

a substantial amount of our revenue is derived from international operations and we anticipate that a significant portion of our future sales will continue to come from outside the us the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the us may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which are caused by a number of factors including changes in a countrys political and economic policies and inflationary conditions fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of bd’s assets and liabilities as well as our cash flows a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations any exchange rate hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can effectively mitigate these risks 

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers or other cost containment measures could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities including medicare medicaid and comparable foreign programs and private insurers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources and by country may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction reimbursement rates can also affect the market acceptance rate of new technologies and products reforms to reimbursement systems in the us or abroad changes in coverage or reimbursement rates by private payers or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products which could adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business 

initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs in the us and other countries where we do business may also put industrywide pressure on medical device or clinical diagnostic pricing in the us these include among others valuebased purchasing and managed care arrangements governments in china and other countries are also using various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures including increased use of competitive bidding and tenders as well as price regulation 

our future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development new product development requires significant investment in rd clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products and technologies successfully complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the us and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protections and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance if we are unable to develop and launch new products our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be negatively impacted additionally the ongoing global semiconductor chip and component shortage could impact certain critical components of our rd process which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our international operations subject us to certain business risks 

a substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the us and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets especially in emerging markets our foreign operations subject us to certain commercial political and financial risks in addition to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above our business in these foreign markets is subject to general political conditions including any political instability such as those resulting from war terrorism and insurrections and general economic conditions in these markets such as inflation deflation interest rate volatility and credit availability additionally a number of factors including us relations with the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate changes to international trade agreements and treaties increases in trade protectionism or the weakening or loss of certain intellectual property protection rights in some countries may affect our business financial condition and results of operations foreign regulatory requirements including those related to the testing authorization and labeling of products and import or export licensing requirements could affect the availability of our products in these markets in addition to these broader market conditions our operations may also be impacted by a variety of local factors such as competition from local companies local product preferences and requirements and changes in local healthcare payment systems and healthcare delivery systems we also experience longer payment terms for account receivables in foreign jurisdictions than we experience in the us and we face increased difficulty in establishing staffing and managing our foreign operations 

the success of our operations outside the us also depends in part on our ability to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and sales and distribution networks these and other factors may adversely impact our ability to pursue our growth strategy in these markets 

in addition our international operations are governed by the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more enforcement proceedings by us and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties while we have implemented policies and procedures relating to compliance with these laws our international operations which often involve customer relationships with foreign governments create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees consultants sales agents or distributors any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations and significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities and negatively affect our reputation 

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our business 

we sell products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and similar agencies in other countries the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable for instance certain nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods the availability of governmental research funding may be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions particularly during periods of economic uncertainty any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 

we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 

our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense additionally we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical manufacturing and distribution experience to operate our business successfully our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including how bd’s compensation benefits work location and work environment compares with those offered by our competitors and other local employers there has been an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base could lead to increased costs such as an increase in overtime necessary to meet demand and increased wages and benefit costs to attract and retain skilled employees and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and skilled employees we could encounter operational disruptions or other negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations 

the military conflict between russia and ukraine may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the military conflict in ukraine has increased global economic and political uncertainty furthermore governments in the us united kingdom and european union have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in russia and additional controls and sanctions could be enacted in the future we are continuing to actively monitor the situation in russia and ukraine and assess its impact on our business including our suppliers and customers we have no manufacturing facilities or significant operations in russia or ukraine and as such to date the conflict has not had a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations however it is possible that the conflict in ukraine may escalate or expand and the scope extent and duration of the military action current or future sanctions and resulting market and geopolitical disruptions could be significant we cannot predict the impact the conflict may have on the global economy or our business financial condition and operations in the future the russia and ukraine conflict may also heighten the impact of other risks factors described herein these potential effects could include but are not limited to increased inflation volatility in prices for transportation energy commodities and other raw materials constraints on the availability for us and our suppliers of commodities and other raw materials including cobalt and energy sources disruptions in the global supply chain decreased demand for certain of our products disruptions to our global technology infrastructure including through cyberattacks ransom attacks or cyberintrusion adverse changes in international trade policies and relations increased exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and constraints volatility or disruptions in the credit and capital markets 

operational risks 

breaches or breakdowns of our information and technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we are increasingly reliant upon a number of information and technology systems to operate our business we process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations including 

sensitive personal or proprietary information in addition we rely on networks and services including internet sites cloud and softwareasaservice “saas” solutions data hosting and processing facilities tools and other hardware software including opensource software and technical applications and platforms including some that are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparty providers to assist in conducting our business some of our products include information systems that collect data regarding patients and patient therapy on behalf of our customers and some connect to our systems for maintenance purposes 

cyberattacks continue to increase in their frequency sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect for periods of time especially as they relate to attacks on thirdparty providers or their vendors such attacks are often carried out by motivated and highly skilled actors who are increasingly wellresourced our information systems as well as those of various third parties on which we rely have been subjected to and are likely to continue to experience a variety of attacks including but not limited to malicious code execution and cyber or phishing attacks we have also experienced instances of unauthorized access to our systems in the past and expect to be subject to similar cyberattacks in the future in this increasingly hostile environment we or our thirdparty providers could suffer a loss or disclosure of certain business information or information regarding third parties stored in our systems due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches these breaches and cyberattacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential or proprietary information being accessed destroyed or stolen which could adversely affect our competitive position in the market likewise we or our thirdparty providers could suffer disruption of our operations and other significant negative consequences including increased costs for security measures or remediation lost revenue manufacturing challenges or disruption diversion of management attention reputational damage litigation and damage to our relationships with vendors business partners and customers 

unauthorized tampering adulteration or interference with our products may also create issues with product functionality that could result in a loss of data risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions cyberattacks could also result in unauthorized access to our systems and products which could also impact our compliance with privacy and other laws and regulations and could result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation 

while we have made investments to address these threats and continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access of our systems and products and we continue to work with government authorities and thirdparty providers to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated frequent and adaptive there can be no assurances that these protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a material adverse impact on our business 

cost volatility could adversely affect our operations  

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials components labor freight and energy that in turn increases the costs of producing and distributing our products new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy and transportation costs as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components in particular we purchase supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products and any significant increases in resin costs whether due to inflationary pressure supply constraints regulatory changes or otherwise  could adversely impact future operating results increases in oil prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs the costs of raw materials transportation construction services and energy necessary for the production and distribution of our products continues to increase and be volatile these prices may continue to fluctuate based on many factors beyond our control including but not limited to changes in general economic conditions labor costs transportation costs competition and currency exchange rates while we have implemented cost containment measures selective price increases and taken other actions to mitigate these inflationary pressures in our supply chain we may not be able to completely offset all the increases in our operational costs 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components could adversely affect our operating results 

we purchase many different types of raw materials and components used in our products some of which are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons certain raw materials and components are purchased from sole suppliers the price and supply of these materials and components may be impacted or disrupted for reasons beyond our control including supplier shutdowns supplier capacity constraints transportation delays inflationary pricing pressures work stoppages labor shortages geopolitical developments and governmental regulatory actions we have experienced and may continue to experience significant challenges to our global transportation channels and other aspects of our global supply chain network including to the cost and availability of raw materials and components due to shortages and cost inflation 

the us and other governments may enact or use laws and regulations such as the defense production act or export restrictions to ensure availability of needed covid19 testing and vaccination delivery devices or to address other national emergencies any such action may impact our global supply chain network while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply and service no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

interruption of our manufacturing or sterilization operations could adversely affect our business 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants interruption to our manufacturing operations resulting from weather or natural disasters regulatory requirements equipment failure or other issues in our manufacturing process could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in some instances we may not be able to transition manufacturing to other bd sites or a third party to replace the lost production a significant interruption of our manufacturing operations could result in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers 

in addition many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize both bd facilities and third parties for this process in some instances only a few facilities are qualified under applicable regulations to conduct this sterilization to the extent we or our thirdparty providers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to lack of capacity availability of materials for sterilization including cobalt regulatory requirements or otherwise we may be unable to transition sterilization to other sites or modalities in a timely or costeffective manner or at all which could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

at a broader level there is increased focus on the use and emission of ethylene oxide by the us environmental protection agency and state environmental regulatory agencies additional regulatory requirements associated with the use and emission of ethylene oxide for sterilization may be imposed in the future both domestically and outside the us this increased regulation could require bd or sterilization service providers including providers used by bd to temporarily suspend operations to install additional fugitive emissions control technology limit the use of ethylene oxide or take other actions which would impact bd’s operations and further reduce the available capacity to sterilize medical devices and healthcare products and could also result in additional costs governmental agencies may also regulate the use and emission of ethylene oxide if any existing regulatory requirements or any such regulatory actions or rulemaking result in the suspension or interruption of sterilization operations at bd or at medical device sterilizers used by bd or otherwise limit the availability of thirdparty sterilization capacity this could interrupt or otherwise adversely impact production of certain of our products or lead to civil litigation or other claims against bd bd has business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of any such disruption although these plans may not be able to fully offset such impact for the reasons noted above see “item 1 business  regulation” for a 

discussion of the consent order bd entered into with the environmental protection division of the georgia department of natural resources and the risk related to sterilization operations generally 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases “ghg” in the atmosphere may present risks to our business and operations extreme weather or other conditions such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms wildfires or flooding which may result from climate change could adversely impact our operations and supply chain including the availability and cost of raw materials and components required for the operation of our business and human capital issues for bd and companies within our supply chain in addition access to and pricing of certain natural resources such as water could impact our manufacturing operations such conditions could also result in physical damage to our products plants and distribution centers as well as the infrastructure and facilities of our suppliers and of hospitals medical care facilities and other customers 

there has been increased focus by federal international state and local regulatory and legislative bodies to combat andor limit the effects of climate change through a variety of means including regulating greenhouse gas emissions and the establishment of enhanced internal processes or systems to track them policies mandating or promoting the use of renewable or zerocarbon energy and sustainability initiatives and additional taxes on fuel and energy if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the united states or in any other jurisdiction in which we do business that impose more stringent restrictions and requirements than our current legal or regulatory obligations we and companies in our supply chain may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations which could cause disruption in the sourcing manufacturing and distribution of our products and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

additionally the impacts of climate change may further influence customer preferences and requirements such as increased demand for products with lower environmental footprints and for companies to produce and demonstrate progress against ghg reduction plans and targets failure to provide climatefriendly products or demonstrate ghg reductions could potentially result in loss of market share 

legal quality and regulatory risks 

we are subject to lawsuits 

we are or have been a defendant in a number of lawsuits including among others purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and violations of federal securities laws product liability claims which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multidistrict litigation proceedings including pending claims relating to our hernia repair implant products surgical continence and pelvic organ prolapse products for women and vena cava filter products and suits alleging patent infringement we have also been subject to government subpoenas and civil investigative demands seeking information with respect to alleged violations of law including in connection with federal andor state healthcare programs such as medicare or medicaid federal contracting requirements andor sales and marketing practices a more detailed description of certain litigation to which we are a party is contained in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we could be subject to additional lawsuits governmental investigations subpoenas and civil investigative demands in the future any such lawsuits governmental investigations subpoenas and civil investigative demands could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could distract management from the operations of the business 

reserves established for estimated losses with respect to legal proceedings do not represent an exact calculation of our actual liability but instead represent our estimate of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and our underlying loss reserve estimates additional reserves may be established or current reserves may be significantly increased from timetotime also in some instances we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges materially in 

excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor liquidity 

with respect to certain litigation we believe that some settlements and judgments as well as legal defense costs may be covered in whole or in part under applicable insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies or in some circumstances indemnification obligations owed to us by other parties however amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages andor costs in addition there is no guarantee that insurers or other parties will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available also for certain product liability claims or lawsuits bd does not maintain or has limited remaining insurance coverage and we may not be able to obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms or at all that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 

we are subject to extensive regulation 

our operations are global and are affected by complex state federal and international laws relating to healthcare environmental protection occupational health and safety antitrust anticorruption marketing fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws export control product safety and efficacy employment privacy and other areas violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and in some cases exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid environmental laws particularly with respect to climate change and the emission of greenhouse gases are also becoming more stringent throughout the world which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate closures of or changes to our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers or result in liability to bd the enactment of additional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations and financial performance 

we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of our products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may require us to incur significant costs in terms of time and resources and these costs have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda and comparable governing bodies for supporting data for submissions the regulatory process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of our products governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration including but not limited to labeling updates or changes to prohibited materials that require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries 

following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting and other post market requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production marketing or sale of our products and result in delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances warning letters or consent decrees closure of manufacturing sites import bans seizures or recalls of products civil or criminal sanctions and damage to our reputation more stringent oversight by the fda and other agencies in recent years has resulted in increased enforcement activity which increases our compliance risk 

we are operating under an amended consent decree with the fda entered into by carefusion in 2007 and amended in 2009 that affects our bd alaris™ infusion pump business in the us we are also currently operating under a warning letter issued by the fda for more information regarding the consent decree and warning letter see “regulation” under item 1 business 

as previously disclosed we are undertaking certain remediation of our bd alaris™ system and are currently shipping the product in the us only in cases of medical necessity and to remediate recalled software versions we will not be able to fully resume commercial operations for the bd alaris™ system in the us until a 510k submission relating to the product has been cleared by the fda no assurance can be given as to when or if clearance will be obtained from the fda 

in addition the european union “eu” has adopted the eu medical device regulation the “eu mdr” and the in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices including in the area of clinical evidence requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance the eu mdr has been fully operational for previously approved selfcertified medical devices since may 2021 and companies have until may 2024 to meet the requirements for medical devices with a valid conformity assessment certificate the eu ivdr has been fully applicable for manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic medical devices since may 2022 complying with and maintaining devices under these regulations requires us to incur significant expenditures additionally the availability of eu notified body services certified to the new requirements is limited which may delay the marketing approval for some of our products under the eu mdr any such delays or any failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to eu conformity requirements 

we are also subject to complex and frequently changing privacy and data protection laws rules and regulations in the us as well as in all other regions where bd operates regarding the collection use storage transfer and other processing of personal information these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations require changes to our policies practices and processes and in some cases impose restrictions on our use or storage of personal information these limitations and restrictions could require us to modify current or future products or services which may harm our future financial results any actual or perceived noncompliance with these laws rules and regulations our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing the processing of personal information could result in significant consequences for bd including among other things business interruption sanctions and significant pecuniary fines regulatory inquiries and investigations adverse publicity loss of competitive advantage and customer trust as well as privacy litigation and civil lawsuits with damages 

the importance of privacy laws rules and regulations for the healthcare and medtech industry specifically is constantly growing as personal data has become an integral part of doing business in our sector and the legal standards are evolving and becoming more complex worldwide for instance the european general data protection regulation the “gdpr” applicable as of 2018 and still one of the strictest and most comprehensive privacy laws in the world is being continuously enforced and increasingly heavy fines are now being levied on businesses fines for noncompliance with the gdpr can amount to up to €20 million or 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover from the preceding financial year whichever is higher and may be imposed in conjunction with the exercise of the authority’s investigatory and corrective powers the gdpr’s extraterritorial scope makes it applicable to our usbased legal entities whenever our business activities systems and products process the personal data of eu residents additionally privacy laws rules and regulations are also rapidly developing in other regions including china brazil south korea and is expanding through the us state by state eg california virginia colorado connecticut utah in parallel with federal privacy laws protecting sensitive health information these varying laws rules regulations and industry standards impact bd businesses to the extent they rely on the use of personal data and create significant compliance challenges while maintaining our global reach in addition certain privacy and data protection laws may apply to us indirectly through our customers manufacturers suppliers or other thirdparty partners for example noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations by a thirdparty partner that is processing personal data on our behalf may be deemed noncompliance by us or a failure by us to conduct proper due diligence on the third party we also could be subject to additional expenses and liabilities in the event of an information security incident including a cybersecurity breach or the failure of an information technology system owned or operated by us or a third party with which we partner or its vendor 

defects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects component failures unapproved or improper use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events such events have in the past and could in the future lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or as required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result 

in significant costs and lost sales and customers enforcement actions andor investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of postmarket approval requirements 

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 

many of our businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property assets these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position in addition competitors may seek to invalidate patents on our products or claim that our products infringe upon misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property which could result in a loss of competitive advantage or the payment of significant legal fees damage awards and past or future royalties as well as injunctions against future sales of our products we also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the us which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries 

we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow with which we seek to protect our products in part by confidentiality agreements with certain employees consultants and other parties these agreements may not adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 

the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

we may not be able to service all of our indebtedness 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments however our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations of the combined company and to utilize other methods to make scheduled payments will depend on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control there can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures seek additional capital sell assets or refinance our indebtedness any such action may not be successful and we may be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations additionally we may not be able to refinance existing debt on favorable or comparable terms 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to among other things have liens on our property andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person engage in certain transactions with affiliates and change the nature of our business in addition the agreements also require us to comply with certain financial covenants including financial ratios our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations 

risks relating to the spinoff of embecta corp 

risks relating to spinoff of embecta corp 

on april 1 2022 we completed the spinoff of embecta corp embecta nasdaq embc which holds our former diabetes care business and is now one of the world’s largest pureplay diabetes management companies in the world the spinoff is intended to be a taxfree transaction for us federal income tax purposes if any facts assumptions representations and undertakings from bd and embecta regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied the spinoff may not qualify for taxfree treatment which could result in significant us federal income tax liabilities for bd and its shareholders additionally there can be no assurances that bd will be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the spinoff 

general business risks 

we cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

we seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky and the integration of any newlyacquired business requires significant effort and management attention the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 

natural disasters war and other events beyond our control could disrupt our business and adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes wildfires and floods and other extreme weather events including those caused by climate change war global health crises terrorism social or political unrest labor disruptions and international conflicts and other events beyond our control and actions taken by the us and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the us and areas outside of the us in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers

bd’s spinoff of diabetes care 

on april 1 2022 bd completed the separation and distribution of embecta formerly bds diabetes care business into a separate publiclytraded company the historical results of the diabetes care business previously included in bd’s medical segment as well as interest expense related to indebtedness incurred by embecta prior to the spinoff date have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to the spinoff date of april 1 2022 additional disclosures regarding our spinoff of the diabetes care business are provided in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

key trends affecting results of operations 

as noted above our products are manufactured and sold worldwide which exposes our operations supply chain and suppliers to various global macroeconomic factors the factors which were most impactful to our fiscal year 2022 results and that continue to be impactful to our operating results include the following 

• inflation which has increased the costs of raw materials components labor energy and logistical services 

• availability of skilled labor especially in north america global energy sources raw materials and electronic components and 

• constrained logistics capacity related to the movement of goods around the globe 

during fiscal year 2022 the shortages of certain raw materials and components delays in global transportation and labor shortages in our manufacturing facilities increased lead times for some of our product 

offerings also significant inflationary pressures impacted our supply chain costs in certain areas throughout 2022 we experienced higher costs for raw materials particularly resins as well as for electronic components and freight these increased costs put pressure on our operating expenses and the costs of our investments we have been mitigating these inflationary pressures through the following 

• driving strategic procurement initiatives to leverage alternative sources of raw material and transportation 

• implementing costcontainment measures as well as intensifying continuous improvement and restructuring programs in our manufacturing and distribution facilities 

• continuing strategic product line rationalization programs as part of our simplification strategy and 

• optimizing our sales through product allocation and customer management 

the covid19 pandemic continued to drive volatile global economic conditions during our fiscal year 2022 utilization rates for most of our products have recovered compared to prepandemic levels however future resurgences in covid19 infections or new strains of the virus may affect the prioritization of nonacute versus acute healthcare utilization which may temporarily weaken future demand for certain of our products and increase the demand for other of our products the pandemic has contributed to the inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions discussed above and these challenges could persist if governments impose lockdowns quarantine requirements and other restrictions in order to control rates of covid19 infections such as in china 

additionally the pandemic has escalated challenges that existed for global healthcare systems prior to the pandemic including budget constraints and staffing shortages particularly shortages of nursing staff changes in the ways healthcare services are delivered including the transition of more care from acute to nonacute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management may place additional financial pressure on hospitals and the broader healthcare system healthcare institutions may take actions to mitigate any persistent pressures on their budgets and such actions could impact the future demand for our products and services additionally staffing shortages within healthcare systems may affect the prioritization of healthcare services which could also impact the demand for certain of our products 

geopolitical conditions may also impact our operations our operations in russia and ukraine are not material to our financial results and as such the conflict between russia and ukraine did not materially impact our results of operations in 2022 however the continuation of the russiaukraine military conflict andor an escalation of the conflict beyond its current scope may further weaken the global economy and could result in additional inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints including the unavailability and cost of energy due to the significant uncertainty that exists relative to the duration and overall impact of the macroeconomic factors discussed above our future operating performance particularly in the shortterm may be subject to volatility the impacts of macroeconomic conditions on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows are dependent on certain factors including those discussed in item 1a risk factors 

summary of financial results 

worldwide revenues in 2022 of 18870 billion decreased 14 from the prioryear period this decrease reflected the following impacts 

 

while resurgences of covid19 infections have continued to occur in various countries around the world demand for our sarscov2 diagnostics tests and injection devices used for covid19 vaccinations has declined from the peak testing and vaccination levels reached earlier in the pandemic as such our fiscal year 2022 revenues in our life sciences segment reflected sales related to covid19only diagnostic testing on the bd veritor tm plus bd veritor tm athome and bd max tm systems of 511 million compared with revenues from such testing products in 2021 of 1956 billion 

volume in 2022 was driven by demand for our core products and reflected strong demand across all of our segments’ units particularly in the medical segment’s medication delivery solutions and pharmaceutical systems units as well as in the life sciences segment’s integrated diagnostic solutions unit 

we continue to invest in research and development strategic tuckin acquisitions geographic expansion and new product programs to drive further revenue and profit growth our ability to sustain our longterm growth will depend on a number of factors including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion develop innovative new products and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness as further discussed above current global economic conditions have been relatively volatile due to various macroeconomic factors we are mitigating the inflationary pressures on our businesses through the various strategies discussed above however there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively mitigate such inflationary pressures in future periods and an inability to offset inflationary pressures at least in part through the strategies discussed above could adversely impact our results of operations 

our financial position remains strong with cash flows from continuing operating activities totaling 2471 billion in 2022 at september 30 2022 we had 1167 billion in cash and equivalents and shortterm investments including restricted cash we continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends during fiscal year 2022 we paid cash dividends of 1082 billion including 992 million paid to common shareholders and 90 million paid to preferred shareholders we also repurchased approximately 500 million of our common stock during fiscal year 2022 

each reporting period we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period a stronger us dollar compared to the prioryear period resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenues during 2022 the flow of foreign currency impacts to our earnings depends on various factors including our inventory turnover our ability to leverage our global supply chain and the currentperiod mix of our sales from both a product and geographic perspective these factors resulted in a favorable foreign currency impact to earnings during 2022 

we evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currencyneutral basis which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currencyneutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods foreign currencyneutral fxn information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a foreign currencyneutral basis as one measure to evaluate our performance we calculate foreign currencyneutral percentages by converting our currentperiod local currency financial results using the priorperiod foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our currentperiod results these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap results on a foreign currencyneutral basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap

bd and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout europe greater asia canada and latin america we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency these payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions we hedge substantially all such exposures primarily through the use of forward contracts we have also hedged the currency exposure associated with investments in certain foreign subsidiaries with instruments such as foreign currencydenominated debt and crosscurrency swaps which are designated as net investment hedges as well as currency exchange contracts we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations including sales to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period we did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against these foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2022 or 2021 

derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value for foreign currency derivatives market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities 

with respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2022 and 2021 the impact that changes in the us dollar would have on pretax earnings was estimated as follows 



these calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments 

interest rate risk 

when managing interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments we may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interestbearing investments in tandem since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure for interest rate derivative instruments fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using marketbased observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield 

curves market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities 

the impact that changes in interest rates would have on interest rate derivatives outstanding at september 30 2022 and 2021 as well as the effect that changes in interest rates would have on our earnings or cash flows over a oneyear period based upon our overall interest rate exposure were estimated as follows 



liquidity and capital resources

financing facilities 

we have a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility in place which will expire in september 2026 the credit facility provides borrowings of up to 275 billion with separate sublimits of 100 million for letters of credit and swingline loans the expiration date of the credit facility may be extended for up to two additional one year periods subject to certain restrictions including the consent of the lenders the credit facility provides that we may subject to additional commitments by lenders request an additional 500 million of financing for a maximum aggregate commitment under the credit facility of up to 325 billion proceeds from this facility may be used for general corporate purposes there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at september 30 2022 

the agreement for our revolving credit facility contains the following financial covenants we were in compliance with these covenants as applicable as of september 30 2022 

• we are required to have a leverage coverage ratio of no more than 

◦ 425to1 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter following the closing of the credit facility or 

◦ 475to1 for the four full fiscal quarters following the consummation of a material acquisition 

we also have informal lines of credit outside the united states we may from time to time access the commercial paper market as we manage working capital over the normal course of our business activities we had 230 million commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of september 30 2022 also over the normal course of our business activities we transfer certain trade receivable assets to third parties under factoring agreements additional disclosures regarding sales of trade receivable assets are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

access to capital and credit ratings 

our corporate credit ratings with the rating agencies standard  poors ratings services “sp” moodys investor service “moodys” and fitch ratings “fitch” were as follows at september 30 2022 



in june 2022 moody’s investors service “moody’s” upgraded our senior unsecured rating to baa2 from baa3 moody’s also updated bd’s commercial paper rating to p2 from p3 and revised its outlook on our ratings from positive to stable also in june 2022 fitch ratings “fitch” upgraded our senior unsecured rating to bbb from bbb and revised its outlook on our ratings from positive to stable in addition fitch assigned us with a commercial paper rating of f2 our corporate credit ratings with standard  poors ratings services at september 30 2022 were unchanged compared with our ratings at september 30 2021 

lower corporate debt ratings and downgrades of our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing we believe that given our debt ratings our financial management policies our ability to generate cash flow and the noncyclical geographically diversified nature of our businesses we would have access to additional shortterm and longterm capital should the need arise a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change 

contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future information regarding our obligations under purchase debt and lease arrangements are provided in notes 6 16 and 18 respectively to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

critical accounting policies 

the following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold which is generally upon shipment or delivery depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex and therefore significantly affects the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the product are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed for certain service arrangements including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term the majority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain instruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period 

our agreements with customers within certain organizational units including medication management solutions integrated diagnostic solutions and biosciences contain multiple performance obligations including both products and certain services noted above determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require judgment the transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price standalone selling price is the amount at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer we generally estimate standalone selling prices using list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers the use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral 

our gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions which include rebates and sales discounts these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and judgment is required when determining the impact 

on gross revenues for a reporting period additional factors considered in the estimate of our rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to our distributors as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates 

impairment of assets 

goodwill assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with finite lives including developed technology and other longlived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units generally represent one level below reporting segments our review of goodwill for each reporting unit compares the fair value of the reporting unit estimated using an income approach with its carrying value our annual goodwill impairment test performed on july 1 2022 did not result in any impairment charges as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

we generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures the value of our income producing assets this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use appropriate discount rates terminal values and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with bd’s business plans the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset actual results may differ from management’s estimates 

income taxes 

bd maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 

bd conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions our past audit experience with similar situations and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters bd’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if upon resolution with taxing authorities we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

we have reviewed our needs in the united states for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and we continue to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the united states to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property plant and equipment expenditure needs as a result we are permanently reinvested with respect to all of our historical foreign earnings as of september 30 2022 additional disclosures regarding our accounting for income taxes are provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

contingencies 

we are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including without limitation product liability and environmental matters as further discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses we establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in 

the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries a determination of the amount of accruals for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual matter when appropriate the accrual is developed with the consultation of outside counsel and as in the case of certain mass tort litigation the expertise of an actuarial specialist regarding the nature timing and extent of each matter the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our litigation strategy we record expected recoveries from product liability insurance carriers or other parties when realization of recovery is deemed probable 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows 

benefit plans 

we have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations that are measured using actuarial valuations which include assumptions for the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

the discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date september 30 specifically for the us plans we will use a discount rate of 562 for 2023 which was based on an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date to calculate the pension expense in 2023 we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2023 are provided in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption although reviewed each year changes less frequently due to the longterm nature of the assumption this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date rather it is used only in the calculation of pension expense to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider many factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results benchmark data expected returns on various plan asset classes as well as current and expected asset allocations we will use a longterm expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 725 for the us pension plan in 2023 we believe our discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our us pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows 

• discount rate — a change of plus minus 25 basis points with other assumptions held constant would have an estimated 7 million favorable unfavorable impact on the total us net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan costs this estimate assumes no change in the shape or steepness of the companyspecific yield curve used to plot the individual spot rates that will be applied to the future cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost 

• expected return on plan assets — a change of plus minus 25 basis points with other assumptions held constant would have an estimated 4 million favorable unfavorable impact on us pension plan costs

in october 2018 bd completed the sale of its life sciences segment’s advanced bioprocessing business pursuant to a definitive agreement that was signed in september 2018 

additional information regarding this divestiture is contained in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data which is incorporated herein by reference 

international operations 

bd’s products are manufactured and sold worldwide for reporting purposes we organize our operations outside the united states as follows emea which includes europe the middle east and africa greater asia which includes countries in greater china japan south asia southeast asia korea and australia and new zealand latin america which includes mexico central america the caribbean and south america and canada bd has manufacturing operations outside the united states in bosnia and herzegovina brazil canada china dominican republic france germany hungary india ireland israel italy japan malaysia mexico the netherlands singapore spain and the united kingdom geographic information with respect to bd’s operations is included under the heading “geographic information” in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues bd believes its activities in some countries outside the united states involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein as well as the economic environment local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties see further discussion of these risks in item 1a risk factors 

distribution 

bd’s products are marketed and distributed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to hospitals and other healthcare institutions by bd and independent sales representatives bd uses acute care nonacute care laboratory and drug wholesaler distributors to broadly support our overall disposable product demand from our end user customers in the united states in international markets products are distributed either directly or through distributors with the practice varying by country order backlog is not material to bd’s business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis bd’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the medication delivery solutions business unit and flu diagnostic products in the integrated diagnostic systems business unit both of which relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza in order to service its customers optimize logistics lower facilities costs and reduce finished goods inventory levels bd operates consolidated distribution facilities globally 

raw materials and components 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials and components including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products bd seeks to ensure continuity of supply by securing multiple options for sourcing however there are situations where raw materials and components are only available from one supplier which are referred to as sole sourced the use of sole sourced materials and components may be due to sourcing of proprietary andor patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product in other cases while a raw material or component can be sourced from multiple manufacturers only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance cost or other considerations in order to provide alternate sources bd must complete a rigorous qualification process which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval if clinical trials are not required this qualification process 

can take 318 months depending on the criticality of the change when clinical trials are required this process may lengthen the qualification phase from one to three years bd continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and components and maintains business continuity plans with its suppliers bd’s continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities maintaining contingency stock internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts while bd works closely with its suppliers no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful and there may be events that cause supply interruption reduction or termination that adversely impacts bd’s ability to manufacture and sell certain products see further discussion of the risks related to the supply chain and raw materials in item 1a risk factors 

research and development 

bd conducts its research and development “rd” activities at its operating units and across global enterprise centers of excellence located in the united states india china singapore and ireland the majority of bd’s rd activities are conducted in north america outside north america bd has a significant rd presence in greater asia and europe bd also collaborates with certain universities medical centers and other entities on rd programs and retains individual consultants and partners to support its efforts in specialized fields 

intellectual property and licenses 

bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bd’s business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bd’s business as a whole or to any business segment 

competition 

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment in addition the entry into the market of lowcost manufacturers has created increased pricing pressures bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates bd continues to make investments in rd quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement in support of its core strategies see further discussion of the risks relating to competition in the medical technology industry in item 1a risk factors 

thirdparty reimbursement 

reimbursement is an important strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical technology obtaining coverage coding and payment is critical to the commercial success of a new product or procedure difficulty in achieving market access can lead to slow adoption in the marketplace and inadequate payment levels that can continue for months or even years 

a majority of bd’s customers rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures products and services they provide vertical integration has created a very concentrated market among commercial thirdparty payers in the us global payers are increasingly focused on strategies to control spending on healthcare and reward improvements in quality and patient outcomes 

bd is actively engaged in identifying and communicating value propositions of its products for payer provider and patient stakeholders and it employs various efforts and resources to attempt to positively impact coverage coding and payment pathways however bd has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and payment levels for bd products the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer’s discretion as bd’s product offerings are diverse across a variety of healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment pathways that impact the decisions of healthcare providers regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products therefore changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products in any given country for any given product 

as government programs expand healthcare coverage for their citizens they have at the same time sought to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures products or services in addition most payers are seeking price predictability in order to mitigate future exposure to manufacturer price increases this is coupled with an increase in high deductible private insurance plans which transfer more pricing exposure and burden directly to the patient 

many payers both in the us and globally have developed specific payment and delivery mechanisms to support these cost control efforts and to focus on paying for value these mechanisms include payment reductions pay for performance measures qualitybased performance payments restrictive coverage policies bidding and tender mechanics studies to compare the effectiveness of therapies and use of technology assessments these changes whether the result of legislation new strategic alliances or market consolidations have created an increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective and qualitydriven healthcare 

for example as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” the us has implemented valuebased payment methodologies and has created alternative payment models such as bundled payments to continue to drive improved value we see other governments around the world considering similar bundling reform measures with the utilization of the diagnosis related gro up “drg” as a payment mechanism to drive toward quality and resource based reimbursement becoming more common in regions outside the us 

regulation 

general 

bds operations are global and are affected by complex state federal and international laws relating to healthcare environmental protection antitrust anticorruption marketing fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws export control product safety and efficacy employment privacy and other areas 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

bd actively maintains fdaiso quality systems that establish standards for its product design manufacturing and distribution processes prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product 

these agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of bd’s quality systems as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials these regulatory controls as well as any changes in agency policies can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new and existing products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

bd also is subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the united states concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws global anticorruption transportation safety and health and customs and exports many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years this is part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the united states 

in addition as part of ppaca the federal government has enacted the sunshine act provisions requiring bd to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals countries outside the united states have enacted similar local laws requiring medical device companies to report transfers of value to health care providers licensed in those countries failure to comply with these laws could result in a range of fines penalties andor other sanctions 

consent decree with fda 

our infusion pump organizational unit is operating under an amended consent decree entered into by carefusion with the fda in 2007 carefusion’s consent decree with the fda is related to its alaris™ se infusion pumps in february 2009 carefusion and the fda amended the consent decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for carefusion 303 inc the organizational unit that manufactures and sells bd alaris™ infusion pumps in the united states the amended consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories 

while this bd organizational unit remains subject to the amended consent decree which includes the requirements of the original consent decree it has made substantial progress in its compliance efforts however we cannot predict the outcome of this matter and the amended consent decree authorizes the fda in the event of any violations in the future to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing infusion pumps recall products and take other actions we may be required to pay damages of 15000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree up to 15 million per year 

we also cannot currently predict whether additional monetary investment will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matter’s ultimate impact on our business we may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because among other things the fda may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree andor we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree including but not limited to fines penalties other monetary remedies and expansion of the terms of the amended consent decree as of september 30 2021 we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the amended consent decree and accordingly we have no accruals associated with compliance with the amended consent decree 

we are undertaking certain remediation of our bd alaris system and are currently shipping the product in the us only in cases of medical necessity and to remediate recalled software versions we will not be able to fully resume commercial operations for the bd alaris system in the us until a 510k submission relating to the product has been cleared by the fda no assurances can be given as to when or if clearance will be obtained from the fda 

following an inspection that began in march 2020 of our medication management systems facility carefusion 303 inc in san diego california the fda issued to bd a form 483 notice that contains a number of observations of nonconformance bd has provided the fda with its response to the form 483 and has begun to implement certain corrective actions to address the observations however the fda’s review of the items raised in the form 483 remains ongoing and no assurances can be given regarding further action by 

the fda as a result of the observations including but not limited to action pursuant to the amended consent decree 

fda warning letter 

on january 11 2018 bd received a warning letter from the fda with respect to our former bd preanalytical systems pas unit citing certain alleged violations of quality system regulations and of law the warning letter states that until bd resolves the outstanding issues covered by the warning letter the fda will not clear or approve any premarket submissions for class iii devices to which the nonconformances are reasonably related or grant requests for certificates to foreign governments bd has worked closely with the fda and implemented corrective actions to address the quality management system concerns identified in the warning letter in march 2020 the fda conducted a subsequent inspection of pas which it classified as voluntary action indicated which means the fda will not take or recommend any administrative or regulatory action as a result of the unit’s response to the observations associated with the quality management concerns in the inspection bd continues to work with the fda to generate additional clinical evidence and file 510ks as remaining commitments associated with the warning letter the fda review of these remaining commitments is ongoing and no assurances can be given regarding further action by the fda as a result of these commitments including but not limited to action pursuant to the warning letter 

consent order  covington georgia usa 

on october 28 2019 bd entered into a consent order with the environmental protection division of the georgia department of natural resources the “epd” following the filing of a complaint and motion for temporary restraining order by the epd seeking to enjoin bd from continuing sterilization operations at its covington georgia facility under the terms of the consent order which has been amended two times upon mutual agreement of bd and epd bd voluntarily agreed to a nu mber of operational changes at its covington and madison georgia facilities as well as at its distribution center in covington designed to further reduce ethylene oxide emissions including but not limited to operating at a reduced capacity bd does not believe that the consent order will have a material impact on its operations violation of the consent order though could subject us to additional restrictions on the sterilization operations at our covington and madison facilities bd has business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of any additional restrictions on our operations at these facilities although it is possible that these plans will not be able to fully offset such impact especially considering the reduced capacity of thirdparty sterilization service providers and the regulatory timelines associated with transferring sterilization operations for regulated products 

at a broader level several states have increased the regulatory requirements associated with the use and emission of ethylene oxide the most frequently used sterilant for medical devices and health care products in the us this increased regulation could require bd or sterilization service providers including providers used by bd to temporarily suspend operations to install additional air quality controls limit the use of ethylene oxide or take other actions which would further reduce the available capacity of thirdparty providers to sterilize medical devices and health care products a few states have filed lawsuits to require additional air quality controls and expand limitations on the use of ethylene oxide at sterilization facilities in december 2020 the state of new mexico filed a lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary and permanent injunction against a major medical device sterilizer which sterilizes certain of our surgery products to reduce ethylene oxide emissions associated with their sterilization process on the federal level in late 2019 the us environmental protection agency provided notice that it would be conducting rulemaking to reconsider federal regulations applicable to the use and emission of ethylene oxide if any such proceedings or rulemaking result in the suspension of sterilization operations at bd or at medical device sterilizers used by bd or otherwise limit the availability of thirdparty sterilization capacity this could interrupt or otherwise adversely impact production of certain of our products bd has business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of any such disruptions although these plans may not be able to fully offset such impact for the reasons noted above

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the material risks that could adversely affect bd’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows we may also be adversely impacted by other risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

business economic and industry risks 

we are subject to risks associated with public health threats including the covid19 pandemic which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business the nature and extent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

we are subject to risks associated with public health threats including epidemics and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic the outbreak of covid19 in 2020 and the travel restrictions quarantines and other actions taken by governments and the private sector to slow the spread of the virus resulted in a global economic slowdown and caused healthcare systems to divert resources to manage the pandemic these measures led to unprecedented restrictions on and disruptions in businesses and personal activities as a result we experienced significant reductions in the demand for certain of our products due to reductions in elective and nonessential procedures lower utilization of routine testing and related specimen collection reduced capital spend by customers and a decrease in research activity due to laboratory closures and reduced clinical testing any resurgences in covid19 infections or new strains of the virus could result in the imposition of new governmental lockdowns quarantine requirements or other restrictions to slow the spread of the virus or the deferral of elective medical procedures which could weaken demand for certain of our products these measures could include determinations that our or our suppliers’ facilities are not essential businesses that could result in closures or other restrictions that significantly disrupt our operations or those of distributors or suppliers in our supply chain while covid19 case volumes have decreased in the us and certain other countries the global outlook remains uncertain as case counts fluctuate and vaccination rates remain relatively low in many parts of the world going forward medical procedure rates may vary by country based on regional covid19 infection and vaccination rates hospital occupancy and staffing levels transportation limitations quarantines and other restrictions and the emergence of new covid19 variants 

in addition the covid19 pandemic has impacted our global supply chain network and we may experience disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components used in our products we have experienced and may continue to experience significant challenges to our global transportation channels and other aspects of the global supply chain network including to the cost and availability of raw materials and components due to shortages and resulting cost inflation any such delays or shortages may result in our inability to meet customer demand for our products and as covid19 conditions improve there may be unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products which may pose challenges to our supply chain and could adversely affect our business while utilization rates for most of our products have largely recovered to prepandemic levels future deferrals of elective medical procedures andor the imposition of new governmental restrictions due to resurgences in covid19 infections or new strains of the virus may weaken demand for certain of our products andor disrupt our operations in addition in response to the pandemic we developed and launched multiple products for the detection and identification of covid19 including tests for our bd max™ molecular system and bd veritor™ plus system and there are a number of factors including the rate of vaccination and the availability of competitive products that could impact the level of demand and pricing for our covid19 diagnostics testing 

additionally on september 9 2021 president biden issued an executive order requiring all employers with us government contracts to require that their usbased employees contractors and certain subcontractors that work on or in support of us government contracts are fully vaccinated as set forth in the executive order except for any employees with a medical or religious exemption as a us government contractor we are required to comply with the executive order the implementation of these requirements may result in employee attrition which could be material as a substantial number of our manufacturing and distribution center employees are based in areas of the country where vaccination rates are below the national average if we were to lose employees it may be difficult or very costly in the current competitive labor market 

to find and recruit replacement employees and this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition furthermore on september 9 2021 president biden announced that he has directed the department of labors occupational safety and health administration “osha” to develop an emergency temporary standard “ets” mandating either the full vaccination or weekly testing of employees for employers with 100 or more employees on november 4 2021 osha issued the ets which requires employers with 100 or more employees to develop implement and enforce a mandatory covid19 vaccination policy unless they adopt a policy requiring employees to choose to either be vaccinated or undergo regular covid19 testing and wear a face covering at work the ets and the executive order are effective as of january 4 2022 on november 12 2021 the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit granted a motion to stay osha’s ets and ordered that osha take no further steps to implement or enforce the ets until a further court order due to the pending litigation osha has suspended activities related to the implementation and enforcement of the ets pending future developments it is currently not possible to predict with certainty the impact the executive order or osha’s ets will have on our workforce additional vaccine mandates may also be implemented in other jurisdictions in which we operate 

the scope and duration of the pandemic including future resurgences globally the pace at which government restrictions are lifted or whether additional actions may be taken to contain the virus the global vaccination rate the speed and extent to which global markets and utilization rates for our products fully recover from the disruptions caused by the pandemic and the impact of these factors on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence 

to the extent covid19 adversely affects our operations and global economic conditions more generally it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein 

a downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our operations 

deterioration in the domestic or international economic environment particularly in emerging markets and countries with governmentsponsored healthcare systems may cause decreased demand for our products and services and increased competition which could result in lower sales volume and lower prices for our products longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply we have previously experienced delays in collecting government receivables in certain countries in western europe due to economic conditions and we may experience similar delays in the future in these and other countries or regions experiencing financial problems 

the medical technology industry is very competitive 

we are a global company that faces significant competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies with multiple product lines some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do as well as firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines nontraditional entrants such as technology companies are also entering into the healthcare industry some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we face competition across all our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features clinical or economic outcomes product quality availability price services and other factors our ability to compete is also impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements such as increased demand for more environmentallyfriendly products and for products incorporating digital capabilities as well as changes in the ways health care services are delivered including the transition of more care from acute to nonacute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs improve clinical results and expand patient access our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we meet these changing market demands in terms of our product offerings and marketing approaches 

the medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change and discovery and frequent product introductions the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology that provide better features pricing clinical outcomes or 

economic value may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device lower cost producers have also created pricing pressure particularly in developing markets 

the medical technology industry has also experienced a significant amount of consolidation resulting in companies with greater scale and market presence than bd traditional distributors are also manufacturers of medical devices providing another source of competition in addition health care systems and other providers are consolidating resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies as a result competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the demand for and prices of our products 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

a substantial amount of our revenues are derived from international operations and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the us in the future the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 7 management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks 

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers or other cost containment measures could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities including medicare medicaid and comparable foreign programs and private insurers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources and by country may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction reimbursement rates can also affect the market acceptance rate of new technologies and products reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states or abroad changes in coverage or reimbursement rates by private payers or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business 

initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs in the us and other countries where we do business may also put pressure on medical device pricing in the us these include among others valuebased purchasing and managed care arrangements governments in china and other countries are also using various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures including increased use of competitive bidding and tenders and price regulation 

our future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development new product development requires significant investment in rd clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products and technologies successfully complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and 

abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 

our international operations subject us to certain business risks 

a substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the united states and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets especially in emerging markets our foreign operations subject us to certain risks relating to among other things fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above local political conditions general economic conditions such as inflation deflation interest rate volatility and credit availability competition from local companies increases in trade protectionism us relations with the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements changes in local health care payment systems and health care delivery systems local product preferences and requirements longer payment terms for account receivables than we experience in the us difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations changes to international trade agreements and treaties changes in tax laws weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries and import or export licensing requirements the success of our operations outside the united states also depends in part on our ability to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and sales and distribution networks these and other factors may adversely impact our ability to pursue our growth strategy in these markets 

in addition our international operations are governed by the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws outside the us global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more enforcement proceedings by us and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties while we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws our international operations which often involve customer relationships with foreign governments create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees consultants sales agents or distributors any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations and significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities and negatively affect our reputation 

changes in us policy regarding international trade including import and export regulation and international trade agreements could also negatively impact our business the us has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from china and certain other countries which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries additional tariffs imposed by the us on a broader range of imports or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we may not be able to offset or that otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our business 

we sell products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and agencies in other countries the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable for instance there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods the availability of governmental research funding may be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 

we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 

our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense additionally we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical manufacturing and distribution experience to operate our business successfully our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment from time to time there may be shortages of skilled labor which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees or lead to increased labor costs if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected 

for a further discussion of risks related to the biden administration vaccine mandates see the abovereferenced risk factor “we are subject to risks associated with public health threats including the covid19 pandemic which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business the nature and extent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable” 

operational risks 

breaches of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we rely on information systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations including sensitive personal or proprietary information in addition some of our products include information systems that collect data regarding patients and patient therapy on behalf of our customers and some connect to our systems for maintenance purposes our information systems have been subjected to attack via malicious code execution and cyber or phishing attacks and we have experienced instances of unauthorized access to our systems in the past and expect to be subject to similar cyberattacks in the future in addition to our own information in the course of doing business we sometimes store information with third parties that could be subject to attacks 

cyberattacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being accessed destroyed or stolen which could adversely affect our competitive position in the market likewise we could suffer disruption of our operations and other significant negative consequences including increased costs for security measures or remediation diversion of management attention litigation and damage to our relationships with vendors business partners and customers unauthorized tampering adulteration or interference with our products may also create issues with product functionality that could result in a loss of data risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions cyberattacks could result in unauthorized access to our systems and products which could also impact our compliance with privacy and other laws and regulations and could result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation while we will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and products and work with government authorities and thirdparty providers to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated frequent and adaptive there can be no assurances that these protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a material adverse impact on our business 

cost volatility could adversely affect our operations  

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials components freight and energy that in turn increases the costs of producing and distributing our products new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy and transportation costs as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components in particular we purchase supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products and any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results increases in oil prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs recently the costs of raw materials transportation construction services and energy necessary for the production and distribution of our products have increased significantly while we have implemented cost containment measures selective price increases and taken other actions to offset these inflationary pressures in our supply chain we may not be able to completely offset all the increases in our operational costs 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components could adversely affect our operating results 

we purchase many different types of raw materials and components used in our products certain raw materials and components are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons certain raw materials and components are purchased from sole suppliers the price and supply of these materials and components may be impacted or disrupted for reasons beyond our control including supplier shutdowns transportation delays inflationary pricing pressures work stoppages labor shortages and governmental regulatory actions we have experienced and may continue to experience significant challenges to our global transportation channels and other aspects of the global supply chain network including to the cost and availability of raw materials and components due to shortages and resulting cost inflation the us and other governments may enact or use laws and regulations such as the defense production act or export restrictions to ensure availability of needed covid19 testing and vaccination delivery devices any such action may impact our global supply chain network while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply and service no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

interruption of our manufacturing or sterilization operations could adversely affect our business 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants interruption to our manufacturing operations resulting from weather or natural disasters regulatory requirements or issues in our manufacturing process equipment failure or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in some instances we may not be able to transition manufacturing to other bd sites or a third party to replace the lost production a significant interruption of our manufacturing operations could result in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers 

in addition many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize both bd facilities and thirdparties for this process in some instances only a few facilities are qualified under applicable regulations to conduct this sterilization to the extent we or thirdparties are unable to sterilize our products whether due to lack of capacity regulatory requirements or otherwise we may be unable to transition sterilization to other sites or modalities in a timely or cost effective manner or at all which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

at a broader level several states have increased the regulatory requirements associated with the use and emission of ethylene oxide for sterilization this increased regulation could require bd or sterilization service providers including providers used by bd to temporarily suspend operations limit the use of ethylene oxide or take other actions which would further reduce the available capacity of thirdparty providers to sterilize medical devices and health care products federal agencies may also regulate the use and emission of ethylene oxide if any such regulatory actions or rulemaking result in the suspension of sterilization operations at bd or at medical device sterilizers used by bd or otherwise limit the availability of thirdparty sterilization capacity this could interrupt or otherwise adversely impact production of certain of our products see “item 1 business  regulation” for a discussion of the consent order bd entered into with the environmental protection division of the georgia department of natural resources 

our business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change 

the longterm effects of global climate change present risks to our business extreme weather or other conditions caused by climate change could adversely impact our supply chain and the availability and cost of raw materials and components required for the operation of our business such conditions could also result in physical damage to products plants and distribution centers as well as the infrastructure and facilities of 

hospitals medical care facilities and other customers in addition regulations intended to limit greenhouse gas emissions such as taxes on fuel and energy to mitigate the impacts of climate change may increase which could increase our operating costs and the costs charged by suppliers these events could adversely affect our operations and our financial performance 

legal quality and regulatory risks 

we are subject to lawsuits 

we are or have been a defendant in a number of lawsuits including among others purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and violations of federal securities laws product liability claims which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multidistrict litigation proceedings including pending claims relating to our hernia repair implant products surgical continence and pelvic organ prolapse products for women and vena cava filter products and suits alleging patent infringement we have also been subject to government subpoenas and civil investigative demands seeking information with respect to alleged violations of law including in connection with federal andor state healthcare programs such as medicare or medicaid federal contracting requirements andor sales and marketing practices a more detailed description of certain litigation to which we are a party is contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we could be subject to additional lawsuits governmental investigations subpoenas and civil investigative demands in the future any such lawsuits governmental investigations subpoenas and civil investigative demands could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could distract management from the operations of the business 

reserves established for estimated losses with respect to legal proceedings do not represent an exact calculation of our actual liability but instead represent our estimate of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and our underlying loss reserve estimates additional reserves may be established or current reserves may be significantly increased from timetotime also in some instances we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges materially in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor liquidity 

with respect to certain litigation we believe that some settlements and judgments as well as legal defense costs may be covered in whole or in part under applicable insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies or in some circumstances indemnification obligations owed to us by other parties however amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages andor costs in addition there is no guarantee that insurers or other parties will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available also for certain product liability claims or lawsuits bd does not maintain or has limited remaining insurance coverage and we may not be able to obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms or at all that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 

we are subject to extensive regulation 

our operations are global and are affected by complex state federal and international laws relating to healthcare environmental protection antitrust anticorruption marketing fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws export control product safety and efficacy employment privacy and other areas violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and in some cases exclusion from participation in health care programs such as medicare and medicaid environmental laws particularly with respect to climate change and the emission of greenhouse gases are also becoming more stringent throughout the world which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate closures of or changes to our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers or result in liability to bd the enactment of 

additional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations and financial performance 

we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of our products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may require us to incur significant costs in terms of time and resources and these costs have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda and comparable governing bodies for supporting data for submissions the regulatory process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of our products governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration including but not limited to labeling or prohibited materials that require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries 

following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting and other post market requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production marketing or sale of our products and result in delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances warning letters or consent decrees closure of manufacturing sites import bans seizures or recalls of products civil or criminal sanctions and damage to our reputation more stringent oversight by the fda and other agencies in recent years has resulted in increased enforcement activity which increases our compliance risk 

we are operating under a consent decree with the fda entered into by carefusion in 2007 and amended in 2009 that affects our alaris™ infusion pump business in the united states we are also currently operating under a warning letter issued by the fda for more information regarding the consent decree and warning letter see “regulation” under item 1 business 

as previously disclosed we are undertaking certain remediation of our bd alaris system and are currently shipping the product in the us only in cases of medical necessity and to remediate recalled software versions we will not be able to fully resume commercial operations for the bd alaris system in the us until a 510k submission relating to the product has been cleared by the fda no assurance can be given as to when or if clearance will be obtained from the fda 

in addition the european union “eu” has adopted the eu medical device regulation the “eu mdr” and the in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices including in the area of clinical evidence requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance effective may 2021 manufacturers of currently approved medical devices must meet the requirements of the eu mdr for selfcertified devices and have until may 2024 to meet the requirements for medical devices with a valid conformity assessment certificate manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic medical devices have until may 2022 to meet the eu ivdr complying with and maintaining devices under these regulations requires us to incur significant expenditures failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to eu conformity requirements 

we are also subject to complex and frequently changing privacy and data protection laws rules and regulations in the us as well as in all other regions where bd operates regarding the collection use storage transfer and other processing of personal information any actual or perceived noncompliance with these laws rules and regulations could result in significant consequences for bd including among other things business interruption sanctions and significant pecuniary fines regulatory inquiries and investigations adverse publicity loss of competitive advantage and customer trust as well as privacy litigation and civil lawsuits with damages 

the importance of privacy laws rules and regulations for the healthcare and medtech industry is constantly growing since personal data has become an integral part of doing business in our sector and the legal climate norms around data sharing and the definition of meaningful privacy are evolving and becoming more complex worldwide 

for instance the european general data protection regulation the “gdpr” applicable as of 2018 and still one of the strictest and most comprehensive privacy laws in the world is being continuously enforced 

and increasingly heavy fines are now being levied on businesses fines for noncompliance with the gdpr can amount to up to €20 million or 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover from the preceding financial year whichever is higher and may be imposed in conjunction with the exercise of the authority’s investigatory and corrective powers the gdpr’s extraterritorial scope makes it applicable to our usbased legal entities whenever our business activities systems and products process the personal data of eu residents 

privacy laws rules and regulations are also rapidly developing in other regions several states in the us have introduced dedicated privacy laws eg california and virginia or have draft privacy laws in the pipeline and new privacy and data protection laws have come into effect in relevant countries like china brazil india and south korea these laws impact bd businesses to the extent they rely on the use of personal data and pose the challenge of how to cope with a heterogeneous patchwork of laws rules regulations and industry standards while maintaining our global reach 

defects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects component failures unapproved or improper use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or as required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers enforcement actions andor investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of postmarket approval requirements 

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 

many of our businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property assets these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position in addition competitors may seek to invalidate patents on our products or claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property which could result in a loss of competitive advantage or the payment of significant legal fees damage awards and past or future royalties as well as injunctions against future sales of our products we also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the us which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

we may not be able to service all of our indebtedness 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments however our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations of the combined company and to utilize other methods to make scheduled payments will depend on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control there can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures seek additional capital sell assets or refinance our indebtedness any such action may not be successful and we may be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to among other things have liens on our property andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person engage in certain transactions with affiliates and change the nature of our business in addition the agreements also require us to comply with certain financial covenants including financial ratios our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations 

risks relating to the proposed spinoff of the diabetes care business 

risks relating to proposed spinoff 

on may 6 2021 we announced our intention to spin off our diabetes care business as a separate publicly traded company to bd’s shareholders the proposed spinoff is intended to be a taxfree transaction for us federal income tax purposes and is expected to be completed in the first half of calendar year 2022 subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including final approval by bd’s board of directors and the effectiveness of a registration statement on form 10 filed with the sec 

executing the proposed spinoff will require significant time and attention from bd’s senior management and employees which could disrupt bd’s ongoing business and adversely affect financial results and results of operations the proposed spinoff is also complex and completion of the proposed spinoff and the timing of its completion will be subject to a number of factors and conditions including the readiness of the new company to operate as an independent public company and finalization of the capital structure of the new company unanticipated developments could delay prevent or otherwise adversely affect the proposed spinoff including but not limited to disruptions in general or financial market conditions material adverse changes in business or industry conditions unanticipated costs and potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or clearances there can be no assurances that bd will be able to complete the proposed spinoff on the terms or on the timeline that was announced if at all in addition if the spinoff is completed the company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the spinoff further there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of bd’s common stock would have been had the proposed spinoff not occurred 

general business risks 

we cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

we seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky and the integration of any newlyacquired business requires significant effort and management attention the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 

natural disasters war and other events could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

natural disasters including the impacts of climate change hurricanes tornadoes windstorms fires earthquakes and floods and other extreme weather events global health pandemics war terrorism labor 

disruptions and international conflicts and actions taken by the united states and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and areas outside of the united states in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers

bd’s intention to spin off diabetes care 

on may 6 2021 we announced our intention to spin off our diabetes care business as a separate publicly traded company to bd’s shareholders the proposed spinoff is intended to be a taxfree transaction for us federal income tax purposes and is expected to be completed in the first half of calendar year 2022 subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including final approval from bd’s board of directors and the effectiveness of a registration statement on form 10 the company believes that as an independent publicly traded entity the diabetes care business will be positioned to more effectively allocate its capital and operational resources with a dedicated growth strategy for further discussion of risks relating to the proposed spinoff of our diabetes care business see item 1a risk factors—risks relating to the proposed spinoff of the diabetes care business 

covid19 pandemic impacts and response 

a novel strain of coronavirus disease “covid19” was officially declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 and governments around the world have been implementing various measures to slow and control the ongoing spread of covid19 these government measures as well as a shift in healthcare priorities resulted in a significant decline in medical procedures in our fiscal year 2020 demand for our products showed substantial recovery in our fiscal year 2021 however regional resurgences in covid19 infections and the emergence of the delta variant continued to impact the demand for certain of our products in our fiscal year 2021 our 2021 revenues reflected a substantial benefit from sales related to covid19 diagnostic testing on the bd veritor tm plus and bd max tm systems the factors that affected our revenue growth in fiscal year 2021 including those related to the covid19 pandemic are discussed in greater detail further below 

due to the significant uncertainty that exists relative to the duration and overall impact of the covid19 pandemic our future operating performance particularly in the shortterm may be subject to volatility while nonacute utilization rates for most of our products have largely recovered to prepandemic levels resurgences in covid19 infections or new strains of the virus may weaken future demand for certain of our products andor disrupt our operations we also continue to see challenges posed by the pandemic to global transportation channels and other aspects of our supply chain including the cost and availability of raw materials as well as logistical challenges affecting the movement of freight around the globe the united states and other governments may enact or use laws and regulations such as the defense production act or export restrictions to ensure availability of needed covid19 testing and vaccination delivery devices any such action may impact our global supply chain network 

the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows is dependent on certain factors including 

• the extent to which resurgences in covid19 infections or new strains of the virus including the delta variant result in future deferrals of elective medical procedures andor the extent to which the imposition of new governmental lockdowns quarantine requirements or other restrictions may weaken demand for certain of our products andor disrupt our operations 

• the degree to which demand and pricing for our covid19 diagnostics testing solutions continues to be impacted by reduced infection rates as well as by distribution and utilization of available covid19 vaccines and the availability of competitive sarscov2 diagnostic testing products which we expect will result in lower covid19 testing revenues in future periods 

• the degree to which the pandemic has escalated challenges that existed for global healthcare systems prior to the pandemic such as staffing shortages including nursing shortages and budget constraints 

• the continued momentum of the global economy’s recovery from the pandemic and the degree of pressure that a weakened macroeconomic environment would put on future healthcare utilization and the global demand for our products 

we remain focused on partnering with governments healthcare systems and healthcare professionals to navigate the covid19 pandemic this focus includes providing access to our sarscov2 diagnostics tests and injection devices for global vaccination campaigns as well as supplying products and solutions for ongoing care for patients around the world we have also remained focused on protecting the health and safety of bd employees while ensuring continued availability of bd’s critical medical devices and technologies during these unprecedented times 

summary of financial results 

worldwide revenues in 2021 of 20248 billion increased 183 from the prioryear period which primarily reflected an increase in volume including increases attributable to our core products of approximately 153 revenues in 2021 also reflected a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 27 as well as a favorable impact from price of approximately 03 

volume in 2021 reflected increased demand for our broad portfolio of products and was driven by the following 

• the medical segment’s revenues in 2021 reflected increased demand in the medication delivery solutions pharmaceutical systems and diabetes care units which was partially offset by a decline in the medication management solutions unit 

• the life sciences segment’s revenues in 2021 reflected growth in both units growth in the integrated diagnostic solutions unit included approximately 2 billion of revenues driven by covid19 diagnostic testing primarily on the bd veritor tm plus and bd max tm systems 

• interventional segment revenues in 2021 reflected increased demand in all three units as hospital utilization increased and new product offerings drove higher sales 

we continue to invest in research and development geographic expansion and new product programs to drive further revenue and profit growth we have reinvested over 200 million of the profits from our sales related to covid19 diagnostic testing into our bd 2025 strategy our ability to sustain our longterm growth will depend on a number of factors including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion develop innovative new products and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness as discussed above current global economic conditions remain relatively volatile due to the covid19 pandemic in addition an inability to increase or maintain selling prices globally could adversely impact our businesses also we are experiencing challenges related to global transportation channels and supply chains these challenges have subjected certain of our costs specifically raw material and freight costs to inflationary pressures which have unfavorably impacted our gross profit and operating margins additional 

discussion regarding the impacts of these inflationary pressures on our operating results in 2021 is provided further below 

our financial position remains strong with cash flows from operating activities totaling 4647 billion in 2021 at september 30 2021 we had 2403 billion in cash and equivalents and shortterm investments including restricted cash we continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends during fiscal year 2021 we paid cash dividends of 1048 billion including 958 million paid to common shareholders and 90 million paid to preferred shareholders we also repurchased approximately 1750 billion of our common stock during fiscal year 2021 

each reporting period we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period a weaker us dollar compared to the prioryear period resulted in a favorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenues and an unfavorable impact to our expenses during 2021 we evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currencyneutral basis which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currencyneutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods foreign currencyneutral fxn information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a foreign currencyneutral basis as one measure to evaluate our performance we calculate foreign currencyneutral percentages by converting our currentperiod local currency financial results using the priorperiod foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our currentperiod results these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap results on a foreign currencyneutral basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap

net income and diluted earnings per share in 2021 2020 and 2019 were as follows 



financial instrument market risk 

we selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations the counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign exchange risk 

bd and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout europe greater asia canada and latin america we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency these payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions we hedge substantially all such exposures primarily through the use of forward contracts we have also hedged the currency exposure associated with investments in certain foreign subsidiaries with instruments such as foreign currencydenominated debt and crosscurrency swaps which are designated as net investment hedges as well as currency exchange contracts we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations including sales to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period we did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against these foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2021 or 2020 

derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value for foreign currency derivatives market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities 

with respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2021 and 2020 the impact that changes in the us dollar would have on pretax earnings was estimated as follows 



these calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments 

interest rate risk 

when managing interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments we may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interestbearing investments in tandem since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure for interest rate derivative instruments fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using marketbased observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities 

the impact that changes in interest rates would have on interest rate derivatives outstanding at september 30 2021 and 2020 as well as the effect that changes in interest rates would have on our earnings or cash flows over a oneyear period based upon our overall interest rate exposure were estimated as follows

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 the company refinanced its fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was to expire in december 2022 with a new fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in september 2026 the credit facility provides borrowings of up to 275 billion with separate sublimits of 100 million for letters of credit and swingline loans the expiration date of the credit facility may be extended for up to two additional one year periods subject to certain restrictions including the consent of the lenders the credit facility provides that we may subject to additional commitments by lenders request an additional 500 million of financing for a maximum aggregate commitment under the credit facility of up to 325 billion proceeds from this facility may be used for general corporate purposes there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at september 30 2021 

the agreement for our revolving credit facility contains the following financial covenants we were in compliance with these covenants as applicable as of september 30 2021 

• we are required to have a leverage coverage ratio of no more than 

◦ 425to1 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter following the closing of the credit facility or 

◦ 475to1 for the four full fiscal quarters following the consummation of a material acquisition 

we also have informal lines of credit outside the united states we may from time to time access the commercial paper market as we manage working capital over the normal course of our business activities we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of september 30 2021 also over the normal course of our business activities we transfer certain trade receivable assets to third parties under factoring agreements additional disclosures regarding sales of trade receivable assets are provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

access to capital and credit ratings 

our corporate credit ratings with the rating agencies standard  poors ratings services “sp” moodys investor service “moodys” and fitch ratings “fitch” were as follows at september 30 2021 



in january 2021 sp affirmed our september 30 2020 ratings and revised the agencys outlook on our ratings to stable from negative also in january 2021 moodys upgraded our senior unsecured rating to baa3 from ba1 as well as our commercial paper rating to p3 from np moody’s also affirmed its positive outlook on our ratings in may 2021 fitch affirmed our september 30 2020 rating and revised its outlook on our ratings from stable to positive 

lower corporate debt ratings and downgrades of our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing we believe that given our debt ratings our financial management policies our ability to generate cash flow and the noncyclical geographically diversified nature of our businesses we would have access to additional shortterm and longterm capital should the need arise a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change 

contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future information regarding our obligations under purchase debt and lease arrangements are provided in notes 5 15 and 17 respectively to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

critical accounting policies 

the following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold which is generally upon shipment or delivery depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement 

revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex and therefore significantly affects the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the product are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed for certain service arrangements including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term the majority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain instruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period 

our agreements with customers within certain organizational units including medication management solutions integrated diagnostic solutions and biosciences contain multiple performance obligations including both products and certain services noted above determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require judgment the transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price standalone selling price is the amount at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer we generally estimate standalone selling prices using list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers the use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral 

our gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions which include rebates and sales discounts these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and judgment is required when determining the impact on gross revenues for a reporting period additional factors considered in the estimate of our rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to our distributors as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates 

impairment of assets 

goodwill assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with finite lives including developed technology and other longlived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units generally represent one level below reporting segments our review of goodwill for each reporting unit compares the fair value of the reporting unit estimated using an income approach with its carrying value our annual goodwill impairment test performed on july 1 2021 did not result in any impairment charges as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

we generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures the value of our income producing assets this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use appropriate discount rates terminal values and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with bd’s business plans the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset actual results may differ from management’s estimates 

income taxes 

bd maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 

bd conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we 

record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions our past audit experience with similar situations and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters bd’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if upon resolution with taxing authorities we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

we have reviewed our needs in the united states for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and we continue to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the united states to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property plant and equipment expenditure needs as a result we are permanently reinvested with respect to all of our historical foreign earnings as of september 30 2021 additional disclosures regarding our accounting for income taxes are provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

contingencies 

we are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including without limitation product liability and environmental matters as further discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses we establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries a determination of the amount of accruals for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual matter when appropriate the accrual is developed with the consultation of outside counsel and as in the case of certain mass tort litigation the expertise of an actuarial specialist regarding the nature timing and extent of each matter the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our litigation strategy we record expected recoveries from product liability insurance carriers or other parties when realization of recovery is deemed probable 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows 

benefit plans 

we have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations that are measured using actuarial valuations which include assumptions for the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

the discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date september 30 specifically for the us pension plan we will use a discount rate of 289 for 2022 which was based on an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date to calculate the pension expense in 2022 we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2022 are provided in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption although reviewed each year changes less frequently due to the longterm nature of the assumption this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date rather it is used only in the calculation of pension expense to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider many factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results benchmark data expected returns on various plan asset 

classes as well as current and expected asset allocations we will use a longterm expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 625 for the us pension plan in 2022 we believe our discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our us pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows 

• discount rate — a change of plus minus 25 basis points with other assumptions held constant would have an estimated 6 million favorable unfavorable impact on the total us net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan costs this estimate assumes no change in the shape or steepness of the companyspecific yield curve used to plot the individual spot rates that will be applied to the future cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost 

• expected return on plan assets — a change of plus minus 25 basis points with other assumptions held constant would have an estimated 5 million favorable unfavorable impact on us pension plan costs

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment in addition the entry into the market of lowcost manufacturers has created increased pricing pressures bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement in support of its core strategies see further discussion of the risks relating to competition in the medical technology industry in item 1a risk factors 

thirdparty reimbursement 

reimbursement is an important strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical technology obtaining coverage coding and payment is critical to the commercial success of a new product or procedure difficulty in achieving market access can lead to slow adoption in the marketplace and inadequate payment levels that can continue for months or even years 

a majority of bd’s customers rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures products and services they provide vertical integration has created a very concentrated market among commercial thirdparty payers in the us global payers are increasingly focused on strategies to control spending on healthcare and reward improvements in quality and patient outcomes 

bd is actively engaged in identifying and communicating value propositions of its products for payer provider and patient stakeholders and it employs various efforts and resources to attempt to positively impact coverage coding and payment pathways however bd has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and payment levels for bd products the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer’s discretion as bd’s product offerings are diverse across a variety of healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment pathways that impact the decisions of healthcare providers regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products therefore changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products in any given country for any given product 

as government programs expand healthcare coverage for their citizens they have at the same time sought to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures products or services in addition most payers are seeking price predictability in order to mitigate future exposure to manufacturer price increases this is coupled with an increase in high deductible private insurance plans which transfer more pricing exposure and burden directly to the patient 

many payers both in the us and globally have developed specific payment and delivery mechanisms to support these cost control efforts and to focus on paying for value these mechanisms include payment reductions pay for performance measures qualitybased performance payments restrictive coverage policies bidding and tender mechanics studies to compare the effectiveness of therapies and use of technology 

assessments these changes whether the result of legislation new strategic alliances or market consolidations have created an increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective and qualitydriven healthcare 

for example as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” the us has implemented valuebased payment methodologies and has created alternative payment models such as bundled payments to continue to drive improved value we see other governments around the world considering similar bundling reform measures with the utilization of the diagnosis related gro up “drg” as a payment mechanism to drive toward quality and resource based reimbursement becoming more common in regions outside the us 

regulation 

general 

bds operations are global and are affected by complex state federal and international laws relating to healthcare environmental protection antitrust anticorruption marketing fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws export control product safety and efficacy employment privacy and other areas 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

bd actively maintains fdaiso quality systems that establish standards for its product design manufacturing and distribution processes prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of bd’s quality systems as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials these regulatory controls as well as any changes in agency policies can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new and existing products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

bd also is subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the united states concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws global anticorruption transportation safety and health and customs and exports many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years this is part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the united states 

in addition as part of ppaca the federal government has enacted the sunshine act provisions requiring bd to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals countries outside the united states have enacted similar local laws requiring medical device companies to report transfers of value to health care providers licensed in those countries failure to comply with these laws could result in a range of fines penalties andor other sanctions 

consent decree with fda 

our infusion pump organizational unit is operating under an amended consent decree entered into by carefusion with the fda in 2007 carefusion’s consent decree with the fda is related to its alaris™ se infusion pumps in february 2009 carefusion and the fda amended the consent decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for carefusion 303 inc the organizational unit that manufactures and sells bd alaris infusion pumps in the united states the amended consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories 

while this bd organizational unit remains subject to the amended consent decree which includes the requirements of the original consent decree it has made substantial progress in its compliance efforts however we cannot predict the outcome of this matter and the amended consent decree authorizes the fda in the event of any violations in the future to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing infusion pumps recall products and take other actions we may be required to pay damages of 15000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree up to 15 million per year 

we also cannot currently predict whether additional monetary investment will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matter’s ultimate impact on our business we may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because among other things the fda may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree andor we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree as of september 30 2020 we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the amended consent decree and accordingly we have no accruals associated with compliance with the amended consent decree 

we are undertaking certain remediation of our bd alaris system and are currently shipping the product in the us only in cases of medical necessity we will not be able to fully resume commercial operations for the bd alaris system in the us until a 510k submission relating to the product has been filed with and subsequently cleared by the fda 

following an inspection that began in march 2020 of our medication management systems facility carefusion 303 inc in san diego california the fda issued to bd a form 483 notice that contains a number of observations of nonconformance bd has provided the fda with its response to the form 483 and has begun to implement certain corrective actions to address the observations however the fda’s review of the items raised in the form 483 remains ongoing and no assurances can be given regarding further action by the fda as a result of the observations 

fda warning letter 

on january 11 2018 bd received a warning letter from the fda with respect to our bd preanalytical systems pas unit citing certain alleged violations of quality system regulations and of law the warning letter states that until bd resolves the outstanding issues covered by the warning letter the fda will not clear or approve any premarket submissions for class iii devices to which the nonconformances are reasonably related or grant requests for certificates to foreign governments bd has worked closely with the fda and implemented corrective actions to address the concerns identified in the warning letter in march 2020 the fda conducted a subsequent inspection of pas which it classified as voluntary action indicated which means the fda will not take or recommend any administrative or regulatory action as a result of the unit’s response to the observations in the inspection 

consent order  covington georgia 

on october 28 2019 bd entered into a consent order with the environmental protection division of the georgia department of natural resources the “epd” following the filing of a complaint and motion for temporary restraining order by the epd seeking to enjoin bd from continuing sterilization operations at its covington georgia facility under the terms of the consent order which has been amended two times upon mutual agreement of bd and epd bd voluntarily agreed to a nu mber of operational changes at its covington and madison georgia facilities designed to further reduce ethylene oxide emissions including but not limited to operating at a reduced capacity bd does not believe that the consent order will have a material impact on its operations violation of the consent order though could subject us to additional restrictions on the sterilization operations at our covington and madison facilities bd has business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of any additional restrictions on our operations at these facilities although it is possible that these plans will not be able to fully offset such impact

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the material risks that could adversely affect bd’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows we may also be adversely impacted by other risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

business economic and industry risks 

we are subject to risks associated with public health threats including the ongoing covid19 pandemic which has had and we expect will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business the nature and extent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable 

we are subject to risks associated with public health threats including the covid19 pandemic the outbreak of covid19 and the travel restrictions quarantines and other actions taken by governments and the private sector to slow the spread of the virus resulted in a global economic slowdown and caused healthcare systems to divert resources to manage the pandemic these measures led to unprecedented restrictions on and disruptions in businesses and personal activities as a result we experienced significant reductions in the demand for certain of our products resulting from reductions in elective and nonessential procedures lower utilization of routine testing and related specimen collection reduced capital spend by customers and a decrease in research activity due to laboratory closures and reduced clinical testing 

while the united states and other countries have begun to reopen their economies utilization rates for many of our products have not returned to prepandemic levels there may also be continued pressure on our margins due to manufacturing variances resulting from lower demand for certain of our products in addition in response to the pandemic we developed and launched multiple products for the detection and identification of covid19 including tests for our bd max™ molecular system and bd veritor™ plus system and there are a number of factors including the timing and availability of any covid19 vaccine and the entry of additional competitive products that could impact the level of demand and pricing for our covid19 diagnostics testing 

moreover any resurgence in covid19 infections could result in the imposition of new governmental lockdowns quarantine requirements or other restrictions to slow the spread of the virus which could weaken demand for certain of our products as discussed above such measures have begun to be implemented again in certain european countries and in the united states as infections have begun to increase again in some cases 

significantly these measures could include determinations that our or our suppliers’ facilities are not essential businesses that could result in closures or other restrictions that significantly disrupt our operations or those of distributors or suppliers in our supply chain in addition while we undertook certain financing activities as a precautionary measure during this economic slowdown no assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets in the future without incurring significant costs and expense 

the scope and duration of the pandemic including the current resurgences in various regions around the world and other future resurgences the pace at which government restrictions are lifted or whether additional actions may be taken to contain the v irus the speed and extent to which global markets and utilization rates for our products fully recover from the disruptions caused by the pandemic and the impact of these factors on our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence 

to the extent covid19 adversely affects our operations and global economic conditions more generally it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein 

a downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our operations 

deterioration in the domestic or international economic environment particularly in emerging markets and countries with governmentsponsored healthcare systems may cause decreased demand for our products and services and increased competition which could result in lower sales volume and lower prices for our products longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply we have previously experienced delays in collecting government receivables in certain countries in western europe due to economic conditions and we may experience similar delays in the future in these and other countries or regions experiencing financial problems 

the medical technology industry is very competitive 

we are a global company that faces significant competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies with multiple product lines some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do as well as firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines nontraditional entrants such as technology companies are also entering into the healthcare industry some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we face competition across all our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features clinical or economic outcomes product quality availability price services and other factors our ability to compete is also impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements such as increased demand for more environmentallyfriendly products and for products incorporating digital capabilities as well as changes in the ways health care services are delivered including the transition of more care from acute to nonacute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs improve clinical results and expand patient access our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we meet these changing market demands in terms of our product offerings and marketing approaches 

the medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change and discovery and frequent product introductions the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology that provide better features pricing clinical outcomes or economic value may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device lower cost producers have also created pricing pressure particularly in developing markets 

the medical technology industry has also experienced a significant amount of consolidation resulting in companies with greater scale and market presence than bd traditional distributors are also manufacturers of medical devices providing another source of competition in addition health care systems and other providers are consolidating resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies as a result competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers 

which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the demand for and prices of our products 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

a substantial amount of our revenues are derived from international operations and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the us in the future the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 7 management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks 

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers or other cost containment measures could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities including medicare medicaid and comparable foreign programs and private insurers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources and by country may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction reimbursement rates can also affect the market acceptance rate of new technologies and products reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states or abroad changes in coverage or reimbursement rates by private payers or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business 

initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs in the us and other countries where we do business may also put pressure on medical device pricing in the us these include among others valuebased purchasing and managed care arrangements governments in china and other countries are also using various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures including increased use of competitive bidding and tenders and price regulation 

our future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development new product development requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products and technologies successfully complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 

our international operations subject us to certain business risks 

a substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the united states and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets especially in emerging markets our foreign operations subject us to certain risks relating to among other things fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above local economic and political conditions competition from local companies increases in trade 

protectionism us relations with the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements changes in local health care payment systems and health care delivery systems local product preferences and requirements longer payment terms for account receivables than we experience in the us difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations changes to international trade agreements and treaties changes in tax laws weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries and import or export licensing requirements the success of our operations outside the united states also depends in part on our ability to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and sales and distribution networks these and other factors may adversely impact our ability to pursue our growth strategy in these markets 

in addition our international operations are governed by the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws outside the us global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more enforcement proceedings by us and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties while we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws our international operations which often involve customer relationships with foreign governments create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees consultants sales agents or distributors any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations and significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities and negatively affect our reputation 

changes in us policy regarding international trade including import and export regulation and international trade agreements could also negatively impact our business the us has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from china and certain other countries which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries additional tariffs imposed by the us on a broader range of imports or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we may not be able to offset or that otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

the united kingdom’s “uk” departure from the european union “eu” commonly known as “brexit” has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the uk the eu and a number of other countries including with respect to compliance with the regulatory regimes regarding the labeling and registration of the products we sell in these markets the uk formally left the eu on january 31 2020 pursuant to the withdrawal arrangement agreed between the uk and the eu there is a transition period through december 31 2020 for the parties to negotiate their future trading relationship during this transition period the uk continues to follow the eu’s rules and its trading relationship with the eu remains the same while we have taken proactive steps to mitigate any disruption to our operations we could face increased costs volatility in exchange rates market instability and other risks depending on the outcome of the negotiations regarding the future euuk trading relationship 

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our business 

we sell products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and agencies in other countries the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable for instance there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods the availability of governmental research funding may be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 

we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 

our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be 

intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected 

operational risks 

breaches of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we rely on information systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations including sensitive personal or proprietary information in addition some of our products include information systems that collects data regarding patients and patient therapy on behalf of our customers and some connect to our systems for maintenance purposes our information systems have been subjected to attack via malicious code execution and cyber or phishing attacks and we have experienced instances of unauthorized access to our systems in the past and expect to be subject to similar cyberattacks in the future in addition to our own information in the course of doing business we sometimes store information with third parties that could be subject to attacks 

cyberattacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being accessed destroyed or stolen which could adversely affect our competitive position in the market likewise we could suffer disruption of our operations and other significant negative consequences including increased costs for security measures or remediation diversion of management attention litigation and damage to our relationships with vendors business partners and customers unauthorized tampering adulteration or interference with our products may also create issues with product functionality that could result in a loss of data risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions cyberattacks could result in unauthorized access to our systems and products which could also impact our compliance with privacy and other laws and regulations and result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation while we will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and products and work with government authorities and third party providers to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated frequent and adaptive there can be no assurances that these protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a material adverse impact on our business 

cost volatility could adversely affect our operations  

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials components freight and energy that in turn increases the costs of producing and distributing our products new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy and transportation costs as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components in particular we purchase supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products and any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results increases in oil prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs we may not be able to offset any increases in our operational costs 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components could adversely affect our operating results 

we purchase many different types of raw materials and components used in our products certain raw materials and components are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons certain raw materials and components are purchased from sole suppliers the price and supply of these materials and components may be impacted or disrupted for reasons beyond our control while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 

interruption of our manufacturing or sterilization operations could adversely affect our business 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants interruption to our manufacturing operations resulting from weather or natural disasters regulatory requirements or issues in our manufacturing process equipment failure or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in some instances we may not be able to transition manufacturing to other bd sites or a third party to replace the lost production a significant interruption of our manufacturing operations could result in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers 

in addition many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize both bd facilities and thirdparties for this process in some instances only a few facilities are qualified under applicable regulations to conduct this sterilization to the extent we or thirdparties are unable to sterilize our products whether due to lack of capacity regulatory requirements or otherwise we may be unable to transition sterilization to other sites or modalities in a timely or cost effective manner or at all which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

legal quality and regulatory risks 

we are subject to lawsuits 

we are or have been a defendan t in a number of lawsuits including among others purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and violations of federal securities laws product liability claims which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multidistrict litigation proceedings including claims relating to our hernia repair implant products surgical continence and pelvic organ prolapse products for women and vena cava filter products and suits alleging patent infringement we have also been subject to government subpoenas and civil investigative demands seeking information with respect to alleged violations of law including in connection with federal andor state healthcare programs such as medicare or medicaid federal contracting requirements andor sales and marketing practices a more detailed description of certain litigation to which we are a party is contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supp lementary data we could be subject to additional lawsuits or governmental investigations in the future 

reserves established for estimated losses with respect to legal proceedings do not represent an exact calculation of our actual liability but instead represent our estimate of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and our underlying loss reserve estimates additional reserves may be established or current reserves may be significantly increased from timetotime also in some instances we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges materially in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor liquidity 

with respect to our existing product liability litigation we believe that some settlements and judgments as well as legal defense costs may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies or in some circumstances indemnification obligations to us from other parties however amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages andor costs in addition there is no guarantee that insurers or other parties will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available for certain product liability claims or lawsuits bd does not maintain or has limited remaining insurance coverage and we may not be able to obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms or at all that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 

we are subject to extensive regulation 

our operations are global and are affected by complex state federal and international laws relating to healthcare environmental protection antitrust anticorruption marketing fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws export control  product safety and efficacy employment privacy and other areas violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions including sub stantial fines and in some cases exclusion from participation in health care programs such as medicare and medicaid environmental laws particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases are also becoming more stringent throughout the world which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate closures of or changes to our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers or result in liability to bd the enactment of additional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations 

we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of our products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may require us to incur significant costs in terms of time and resources and these costs have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda for supporting data for submissions the regulatory process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of our products governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration labeling or prohibited materials that require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries 

following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production marketing or sale of our products and result in delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances warning letters or consent decrees closure of manufacturing sites import bans seizures or recalls of products civil or criminal sanctions and damage to our reputation more stringent oversight by the fda and other agencies in recent years has resulted in incr eased enforcement activity which increases our compliance risk 

we are operating under a consent decree with the fda entered into by carefusion in 2007 and amended in 2009 that affects our alaris™ infusion pump business in the united states we are also currently operating under a warning letter issued by the fda for more information regarding the consent decree and warning letter see “regulation” under item 1 business 

as previously disclosed we are undertaking certain remediation of our bd alaris system and are currently shipping the product in the us only in cases of medical necessity we will not be able to fully resume commercial operations for the bd alaris system in the us until a 510k submission relating to the product has been filed with and subsequently cleared by the fda no assurance can be given as to the time it may take for us to obtain fda clearance of the 510k 

in addition the european union “eu” has adopted the eu medical device regulation the “eu mdr” and the in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices including in the area of clinical evidence requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have until may 2021 to meet the requirements of the eu mdr for selfcertified devices and until may 2024 for medical devices with a valid conformity assessment certificate manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic devices have until may 2022 to meet the eu ivdr complying with these regulations will require us to incur significant expenditures failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to eu conformity requirements 

we are also subject to complex and frequently changing laws in the us and elsewhere regarding privacy and the collection use storage and protection of personal information and noncompliance with these laws could result in substantial fines or litigation for instance the eu has also adopted the general data protection regulation gdpr which will apply to personal data involved in our operations in the eu or products and services that we offer to eu users involving personal data the gdpr creates a range of new compliance obligations that could require us to change our existing business practices policies and significantly increases financial penalties for noncompliance privacy regulations are evolving rapidly and we expect to continue to see regional privacy laws emerge similar to the gdpr and laws adopted in california that may impact bd businesses to the extent they rely on the use of personal data  

defects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects component failures unapproved or improper use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or as required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers enforcement actions andor investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of postmarket approval requirements 

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 

many of our businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property assets these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position in addition competitors may seek to invalidate patents on our products or claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property which could result in a loss of competitive advantage or the payment of significant legal fees damage awards and past or future royalties as well as injunctions against future sales of our products we also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the us which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

in connection with the bard acquisition we incurred significant additional indebtedness which could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and will increase our interest expense 

we substantially increased our indebtedness in connection with the bard acquisition in comparison to our indebtedness on a historical basis this could have the effect of among other things reducing our flexibility to respond to business challenges and opportunities and increasing our interest expense 

the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the bard acquisition and thus the demands on our cash resources are greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the bard acquisition the increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the bard acquisition may also reduce funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness as it becomes due and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels in addition certain of the indebtedness incurred in connection with the bard acquisition bears interest at variable interest rates if interest rates increase variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements which could further adversely affect our cash flows if we do not achieve the expected benefits 

and cost savings from the bard acquisition or if the financial performance as a combined company does not meet current expectations then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted 

in addition our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future or that we will be able to maintain our current rating furthermore our combined company’s credit ratings were lowered following the bard acquisition including below “investment grade” by moody’s investors service inc which may further increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital 

moreover in the future we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness acquisitions or working capital capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

we may not be able to service all of our indebtedness 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments however our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations of the combined company and to utilize other methods to make scheduled payments will depend on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control there can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures seek additional capital sell assets or refinance our indebtedness any such action may not be successful and we may be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred in connection with the bard acquisition impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred in connection with the bard acquisition contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to among other things have liens on our property andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person engage in certain transactions with affiliates and change the nature of our business in addition the agreements also require us to comply with certain financial covenants including financial ratios our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations 

general business risks 

we cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

we may seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky and the integration of any newlyacquired business requires significant effort and management attention the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 

natural disasters war and other events could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

natural disasters including pandemics war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts and actions taken by the united states and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and areas outside of the united states in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers

strategic objectives 

bd remains focused on delivering durable growth and creating shareholder value while making appropriate investments for the future bd 2025 our current phase of value creation is anchored in three key pillars grow simplify and empower bds management team aligns our operations and investments with these key strategic pillars through continuous focus on the following underlying objectives 

grow 

• developing and maintaining a strong portfolio of leading products and solutions that address significant unmet clinical needs improve outcomes and reduce costs 

• focusing on our core products services and solutions that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers 

• investing in research and development that will result in category innovation and a robust product pipeline 

• leveraging our global scale to expand our reach in providing access to affordable medical technologies around the world including emerging markets 

• supplementing our internal growth through strategic acquisitions 

• driving an efficient capital structure and strong shareholder returns 

simplify 

• working across our supply chain to minimize environmental impacts 

• creating more resilient operations based on an enterprisewide renewable energy strategy 

• reducing complexity across our manufacturing network and rationalizing our product portfolio 

• enhancing our quality and risk management systems 

• simplifying our internal business processes 

• focusing on cash and expense management in order to improve operating effectiveness and balance sheet productivity 

empower 

• fostering a purposedriven culture with a focus on positive impact to all stakeholders–customers patients employees and communities 

• improving our ability to serve customers and enhance customer experiences through the digitalization of internal processes and gotomarket approaches 

• cultivating an inclusive work environment that welcomes and celebrates diverse talent and perspectives 

in assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as bd’s financial condition and operating performance management generally reviews quarterly forecast data monthly actual results segment sales and other similar information we also consider trends related to certain key financial data including gross profit margin selling and administrative expense investment in research and development return on invested capital and cash flows 

covid19 pandemic impacts and response 

a novel strain of coronavirus disease “covid19” was officially declared a pandemic by the world health organization “who” in march 2020 in efforts to slow and control the spread of covid19 governments around the world issued stay at home orders travel restrictions as well as recommendations or mandates to avoid large gatherings or to selfquarantine many governments also instituted restrictions on certain businesses and their activities particularly those that were deemed nonessential these various measures led to a sudden and significant decline in economic activity within a number of countries worldwide although the global economy has shown signs of recovery current economic data indicates that full recovery has stalled in some major economies as further discussed below disruptions resulting from the ongoing covid19 pandemic unfavorably impacted our results of operations in fiscal year 2020 while certain of our organizational units realized positive benefits to revenues from the pandemic total consolidated revenues in 2020 were unfavorably impacted by an estimated net 600 million 

our financial position has remained strong and we continue to generate operating cash flows that are sufficient to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we also further secured our financial flexibility during the economic downturn by increasing the commitments available under our revolving credit facility by 381 million and issuing 30 billion of equity securities our fiscal year 2020 debt and equity transactions are further discussed in notes 3 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we believe that given our debt ratings and our capital allocation strategy we would have access to additional shortterm and longterm capital should the need arise we have not observed any impairments of our assets due to the covid19 pandemic and its adverse impact on global economic activity in 2020 

as noted above due to government restrictions and a shift in healthcare priorities there was a significant decline in medical procedures that resulted in weakened demand for our products in our fiscal year 2020 a decline in procedure volumes across acute and nonacute settings led to a decline in demand for general medical devices we also saw a deferral in elective procedures and delays in instrument placements relating to our medication management solutions including pyxis™ there was also a decrease in routine diagnostic testing and specimen collections which was offset by demand for covid19 testing additionally there was a decrease in research activity due to laboratory closures delays in clinical trial enrollment and reduced clinical testing 

during the last half of our fiscal year 2020 we noted moderate recovery in the demand for certain products including those products that are driven by the volume of elective procedures however demand for our products has not yet fully recovered and due to the continued significant uncertainty that exists relative to the duration and overall impact of the covid19 pandemic our future operating performance particularly in the shortterm will be subject to volatility the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments which are uncertain at this time including 

• the preparedness and effectiveness of countries around the world in preventing or responding to the ongoing spread of covid19 or in countries where the spread has been controlled any resurgence of the virus 

• the degree to which covid19 testing solutions continue to be made available and are utilized by governments healthcare providers and institutions retail pharmacies and the general public 

• the pace at which hospitals and clinical laboratories fully resume patient care that is not related to the covid19 pandemic 

• the timing of when research performed by research laboratories and institutions will resume to normal operations and 

• the timing and strength of any global economic recovery and the degree of pressure that the weaker macroeconomic environment will put on future healthcare utilization and the global demand for our products 

as part of our overall response to the covid19 pandemic we have deployed our capabilities expertise and scale to address critical health needs related to covid19 as follows 

• our covid19 antigen detection test that can provide results in 15 minutes using a simple nasal swab and our portable bd veritor tm plus system was approved for emergency use authorization by the us food and drug administration “fda” and received the ce marking for use in the european union 

• in addition to this immunoassay test bds portfolio of molecular solutions for covid19 testing includes three other tests that have been registered for use with our bd max tm molecular system 

• we have leveraged our category leading position as a manufacturer of needles and syringes to enter into partnerships with governments around the world to help prepare for a future covid19 vaccination campaign 

additionally we have been adhering to guidance provided by the who as well as by health officials in various countries affected by the covid19 pandemic to protect the health and safety of bd employees while ensuring continued availability of bd’s critical medical devices and technologies at this unprecedented time we have worked closely with governmental officials to keep our manufacturing facilities and those of our suppliers open due to the essential nature of our products due to our enactment of business continuity plans we have not experienced any significant disruption to our operations and supply chain to date we also enacted certain cost containment measures to mitigate the unfavorable impact of the covid19 pandemic on our results of operations such actions have included travel restrictions temporary reductions in executive compensation a temporary suspension of matching contributions to certain voluntary defined contribution and other benefit plans as well as temporary work reductions for certain manufacturing teams 

further discussion regarding the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our results in 2020 is provided below 

summary of financial results 

worldwide revenues in 2020 of 17117 billion decreased 10 from the prioryear period this decrease reflected unfavorable impacts from foreign currency translation and price of approximately 10 and 02 respectively volume increased by approximately 02 we estimate that the covid19 pandemic reduced volume growth in 2020 by approximately 33 volume in 2020 reflected the following 

• the medical segment’s revenues in 2020 reflected declines in the medication delivery solutions medication management solutions and diabetes care units that were partially offset by growth in the pharmaceutical systems unit 

• the life sciences segment’s revenues in 2020 reflected growth that was driven by the integrated diagnostic solutions unit’s sales related to covid19 diagnostic testing on the bd veritor tm plus and bd max tm systems 

• interventional segment revenues in 2020 were negatively impacted by decreased demand associated with the deferral of elective medical procedures as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

we continue to invest in research and development geographic expansion and new product market programs to drive further revenue and profit growth our ability to sustain our longterm growth will depend on a number of factors including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion develop innovative new products and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness as discussed above current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the covid19 pandemic in addition pricing pressure exists globally which could adversely impact our businesses 

as noted above our financial position remains strong with cash flows from operating activities totaling 3539 billion in 2020 at september 30 2020 we had 2937 billion in cash and equivalents and shortterm investments including restricted cash we continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of 

dividends during fiscal year 2020 we paid cash dividends of 1026 billion including 888 million paid to common shareholders and 137 million paid to preferred shareholders 

each reporting period we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period a stronger us dollar in 2020 compared with 2019 resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenues and earnings during 2020 we evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currencyneutral basis which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currencyneutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods foreign currencyneutral “fxn” information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a foreign currencyneutral basis as one measure to evaluate our performance we calculate foreign currencyneutral percentages by converting our currentperiod local currency financial results using the priorperiod foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our currentperiod results these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” results on a foreign currencyneutral basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap 

results of operations 

medical segment 

the following summarizes medical revenues by organizational unit 



a the presentation of amounts in 2019 and 2018 reflects the reclassification of 11 million and 17 million respectively associated with the movement of certain products from the medication delivery solutions unit to the medication management solutions unit which was effective on october 1 2019 

the medical segment’s revenues in 2020 reflected declines in the medication delivery solutions medication management solutions and diabetes care units that were partially offset by growth in the pharmaceutical systems unit the medication delivery solutions units revenues in 2020 reflected an unfavorable impact relating to the covid19 pandemic due to a decline in healthcare utilization particularly in the united states china and europe as expected the medication delivery solutions units 2020 revenues in china were also unfavorably impacted by a new volumebased procurement process which has been adopted by several of chinas provinces the medication management solutions units revenues in 2020 reflected a hold on us shipments of bd alaris tm infusion pumps pending compliance with certain 510k filing requirements of the fda this unfavorable impact was partially offset by international sales of infusion pumps and pandemicrelated infusion pump orders placed in the united states with medical necessity certification we continue to make progress on our regulatory filing related to the bd alaris tm infusion pumps and we currently expect the filing to be made with the fda either at the end of the second quarter or early in the third quarter of bds fiscal 

year 2021 fiscal year 2020 revenues in the diabetes care unit were unfavorably impacted by pricing pressures in the united states the pharmaceutical systems unit’s revenues in 2020 reflected continued strength in demand for prefillable products 

the medical segments revenues in 2019 were favorably impacted by the inclusion of revenues associated with certain cr bard inc bard products within the medication delivery solutions unit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 but not in the first quarter of the prioryear period as operating activities of bard which was acquired on december 29 2017 were not included in our consolidated results of operations until january 1 2018 the medication delivery solution units 2019 revenues also reflected strong growth in global sales of vascular access devices the medication management solutions units revenues in 2019 reflected sales growth attributable to the installations of infusion and dispensing systems as well as growth in sales of disposables the pharmaceutical systems units 2019 revenue growth was driven by sales of prefillable products and selfinjection systems strength in the diabetes care units sales of pen needles in emerging markets was partially offset by lower growth in us sales 

medical segment operating income was as follows 



as discussed in greater detail below the medical segments operating income in 2020 was primarily driven by a decline in gross profit margin operating income in 2019 was driven by improved gross profit margin and operating expense performance 

• the medical segments gross profit margin in 2020 was lower compared with 2019 which reflected a charge to record a probable estimate of future costs associated with incremental remediation efforts relating to bd alaris tm infusion pumps gross profit margin in 2020 also reflected unfavorable product mix and increased levels of manufacturing overhead costs that were recognized in the period rather than capitalized within inventory as a result of the covid19 pandemic unfavorable product mix in 2020 was also driven by the decline of sales in china due to the volumebased procurement process noted above gross profit margin in 2020 was also lower due to charges of 41 million recorded to write down the carrying value of certain fixed assets primarily within the medication delivery solutions and pharmaceutical systems units these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous improvement projects which enhanced the efficiency of our operations the medical segments gross profit margin in 2019 was higher as compared with 2018 primarily due to lower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous improvement projects which enhanced the efficiency of our operations additionally the comparison of gross profit margin in 2019 with gross profit margin in 2018 reflected the unfavorable impacts in 2018 of a fair value stepup adjustment relating to bards inventory on the acquisition date and charges to write down the value of fixed assets primarily in the diabetes care unit these favorable impacts to the medical segments gross margin in 2019 were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation higher raw material costs and pricing pressures 

• selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2020 was slightly lower compared with 2019 primarily due to lower expenses resulting from cost containment measures selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2019 was relatively flat compared with 2018 

• research and development expense as a percentage of revenues was higher in 2020 which reflected the decline in revenues in 2020 as well as our continued commitment to drive innovation with new products and platforms research and development expense as a percentage of revenues was lower in 2019 compared with 2018 due to recent completion of projects and the timing of project spending 

• the medical segments income in 2019 additionally reflected the estimated cumulative costs of a product recall of 75 million recorded within other operating expense net  the recall related to a product component which generally predated our acquisition of carefusion in fiscal year 2015 within the medication management solutions units infusion systems platform 

life sciences segment 

the following summarizes life sciences revenues by organizational unit 



a effective october 1 2019 the life sciences segments former preanalytical systems and diagnostic systems units were joined to create the new integrated diagnostic solutions unit additional disclosures regarding this change are provided in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the life sciences segments revenue growth in 2020 was driven by the integrated diagnostic solutions units sales related to covid19 diagnostic testing on the bd veritor tm plus and bd max tm systems this growth in the integrated diagnostic solutions unit was partially offset by pandemicrelated declines in routine diagnostic testing and specimen collections the biosciences units revenues in 2020 reflected a decline in demand for instruments and reagents as routine research and clinical lab activity slowed due to the covid19 pandemic 

the life sciences segments revenues in 2019 reflected continued strength in sales of the preanalytical systems units sales of core products in emerging markets the diagnostic systems units 2019 revenues reflected growth in its bd max tm molecular platform as well as growth in sales of core microbiology products this sales growth in the diagnostic systems unit was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison of the units us revenues in 2019 to revenues in 2018 as the prioryear period benefited from a more severe influenza season revenues in the biosciences unit in 2019 reflected growth in research reagent sales as well as growth in us research instrument sales but were unfavorably impacted by the units divestiture of the advanced bioprocessing business the biosciences units results for 2018 included revenues associated with the advanced bioprocessing business of 106 million 

life sciences segment operating income was as follows 



as discussed in greater detail below the life sciences segments operating income in 2020 reflected improved operating expense performance partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin operating income in 2019 was driven by improved gross profit margin and operating expense performance 

• the life sciences segments gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year 2020 was lower compared with the 2019 which primarily reflected unfavorable product mix and increased levels of manufacturing overhead costs that were recognized in the period rather than capitalized within 

inventory as a result of the covid19 pandemic gross margin in 2020 was also unfavorably impacted by a charge of 39 million recorded to write down the carrying value of certain intangible assets in the biosciences unit and charges of 17 million recorded to write down fixed assets in the integrated diagnostic solutions unit these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a favorable impact on product mix from the integrated diagnostic solutions units sales related to covid19 testing the life sciences segments gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year 2019 was relatively flat compared with gross margin in 2018 gross margin in 2019 was favorably impacted by lower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous improvement projects which enhanced the efficiency of our operations as well as by the unfavorable prioryear impact of the biosciences units writedown of certain intangible and other assets these favorable impacts to gross margin in 2019 were offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher raw material costs 

• selling and administrative expense as a percentage of life sciences revenues in 2020 was lower compared to 2019 primarily due to the increase in revenues that was attributable to covid19 testing lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2020 was also the result of expense synergies realized from the combination of the preanalytical systems and diagnostic systems units as noted above and lower expenses resulting from cost containment measures selling and administrative expense as a percentage of life sciences revenues in 2019 was lower compared to 2018 primarily due to reduced general and administrative spending 

• research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2020 was flat compared with 2019 as the increase in revenues that was attributable to covid19 testing was largely offset by investments in covid19 testing solutions research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2019 was lower compared with 2018 primarily due to the biosciences units recognition of writedowns in the prioryear period and also due to the timing of project spending 

interventional segment 

the following summarizes interventional revenues by organizational unit 



a the presentation of amounts in 2019 and 2018 reflects the reclassification of 185 million and 194 million respectively associated with the movement of certain products from the surgery unit and the urology and critical care unit to the peripheral intervention unit which was effective on october 1 2019 

the interventional segments revenues in 2020 particularly within the surgery and peripheral intervention units were negatively impacted by decreased demand associated with the deferral of elective medical procedures as a result of the covid19 pandemic pandemicrelated revenue declines in the urology and critical care unit were offset by demand for the units home care and targeted temperature management businesses 

the interventional segments revenues in 2019 were favorably impacted by the inclusion of revenues associated with bards products in the segments results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as noted above interventional segment revenues in 2019 also reflected growth in the urology and critical care units sales of acute urology products and sales by the units home care and targeted temperature management businesses fiscal year 2019 revenues in the surgery unit reflected growth in sales of the units biosurgery and infection prevention products the peripheral intervention units 2019 revenues reflected growth in emerging 

market sales this growth was partially offset by an unfavorable impact related to a letter issued in march 2019 by the fda to healthcare professionals regarding the use of paclitaxelcoated devices in the treatment of peripheral artery disease which impacted sales of our drugcoated balloon products 

interventional segment operating income was as follows 



as discussed in greater detail below the interventional segments operating income in 2020 was primarily driven by a decline in gross profit margin operating income in 2019 was driven by improved gross profit margin and operating expense performance 

• gross profit margin was lower in 2020 as compared with 2019 primarily due to unfavorable product mix and increased levels of manufacturing overhead costs that were recognized in the period rather than capitalized within inventory as a result of the covid19 pandemic gross profit margin was higher in 2019 as compared with 2018 primarily due to the unfavorable prioryear impact of recognizing a fair value stepup adjustment relating to bards inventory on the acquisition date and lower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous improvement projects which enhanced the efficiency of our operations and synergy initiatives these favorable impacts to the interventional segments gross margin were partially offset by unfavorable product mix and unfavorable foreign currency translation 

• selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2020 was lower compared with 2019 primarily due to lower expenses resulting from cost containment measures selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2019 was relatively flat compared with 2018 

• lower research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2020 as compared with 2019 primarily reflected the priorperiod impact of a writedown recorded by the surgery unit this writedown drove higher research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2019 as compared with 2018 

• the interventional segments lower income in 2020 additionally reflected the expiration in 2019 of a royalty income stream acquired in the bard transaction 

geographic revenues 

bd’s worldwide revenues by geography were as follows 



us revenues in 2020 were relatively flat compared with 2019 as the life sciences segments integrated diagnostic solutions units sales related to covid19 diagnostic testing largely offset the declines noted above for the medical segments medication management solutions and medication delivery solutions units as well as for the interventional segments surgery and peripheral intervention units 

us revenues in 2019 reflected growth in all three segments us revenues in 2019 were favorably impacted by the inclusion of revenues associated with bards products in results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as noted above revenue growth in 2019 was also attributable to sales in the medical segments medication management solutions unit as well as to sales in the interventional segments urology and critical care and surgery units us revenue growth in 2019 was unfavorably impacted by results in the medical 

segments diabetes care unit the life sciences segments diagnostic systems unit and the interventional segments peripheral intervention unit as previously noted in the discussions above 

international revenues in 2020 were favorably impacted by sales in the medical segments pharmaceutical systems and medication management solutions units as well as by sales in the life sciences segments integrated diagnostic solutions unit as discussed further above international revenues in 2020 were unfavorably impacted by revenue declines in china and europe for the medical segments medication delivery solutions unit as previously discussed 

international revenue growth in 2019 reflected growth in all three segments international revenues in 2019 were favorably impacted by the inclusion of revenues associated with bards products in results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as noted above fiscal year 2019 international revenue growth was also driven by sales in the medical segments medication delivery solutions and pharmaceutical systems units as well as by sales in the life sciences segments diagnostic systems and preanalytical systems units 

emerging market revenues were 242 billion 271 billion and 253 billion in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted emerging market revenues in 2020 and 2019 by an estimated 100 million and 155 million respectively revenues in emerging markets in 2020 were unfavorably impacted by a decline in healthcare utilization as a result of the covid19 pandemic as previously discussed above revenues in our medication delivery solutions unit were also unfavorably impacted by a new volumebased procurement process which has been adopted by several of chinas provinces to date the impact of these procurement initiatives to our revenues in china has been limited to our medication delivery solutions unit emerging market revenue growth in 2019 was favorably impacted by the inclusion of revenues associated with bards products in our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as noted above underlying growth in 2019 was particularly driven by sales in china and ema

g the amounts in 2019 and 2018 included additional tax benefit expense net of 50 million and 640 million respectively relating to new us tax legislation which is further discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

gross profit margin 

the comparison of gross profit margins in 2020 and 2019 and the comparison of gross profit margins in 2019 and 2018 reflected the following impacts 



the impacts of purchase accounting adjustments and other specified items include the following 

• the impact in 2020 includes a net fullyear charge of 244 million to record a probable estimate of future costs within the medication management solutions unit associated with remediation efforts related to bd alaris tm infusion pumps based on the course of our remediation efforts it is possible that this estimate could change over time any remediation actions will continue to be guided by our proactive commitment to patient safety and we will work closely with our customers to minimize the disruption of patient care 

• the impact in 2020 also includes 59 million of charges that were recorded to write down the carrying value of certain fixed assets in the medical and life sciences segments as discussed further above and a 39 million charge to write down the carrying value of certain intangible assets in the biosciences unit 

• the impact of purchase accounting adjustments and other specified items in 2019 was favorable due to a comparison to 2018 which included the recognition of fair value stepup adjustments relating to bards inventory on the acquisition date as well as writedowns of certain assets in the biosciences and diabetes care units in 2018 as further discussed above 

operating performance in 2020 primarily reflected unfavorable product mix and increased levels of manufacturing overhead costs that were recognized in the period rather than capitalized within inventory as a result of the covid19 pandemic the higher levels of manufacturing overhead costs incurred in the currentyear periods were driven to a large extent by the impact of lower plant utilization in our highly automated manufacturing sites these unfavorable impacts to operating performance were partially offset by the favorable impact on product mix from the integrated diagnostic solutions units sales related to covid19 testing as further discussed above as well as by lower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous operations improvement projects and synergy initiatives 

the operating performance impact in 2019 reflected lower manufacturing costs resulting from the continuous improvement projects and synergy initiatives as well as the favorable impact of bard on product mix operating performance in 2019 was unfavorably impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable product mix 

operating expenses 

operating expenses in 2020 2019 and 2018 were as follows 



selling and administrative 

slightly higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2020 compared with 2019 reflected the decline in revenues in 2020 higher shipping costs as a result of expedited shipments relating to covid19 as well as 25 million of funding for the bd foundation these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by lower selling expenses and favorable foreign currency translation selling and administrative spending in 2020 reflected our ongoing focus on disciplined spending and the achievement of cost synergies resulting from our acquisition of bard as well as cost containment measures we enacted to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our results of operations selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2019 was flat compared with 2018 as higher revenues and the achievement of cost synergies offset the impact of higher selling and general administrative costs attributable to bard which had a higher selling and administrative spending profile than bd in our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as noted above 

research and development 

research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2020 was higher compared with 2019 primarily due to investments in compliance with emerging regulations and investments in covid19 testing solutions as further discussed above research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2019 was relatively flat compared with 2018 spending in 2020 2019 and 2018 reflected our continued commitment to invest in new products and platforms as further discussed above expenses in 2019 included certain writedown charges in the surgery unit and expenses in 2018 included writedown charges in the biosciences unit 

acquisitions and other restructurings 

costs relating to acquisitions and other restructurings in 2020 and 2019 largely represented integration and restructuring costs incurred due to our acquisition of bard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 restructuring costs in 2020 also included costs related to simplification and other cost saving initiatives costs relating to acquisitions and other restructurings in 2018 also included integration and restructuring costs related to our fiscal year 2015 carefusion acquisition and portfolio rationalization initiatives for further disclosures regarding the costs relating to acquisitions and other restructurings refer to notes 10 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

million relating to a product recall in the medical segment as further discussed above and a pretax gain of 336 million recognized on bds sale of its advanced bioprocessing business additional disclosures regarding the product liability matters and divestiture transaction are provided in notes 5 and 11 respectively to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

net interest expense 



lower interest expense in 2020 and 2019 compared with the prioryear periods reflected debt repayments during fiscal year 2019 as well as lower overall interest rates on debt outstanding as a result of refinancing activities the decrease in interest expense in 2019 compared with 2018 also reflected higher fees incurred in 2018 to draw from a term loan facility we entered in september 2018 additional disclosures regarding our financing arrangements and debt instruments are provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the decrease in interest income in 2019 compared with 2018 reflected higher levels of cash on hand in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 in anticipation of closing the bard acquisition at the end of the quarter 

income taxes 

the income tax rates in 2020 2019 and 2018 were as follows 



the impact from specified items in 2020 was less favorable compared with the benefit associated with specified items in 2019 the effective income tax rate in 2019 reflected a favorable impact relating to the timing of certain discrete items as well as the recognition of 50 million of tax benefit recorded for the impacts of us tax legislation that was enacted in december 2017 compared with additional tax expense of 640 million that was recognized as a result of this legislation in 2018 for further disclosures regarding our accounting for this us tax legislation refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

net income and diluted earnings per share 

net income and diluted earnings per share in 2020 2019 and 2018 were as follows 



the dilutive impact from share issuances in 2018 represents the impact of bd shares issued in connection with the bard acquisition our equity transactions and the bard acquisition are further discussed in notes 3 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

financial instrument market risk 

we selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations the counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign exchange risk 

bd and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout europe greater asia canada and latin america we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency these payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions we hedge substantially all such exposures primarily through the use of forward contracts we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations including sales to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period from time to time we may purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future earnings resulting from adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions we did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2020 or 2019 

derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value for foreign currency derivatives market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities 

with respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2020 and 2019 the impact that changes in the us dollar would have on pretax earnings was estimated as follows 



these calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments 

interest rate risk 

when managing interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments we may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interestbearing investments in tandem since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure for interest rate derivative instruments fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using marketbased observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities 

the impact that changes in interest rates would have on interest rate derivatives outstanding at september 30 2020 and 2019 as well as the effect that changes in interest rates would have on our earnings or cash flows over a oneyear period based upon our overall interest rate exposure were estimated as follows 



liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows in 2020 2019 and 2018 



net cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities in 2020 reflected net income adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net source of cash this net source of cash primarily reflected higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses and lower levels of prepaid expenses partially offset by higher levels of inventory and trade receivables 

cash flows from operating activities in 2019 reflected net income adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash this net use of cash primarily reflected lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses and higher levels of inventory partially offset by lower levels of prepaid expenses the lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily attributable to cash paid related to income taxes and our product liability matters as well as the timing and amount of interest payments due in the period cash flows from operating activities in 2019 additionally reflected 200 million of discretionary cash contributions to fund our pension obligation 

cash flows from operating activities in 2018 reflected net income adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net source of cash this net source of cash primarily reflected higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily due to higher income taxes payable as a result of new us tax legislation  as well as lower levels of inventory partially offset by higher levels of trade receivables the change in cash flows from operating activities in 2018 also reflected a change to deferred tax asset and liability balances which were remeasured under new tax legislation which is further discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the change in cash flows from operating activities in 2018 additionally reflected discretionary cash contributions of 287 million to fund our pension obligation

access to capital and credit ratings 

our corporate credit ratings with the rating agencies standard  poors ratings services sp moodys investor service moodys and fitch ratings fitch were as follows at september 30 2020 



in march 2020 standard  poors ratings services affirmed our september 30 2019 ratings and revised the agencys outlook regarding the likely direction of these ratings from stable to negative 

lower corporate debt ratings and further downgrades of our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing we believe that given our debt ratings our financial management policies our ability to generate cash flow and the noncyclical geographically diversified nature of our businesses we would have access to additional shortterm and longterm capital should the need arise a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities ratings can be revised 

upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change

a longterm debt obligations include expected principal and interest obligations 

b purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements

d required funding obligations for 2021 relating to pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material 

critical accounting policies 

the following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold which is generally upon shipment or delivery depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex and therefore significantly affects the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the product are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed for certain service arrangements including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term the majority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain instruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period 

our agreements with customers within certain organizational units including medication management solutions integrated diagnostic solutions and biosciences contain multiple performance obligations including 

both products and certain services noted above determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require judgment the transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price standalone selling price is the amount at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer we generally estimate standalone selling prices using list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers the use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral 

our gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions which include rebates and sales discounts these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and judgment is required when determining the impact on gross revenues for a reporting period additional factors considered in the estimate of our rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to our distributors as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates 

impairment of assets 

goodwill assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with finite lives including developed technology and other longlived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or 

one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units generally represent one 

level below reporting segments potential impairment of goodwill is generally identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value our annual goodwill impairment test performed on july 1 2020 did not result in any impairment charges as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

we generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures the value of our income producing assets this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use appropriate discount rates terminal values and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with bd’s business plans the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset actual results may differ from management’s estimates 

income taxes 

bd maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 

bd conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions our past audit experience with similar situations and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters bd’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if upon resolution with taxing authorities we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

we have reviewed our needs in the united states for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and we continue to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the united states to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property plant and equipment expenditure needs as a result we are permanently reinvested with respect to all of our historical foreign earnings as of september 30 2020 additional disclosures regarding our accounting for income taxes are provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

contingencies 

we are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including without limitation product liability and environmental matters as further discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses we establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries a determination of the amount of accruals for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual matter when appropriate the accrual is developed with the consultation of outside counsel and as in the case of certain mass tort litigation the expertise of an actuarial specialist regarding the nature timing and extent of each matter the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our litigation strategy we record expected recoveries from product liability insurance carriers or other parties when realization of recovery is deemed probable 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows 

benefit plans 

we have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations that are measured using actuarial valuations which include assumptions for the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

the discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date september 30 specifically for the us pension plan we will use a discount rate of 280 for 2021 which was based on an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date to calculate the pension expense in 2021 we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2021 are provided in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption although reviewed each year changes less frequently due to the longterm nature of the assumption this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date rather it is used only in the calculation of pension expense to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider many factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results benchmark data expected returns on various plan asset classes as well as current and expected asset allocations we will use a longterm expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 625 for the us pension plan in 2021 we believe our discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our us pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows 

• discount rate — a change of plus minus 25 basis points with other assumptions held constant would have an estimated 12 million favorable unfavorable impact on the total us net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan costs this estimate assumes no change in the shape or steepness of the companyspecific yield curve used to plot the individual spot rates that will be applied to the future cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost 

• expected return on plan assets — a change of plus minus 25 basis points with other assumptions held constant would have an estimated 5 million favorable unfavorable impact on us pension plan costs

distribution 

bd’s products are marketed and distributed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to hospitals and other healthcare institutions by bd and independent sales representatives bd uses acute care nonacute care laboratory and drug wholesaler distributors to broadly support our overall disposable product demand from our end user customers in the united states in international markets products are distributed either directly or through distributors with the practice varying by country order backlog is not material to bd’s business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock bd’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the medication delivery solutions business unit and flu diagnostic products in the diagnostic systems business unit which relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza in order to service its customers optimize logistics lower facilities costs and reduce finished goods inventory levels bd operates consolidated distribution facilities in both the united states and europe orders are normally shipped within a matter of days after receipt 

raw materials and components 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials and components including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products bd seeks to ensure continuity of supply by securing multiple options for sourcing however there are situations where raw materials and components are only available from one supplier which are referred to as sole sourced the use of sole sourced materials and components may be due to sourcing of proprietary andor patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product in other cases while a raw material or component can be sourced from multiple manufacturers only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance cost or other considerations in order to provide alternate sources bd must complete a rigorous qualification process which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval if clinical trials are not required this qualification process can take 318 months depending on the criticality of the change when clinical trials are required this process may lengthen the qualification phase from one to three years bd continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and components and maintains business continuity plans with its suppliers bd’s continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities maintaining contingency stock internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts while bd works closely with its suppliers no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful and there may be events that cause supply interruption reduction or termination that adversely impacts bd’s ability to manufacture and sell certain products

intellectual property and licenses 

bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bd’s business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bd’s business as a whole or to any business segment 

competition 

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment in addition the entry into the market of lowcost manufacturers has created increased pricing pressures bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement in support of its core strategies see further discussion of the risks relating to competition in the medical technology industry in item 1a risk factors 

thirdparty reimbursement 

reimbursement remains an important strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical technology difficulty in obtaining coverage coding and payment resulting in decreased market access can be a significant barrier to the commercial success of a new product or procedure the consequences can include slow adoption in the marketplace and inadequate payment levels that can continue for months or even years 

a majority of bd’s customers rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures products and services they provide vertical integration has created a very concentrated market among payers global payers are increasingly focused on strategies to control spending on healthcare and reward improvements in quality and patient outcomes 

bd is actively engaged in identifying and communicating value propositions of its products for payer provider and patient stakeholders and it employs various efforts and resources to attempt to positively impact coverage coding and payment pathways however bd has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and payment levels for bd products the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer’s discretion as bd’s product offerings are diverse across a variety of healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment pathways that impact the decisions of healthcare providers regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products therefore changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products in any given country for any given product 

as government programs seek to expand healthcare coverage for their citizens they have at the same time sought to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures products or services many payers have developed specific payment and delivery mechanisms to support these cost control efforts and to focus on paying for value these mechanisms include payment reductions pay for performance measures qualitybased performance payments restrictive coverage policies bidding and tender mechanics studies to compare the effectiveness of therapies and use of technology assessments these changes whether the result of legislation new strategic alliances or market consolidations have created an increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective and qualitydriven healthcare 

for example as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” the us is implementing valuebased payment methodologies and seeking to create alternative payment models such as bundled payments to continue to drive improved value we see other governments around the world considering similar bundling reform measures with the utilization of the diagnosis related group “drg” as a payment mechanism to drive toward quality and resource based reimbursement becoming more common in regions outside the us 

in addition most payers are seeking price predictability in order to mitigate future exposure to manufacturer price increases this is coupled with an increase in high deductible private insurance plans which transfer more pricing exposure and burden directly to the patient 

regulation 

general 

bds operations are global and are affected by complex state federal and international laws relating to healthcare environmental protection antitrust anticorruption marketing fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws export control employment privacy and other areas 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

bd actively maintains fdaiso quality systems that establish standards for its product design manufacturing and distribution processes prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of bd’s quality systems as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials these regulatory controls as well as any changes in fda policies can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

bd also is subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the united states concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws global anticorruption transportation safety and health and customs and exports many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years this appears to be part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the united states 

in addition as part of ppaca the federal government has enacted the sunshine act provisions requiring bd to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals failure to comply with these provisions could result in a range of fines penalties andor other sanctions 

consent decree with fda 

our infusion pump organizational unit is operating under an amended consent decree entered into by carefusion with the fda in 2007 carefusion’s consent decree with the fda related to its alaris™ se infusion pumps in february 2009 carefusion and the fda amended the consent decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for carefusion 303 inc the organizational unit that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the united states the amended consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories 

while this bd organizational unit remains subject to the amended consent decree which includes the requirements of the original consent decree it has made substantial progress in its compliance efforts however we cannot predict the outcome of this matter and the amended consent decree authorizes the fda in the event of any violations in the future to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing infusion pumps recall products and take other actions we may be required to pay damages of 15000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree up to 15 million per year 

we also cannot currently predict whether additional monetary investment will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matter’s ultimate impact on our business we may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because among other things the fda may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree andor we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree as of september 30 2019 we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the amended consent decree and accordingly we have no accruals associated with compliance with the amended consent decree 

fda warning letter 

in may 2017 the fda conducted inspections at bd’s preanalytical systems “pas” facility in franklin lakes new jersey in july 2017 the fda issued a form 483 to bd pas in connection with these inspections that contained observations of nonconformance relating to quality system regulations and medical device reporting relating to certain of our bd vacutainer™ edta blood collection tubes on january 11 2018 bd received a warning letter from the fda citing certain alleged violations of quality system regulations and of law the warning letter states that until bd resolves the outstanding issues covered by the warning letter the fda will not clear or approve any premarket submissions for class iii devices to which the nonconformances are reasonably related or grant requests for certificates to foreign governments we submitted our response to the warning letter on january 31 2018 

bd is working closely with the fda and intends to fully implement corrective actions to address the concerns identified in the warning letter however bd cannot give any assurances that the fda will be satisfied with its responses to the warning letter or as to the expected date of resolution of matters included in the warning letter while bd does not believe that the issues identified in the warning letter will have a material impact on bd’s operation no assurances can be given that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on bd’s business results of operations financial conditions andor liquidity 

consent order  covington georgia 

on october 28 2019 bd entered into a consent order with the environmental protection division of the georgia department of natural resources the “epd” following the filing of a complaint and motion for temporary restraining order by the epd seeking to enjoin bd from continuing sterilization operations at its covington georgia facility under the terms of the consent order bd voluntarily agreed to a number of operational changes at its covington and madison georgia facilities designed to further reduce ethylene oxide emissions including but not limited to operating at a reduced capacity bd does not believe that the consent order will have a material impact on its operations violation of the consent order though could subject us to additional restrictions on the sterilization operations at our covington and madison facilities bd has business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of any additional restrictions on our operations at these facilities although it is possible that these plans will not be able to fully offset such impact

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows we may also be adversely impacted by other risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

a downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our operations 

deterioration in the domestic or international economic environment particularly in emerging markets and countries with governmentsponsored healthcare systems may cause decreased demand for our products and services and increased competition which could result in lower sales volume and lower prices for our products longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply we have previously experienced delays in collecting government receivables in certain countries in western europe due to 

economic conditions and we may experience similar delays in the future in these and other countries or regions experiencing financial problems 

the medical technology industry is very competitive 

we are a global company that faces significant competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies with multiple product lines some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do as well as firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines nontraditional entrants such as technology companies are also entering into the healthcare industry some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we face competition across all our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features clinical or economic outcomes product quality availability price services and other factors our ability to compete is also impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements such as increased demand for more environmentallyfriendly products and for products incorporating digital capabilities as well as changes in the ways health care services are delivered including the transition of more care from acute to nonacute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs improve clinical results and expand patient access our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we meet these changing market demands in terms of our product offerings and marketing approaches 

the medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change and discovery and frequent product introductions the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology that provide better features pricing clinical outcomes or economic value may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device lower cost producers have also created pricing pressure particularly in developing markets 

the medical technology industry has also experienced a significant amount of consolidation resulting in companies with greater scale and market presence than bd traditional distributors are also manufacturers of medical devices providing another source of competition in addition health care systems and other providers are consolidating resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies as a result competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the demand for and prices of our products 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

a substantial amount of our revenues are derived from international operations and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the us in the future the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 7 management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks 

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers or other cost containment measures could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by 

government authorities including medicare medicaid and comparable foreign programs and private insurers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources and by country may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction reimbursement rates can also affect the market acceptance rate of new technologies and products reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states or abroad changes in coverage or reimbursement rates by private payers or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business 

initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs in the us and other countries where we do business may also put pressure on medical device pricing in the us these include among others valuebased purchasing and managed care arrangements governments in china and other countries are also using various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures including increased use of competitive bidding and tenders and price regulation 

the reinstatement of the ppacas medical device tax may adversely affect our results of operations 

the ppaca imposes on medical device manufacturers such as bd a 23 excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices while the excise tax has been suspended until the end of 2019 absent further legislative action it will be reinstated in 2020 which would adversely affect our results of operation 

cost volatility could adversely affect our operations 

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials components freight and energy that in turn increases the costs of producing and distributing our products new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy and transportation costs as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components in particular we purchase supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products and any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results increases in oil prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs we may not be able to offset any increases in our operational costs 

breaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations including sensitive personal information and proprietary or confidential information in addition some of our products include information technology that collects data regarding patients and patient therapy on behalf of our customers and some connect to our systems for maintenance purposes our information technology systems have been subjected to attack via malicious code execution and cyber or phishing attacks and we have experienced instances of unauthorized access to our systems in the past and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future in addition to our own information in the course of doing business we sometimes store information with third parties that could be subject to these types of attacks 

cyberattacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being accessed or stolen which could adversely affect our competitive position in the market likewise we could suffer disruption of our operations and other significant negative consequences including increased costs for security measures or remediation diversion of management attention litigation and damage to our relationships with vendors business partners and customers unauthorized tampering adulteration or interference with our products may also create issues with product functionality that could result in a loss of data risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions cyberattacks could result in unauthorized access to our systems and products which could also impact our compliance with privacy and other laws and regulations and result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation while we will continue to dedicate significant resources to 

protect against unauthorized access to our systems and products and work with government authorities and third party providers to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated frequent and adaptive there can be no assurances that these protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development new product development requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products and technologies successfully complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 

we cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

we may seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky and the integration of any newlyacquired business requires significant effort and management attention the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 

our international operations subject us to certain business risks 

a substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the united states and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets especially in emerging markets our foreign operations subject us to certain risks relating to among other things fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above local economic and political conditions competition from local companies increases in trade protectionism us relations with the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements changes in local health care payment systems and health care delivery systems local product preferences and requirements longer payment terms for account receivables than we experience in the us difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations changes to international trade agreements and treaties changes in tax laws weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries and import or export licensing requirements the success of our operations outside the united states also depends in part on our ability to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and sales and distribution networks these and other factors may adversely impact our ability to pursue our growth strategy in these markets 

in addition our international operations are governed by the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws outside the us global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more enforcement proceedings by us and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties while we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws our international operations which often involve customer relationships with foreign governments create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees consultants sales agents or distributors any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations and significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities and negatively affect our reputation 

changes in us policy regarding international trade including import and export regulation and international trade agreements could also negatively impact our business the us has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from china and certain other countries which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries additional tariffs imposed by the us on a broader range of imports or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we may not be able to offset or that otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

the june 2016 referendum in the united kingdom “uk” to exit the european union “eu” commonly known as “brexit” has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the uk and the eu and possibly other countries including with respect to compliance with the regulatory regimes regarding the labeling and registration of the products we sell in these markets the possibility that the uk may exit the eu without a formal withdrawal agreement in place has increased the uncertainty around brexit while we have taken proactive steps to mitigate any disruption to our operations we could face increased regulatory costs volatility in exchange rates market instability and other risks depending on the final terms of the uk’s exit from the eu 

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our business 

we sell products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and agencies in other countries the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable for instance there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods the availability of governmental research funding may be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components could adversely affect our operating results 

we purchase many different types of raw materials and components used in our products certain raw materials and components are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons certain raw materials and components are purchased from sole suppliers the price and supply of these materials and components may be impacted or disrupted for reasons beyond our control while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 

interruption of our manufacturing or sterilization operations could adversely affect our business 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants interruption to our manufacturing operations resulting from weather or natural disasters regulatory requirements or issues in our manufacturing process equipment failure or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in some instances we may not be able to transition manufacturing to other bd sites or a third party to replace the lost production a significant interruption of our manufacturing operations could result in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers 

in addition many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize both bd facilities and thirdparties for this process in some instances only a few facilities are qualified under applicable regulations to conduct this sterilization to the extent we or thirdparties are unable to sterilize our products whether due to 

lack of capacity regulatory requirements or otherwise we may be unable to transition sterilization to other sites or modalities in a timely or cost effective manner or at all which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

we are subject to lawsuits 

we are or have been a defendant in a number of lawsuits including among others purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations product liability claims which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multidistrict litigation proceedings including claims relating to our hernia repair implant products surgical continence and pelvic organ prolapse products for women and vena cava filter products and suits alleging patent infringement we have also been subject to government subpoenas seeking information with respect to alleged violations of law including in connection with federal andor state healthcare programs such as medicare or medicaid andor sales and marketing practices such as the civil investigative demands a more detailed description of certain litigation to which we are a party is contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we could be subject to additional lawsuits or governmental investigations in the future 

reserves established for estimated losses with respect to legal proceedings do not represent an exact calculation of our actual liability but instead represent our estimate of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and our underlying loss reserve estimates additional reserves may be established or current reserves may be significantly increased from timetotime also in some instances we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges materially in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor liquidity 

with respect to our existing product liability litigation we believe that some settlements and judgments as well as legal defense costs may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies or in some circumstances indemnification obligations to us from other parties however amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages andor costs in addition there is no guarantee that insurers or other parties will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available for certain product liability claims or lawsuits bd does not maintain or has limited remaining insurance coverage and we may not be able to obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms or at all that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 

we are subject to extensive regulation 

our operations are global and are affected by complex state federal and international laws relating to healthcare environmental protection antitrust anticorruption marketing fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws export control employment privacy and other areas violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and in some cases exclusion from participation in health care programs such as medicare and medicaid environmental laws particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases are also becoming more stringent throughout the world which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate closures of or changes to our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers or result in liability to bd the enactment of additional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations 

we are also subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of our products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may require us to incur significant costs in terms of time and resources and these costs have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda for supporting data for submissions the regulatory process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of our products governmental 

agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration labeling or prohibited materials that require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries 

following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production marketing or sale of our products and result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances warning letters or consent decrees closure of manufacturing sites import bans seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation more stringent oversight by the fda and other agencies in recent years has resulted in increased enforcement activity which increases our compliance risk 

we are operating under a consent decree with the fda entered into by carefusion in 2007 and amended in 2009 that affects our alaris™ infusion pump business in the united states we are also currently operating under a warning letter issued by the fda for more information regarding the consent decree and warning letter see “regulation” under item 1 business 

in march 2019 the fda issued a letter to healthcare professionals regarding the use of paclitaxelcoated devices in the treatment of peripheral artery disease advising clinicians to consider using alternative treatments the fda letter resulted in decreased sales of bd’s drugcoated balloons in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior year the extent and duration of the impact from the fda letter beyond fiscal year 2019 and the likelihood of fda approval of new drugcoated devices is difficult to predict and no assurance can be given that it will not have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods 

in addition the european union “eu” has adopted the eu medical device regulation the “eu mdr” and the in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have until may 2020 to meet the requirements of the eu mdr and until may 2022 to meet the eu ivdr complying with these regulations will require us to incur significant expenditures failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to eu requirements 

we are also subject to complex and frequently changing laws in the us and elsewhere regarding privacy and the collection use storage and protection of personal information and noncompliance with these laws could result in substantial fines or litigation for instance the eu has also adopted the general data protection regulation gdpr which will apply to personal data involved in our operations in the eu or products and services that we offer to eu users involving personal data the gdpr creates a range of new compliance obligations that could require us to change our existing business practices policies and significantly increases financial penalties for noncompliance 

defects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects component failures unapproved or improper use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or as required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers enforcement actions andor investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of postmarket approval requirements 

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 

many of our businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property assets these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position in addition competitors may seek to invalidate patents on our products or claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property which could result in a loss of competitive advantage or the payment of significant legal fees damage awards and past or future royalties as well as injunctions against future sales of our products we also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the us which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

natural disasters war and other events could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

natural disasters including pandemics war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts and actions taken by the united states and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and areas outside of the united states in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers 

we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 

our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits and cost savings resulting from our acquisition of bard 

while we have realized significant cost savings to date in connection with our acquisition of bard achieving additional cost synergies may prove more difficult than expected and it is possible that the anticipated cost synergies of the merger may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected 

in connection with the bard acquisition we incurred significant additional indebtedness which could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and will increase our interest expense 

we have substantially increased our indebtedness in connection with the bard acquisition through the incurrence of new indebtedness to finance the acquisition and the assumption of bard’s existing indebtedness in comparison to our indebtedness on a recent historical basis this could have the effect of among other things reducing our flexibility to respond to business challenges and opportunities and increasing our interest expense 

the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the bard acquisition and thus the demands on our cash resources are greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the bard acquisition the increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the bard acquisition may also reduce funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness as it becomes due and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels in addition certain of the indebtedness incurred in connection with the bard acquisition bears interest at variable interest rates if interest rates increase variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements which could further adversely affect our cash flows if we do not achieve the expected benefits 

and cost savings from the bard acquisition or if the financial performance as a combined company does not meet current expectations then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted 

in addition our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future or that we will be able to maintain our current rating furthermore our combined company’s credit ratings were lowered following the bard acquisition including below “investment grade” by moody’s investors service inc which may further increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital 

moreover in the future we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness acquisitions or other general corporate requirements our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

we may not be able to service all of our indebtedness 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments however our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations of the combined company and to utilize other methods to make scheduled payments will depend on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control there can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures seek additional capital sell assets or refinance our indebtedness any such action may not be successful and we may be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred in connection with the bard acquisition impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred in connection with the bard acquisition contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to among other things have liens on our property andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person engage in certain transactions with affiliates and change the nature of our business in addition the agreements also require us to comply with certain financial covenants including financial ratios our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations

other similar information we also consider trends related to certain key financial data including gross profit margin selling and administrative expense investment in research and development return on invested capital and cash flows 

summary of financial results 

worldwide revenues in 2019 of 17290 billion increased 82 from the prioryear period the increase reflected a favorable impact of approximately 6 resulting from the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of bard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 but not in the first quarter of the prioryear period as operating activities of the business which was acquired on december 29 2017 were not included in our consolidated results of operations until january 1 2018 revenues in 2019 also reflected an unfavorable impact of almost 1 attributable to the biosciences units divestiture of its advanced bioprocessing business at the end of october 2018 as is further discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data revenue growth in 2019 additionally reflected volume growth of approximately 54 an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 23 and an unfavorable impact of price of approximately 03 volume growth in 2019 was as follows 

 

we continue to invest in research and development geographic expansion and new product market programs to drive further revenue and profit growth our ability to sustain our longterm growth will depend on a number of factors including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion develop innovative new products and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness while the economic environment for the healthcare industry and healthcare utilization in the united states is generally stable destabilization in the future could adversely impact our businesses additionally macroeconomic challenges in europe continue to constrain healthcare utilization although we currently view the environment as stable in emerging markets the company’s growth is dependent primarily on government funding for healthcare systems in addition pricing pressure exists globally which could adversely impact our businesses 

our financial position remains strong with cash flows from operating activities totaling 3330 billion in 2019  at september 30 2019  we had 620 million in cash and equivalents and shortterm investments including restricted cash we continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends during fiscal year 2019  we paid cash dividends of 984 million  including 832 million paid to common shareholders and 152 million paid to preferred shareholders 

each reporting period we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period a stronger us dollar in 2019  compared with 2018  resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenues and earnings during 2019  we evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currencyneutral basis which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currencyneutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods foreign currencyneutral fxn information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a foreign currencyneutral basis as one measure to evaluate our performance we calculate foreign currencyneutral percentages by converting our currentperiod local currency financial results using the priorperiod foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our currentperiod results these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap results on a foreign currencyneutral basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled 

measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap 

results of operations 

medical segment

financial instrument market risk 

we selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations the counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign exchange risk 

bd and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout europe greater asia canada and latin america we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency these payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions we hedge substantially all such exposures primarily through the use of forward contracts we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations including sales to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period from time to time we may purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future earnings resulting from adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions we did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2019 or 2018  

derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value for foreign currency derivatives market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities 

with respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2019 and 2018  the impact that changes in the us dollar would have on pretax earnings was estimated as follows 



these calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments 

interest rate risk 

when managing interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments we may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interestbearing investments in tandem since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure for interest rate derivative instruments fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using marketbased observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities 

the impact that changes in interest rates would have on interest rate derivatives outstanding at september 30 2019 and 2018  as well as the effect that changes in interest rates would have on our earnings or cash flows over a oneyear period based upon our overall interest rate exposure were estimated as follows

debtrelated activities 

certain measures relating to our total debt were as follows 



 

the decrease in shortterm debt as a percentage of total debt at september 30 2019 was primarily driven by the payment of certain shortterm notes as well as the issuance of longterm notes in 2019 the increase in shortterm debt as a percentage of total debt at september 30 2018 was primarily driven by the reclassification of certain notes from longterm to shortterm additional disclosures regarding our debt instruments are provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

cash and shortterm investments 

at september 30 2019  total worldwide cash and shortterm investments were 620 million  including restricted cash which was primarily held in jurisdictions outside of the united states

lower corporate debt ratings and further downgrades of our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing we believe that given our debt ratings our financial management policies our ability to generate cash flow and the noncyclical geographically diversified nature of our businesses we would have access to additional shortterm and longterm capital should the need arise a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change 

contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future the table below sets forth bd’s significant contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of september 30 2019  



  

 critical accounting policies 

the following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate 

or assumption made by management it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold which is generally upon shipment or delivery depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex and therefore significantly affects the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the product are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed for certain service arrangements including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term the majority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain instruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period 

our agreements with customers within certain organizational units including medication management solutions diagnostic systems and biosciences contain multiple performance obligations including both products and certain services noted above determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require judgment the transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price standalone selling price is the amount at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer we generally estimate standalone selling prices using its list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers the use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral 

our gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions which include rebates and sales discounts these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and judgment is required when determining the impact on gross revenues for a reporting period additional factors considered in the estimate of our rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to our distributors as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates 

impairment of assets 

goodwill assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with finite lives including developed technology and other longlived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or 

one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units generally represent one 

level below reporting segments potential impairment of goodwill is generally identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value our annual goodwill impairment test performed on july 1 2019 did not result in any impairment charges as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

we generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use appropriate discount rates terminal values and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with bd’s business plans the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and potentially result in different impacts to bd’s results of operations actual results may differ from management’s estimates 

income taxes 

bd maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted management evaluates factors such as prior 

earnings history expected future earnings carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 

bd conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions our past audit experience with similar situations and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters bd’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if upon resolution with taxing authorities we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

we have reviewed our needs in the united states for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and we continue to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the united states to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property plant and equipment expenditure needs as a result after reevaluation of the permanent reinvestment assertion we are permanently reinvested with respect to all of our historical foreign earnings as of september 30 2019 additional disclosures regarding our accounting for income taxes are provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

contingencies 

we are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including without limitation product liability and environmental matters as further discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses we establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries a determination of the amount of accruals for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue when appropriate the accrual is developed with the consultation of outside counsel and as in the case of certain mass tort litigation the expertise of an actuarial specialist regarding the nature timing and extent of each matter the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters we record expected recoveries from product liability insurance carriers or other parties when those recoveries are probable and collectible 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows 

benefit plans 

we have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations these benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate pension benefit costs also include an assumption for the expected return on plan assets these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

the discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date september 30 specifically for the us pension plan we will use a discount rate of 321 for 2020  which was based on an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date to calculate the pension expense in 2020  we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2020 are provided in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption although reviewed each year changes less frequently due to the longterm nature of the assumption this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date rather it is used only in the calculation of pension expense to 

determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider many factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results benchmark data expected returns on various plan asset classes as well as current and expected asset allocations we will use a longterm expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 725 for the us pension plan in 2020  we believe our discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our us pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows 

 cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

bd and its representatives may from time to time make certain forwardlooking statements in publicly released materials both written and oral including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission press releases and our reports to shareholders forwardlooking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan” “expect” “believe” “intend” “will” “may” “anticipate” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with among other things discussions of future operations and financial performance including volume growth pricing sales and earnings per share growth and cash flows and statements regarding our strategy for growth future product development regulatory approvals competitive position and expenditures all statements that address our future operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forwardlooking statements 

forwardlooking statements are and will be based on management’s thencurrent views and assumptions regarding future events developments and operating performance and speak only as of their dates investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements furthermore we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information future events and developments or otherwise except as required by applicable law or regulations 

the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements for further discussion of certain of these factors see item 1a risk factors in this report

foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues bd believes its activities in some countries outside the united states involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein as well as the economic environment local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties see further discussion of this risk in item 1a risk factors 

distribution 

bd’s products are marketed and distributed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to hospitals and other healthcare institutions by bd and independent sales representatives bd uses acute care nonacute care laboratory and drug wholesaler distributors to broadly support our overall disposable product demand from our end user customers in the united states in international markets products are distributed either directly or through distributors with the practice varying by country order backlog is not material to bd’s business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock bd’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the medication delivery solutions business unit and flu diagnostic products in the diagnostic systems business unit which relate to seasonal diseases such 

as influenza in order to service its customers optimize logistics lower facilities costs and reduce finished goods inventory levels bd operates consolidated distribution facilities in both the united states and europe orders are normally shipped within a matter of days after receipt 

raw materials and components 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials and components including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products bd seeks to ensure continuity of supply by securing multiple options for sourcing however there are situations where raw materials and components are only available from one supplier which are referred to as sole sourced the use of sole sourced materials and components may be due to sourcing of proprietary andor patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product in other cases while a raw material or component can be sourced from multiple manufacturers only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance cost or other considerations in order to provide alternate sources bd must complete a rigorous qualification process which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval if clinical trials are not required this qualification process can take 318 months depending on the criticality of the change when clinical trials are required this process may lengthen the qualification phase from one to three years bd continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and components and maintains business continuity plans with its suppliers bd’s continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities maintaining contingency stock internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts while bd works closely with its suppliers no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful and there may be events that cause supply interruption reduction or termination that adversely impacts bd’s ability to manufacture and sell certain products 

research and development 

bd conducts its research and development “rd” activities at its operating units and at bd technologies in research triangle park north carolina the majority of bd’s rd activities are conducted in north america outside north america bd primarily conducts rd activities in china france india ireland and singapore bd also collaborates with certain universities medical centers and other entities on rd programs and retains individual consultants and partners to support its efforts in specialized fields bd spent approximately 1006 million 774 million and 828 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended september 30 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

intellectual property and licenses 

bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bd’s business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bd’s business as a whole or to any business segment 

competition 

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive 

environment in addition the entry into the market of lowcost manufacturers are creating increased pricing pressures some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs 

bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement in support of its core strategies 

thirdparty reimbursement 

reimbursement remains an important strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical devices and procedures difficulty in obtaining coverage coding and payment can be a significant barrier to the commercial success of a new product or procedure the consequences can include slow adoption in the marketplace and inadequate payment levels that can continue for months or even years 

a majority of bd’s customers rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures products and services they provide these payers in the united states and abroad are increasingly focused on strategies to control spending on healthcare and reward improvements in quality and patient outcomes 

bd is actively engaged in identifying and communicating value propositions of its products for payer provider and patient stakeholders and it employs various efforts and resources to attempt to positively impact coverage coding and payment pathways however bd has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and payment levels for bd products the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer’s discretion as bd’s product offerings are diverse across a variety of healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment pathways that impact the decisions of healthcare providers regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products therefore changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products in any given country for any given product 

as government programs seek to expand healthcare coverage for their citizens they have at the same time sought to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures products or services many thirdparty payers have developed specific payment and delivery mechanisms to support these cost control efforts and to focus on paying for value these mechanisms include payment reductions pay for performance measures qualitybased performance payments restrictive coverage policies bidding and tender mechanics studies to compare the effectiveness of therapies and use of technology assessments these changes whether the result of legislation new strategic alliances or market consolidations have created an increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective and qualitydriven healthcare 

  for example as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” the us is implementing value based payment methodologies and seeking to create alternative payment models such as bundled payments to continue to drive improved value we see other governments around the world considering similar bundling reform measures including the development of the diagnosis related group “drg” as a payment mechanism to drive toward quality and resource based reimbursement 

regulation 

general 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

bd actively maintains fdaiso quality systems that establish standards for its product design manufacturing and distribution processes prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of bd’s quality systems as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials these regulatory controls as well as any changes in fda policies can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

bd also is subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the united states concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws global anticorruption transportation safety and health and customs and exports many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years this appears to be part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the united states 

in addition as part of ppaca the federal government has enacted the sunshine act provisions requiring bd to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals failure to comply with these provisions could result in a range of fines penalties andor other sanctions 

consent decree 

our infusion pump organizational unit is operating under an amended consent decree entered into by carefusion with the fda in 2007 carefusion’s consent decree with the fda related to its alaris™ se infusion pumps in february 2009 carefusion and the fda amended the consent decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for carefusion 303 inc the organizational unit that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the united states the amended consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories 

while this bd organizational unit remains subject to the amended consent decree which includes the requirements of the original consent decree it has made substantial progress in its compliance efforts however we cannot predict the outcome of this matter and the amended consent decree authorizes the fda in the event of any violations in the future to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing infusion pumps recall products and take other actions we may be required to pay damages of 15000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree up to 15 million per year 

we also cannot currently predict whether additional monetary investment will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matter’s ultimate impact on our business we may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because among other things the fda may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree andor we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree as of september 30 2018 we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the amended consent decree and accordingly we have no accruals associated with compliance with the amended consent decree 

fda warning letters 

in may 2017 the fda conducted inspections at bd’s preanalytical systems “pas” facility in franklin lakes new jersey in july 2017 the fda issued a form 483 to bd pas in connection with these inspections that contained observations of nonconformance relating to quality system regulations and medical device reporting relating to certain of our bd vacutainer™ edta blood collection tubes on january 11 2018 bd received a warning letter from the fda citing certain alleged violations of quality system regulations and of law the warning letter states that until bd resolves the outstanding issues covered by the warning letter the fda will not clear or approve any premarket submissions for class iii devices to which the nonconformances are reasonably related or grant requests for certificates to foreign governments we submitted our response to the warning letter on january 31 2018 

the fda conducted an inspection of bd’s facility located in franklin wisconsin “bd franklin site” from may 16 2018 through august 1 2018 on august 1 2018 the fda issued a form 483 to the bd franklin site in connection with these inspections that contained observations of nonconformance relating to quality system regulations relating to certain prefilled heparin lock flush syringes and prefilled 09 sodium chloride lock flush syringes on september 14 2018 bd received a warning letter from the fda citing certain alleged violations of quality system regulations and of law in the warning letter fda stated that bd’s response appears to be adequate but that several of the actions are still in progress and a followup inspection by fda of the site will be necessary to verify compliance we submitted our response to the warning letter on   october 1 2018 

bd is working closely with the fda and intends to fully implement corrective actions to address the concerns identified in the warning letters however bd cannot give any assurances that the fda will be satisfied with its responses to the warning letters or as to the expected date of resolution of matters included in the warning letters while bd does not believe that the issues identified in the warning letters will have a material impact on bd’s operation no assurances can be given that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on bd’s business results of operations financial conditions andor liquidity

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows 

risks relating to bd 

a downturn in global economic conditions could adversely affect our operations 

deterioration in the global economic environment particularly in emerging markets and countries with governmentsponsored healthcare systems may cause decreased demand for our products and services and increased competition which could result in lower sales volume and downward pressure on the prices for our products longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply we have previously experienced delays in collecting government receivables in certain countries in western europe due to economic conditions and we may experience similar delays in the future in these and other countries or regions experiencing financial problems 

the medical technology industry is very competitive 

we are a global company that faces significant competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies with multiple product lines some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines nontraditional entrants such as technology companies are also entering into the healthcare industry some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we face competition across all our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features clinical or economic outcomes product quality availability price services and other factors in addition we face changing customer preferences and requirements including increased customer demand for more environmentallyfriendly products as well as changes in the ways health care services are delivered including the transition of more care to nonacute settings 

the medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change and discovery and frequent product introductions the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology that provide better features pricing or clinical outcomes or economic value may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations has also created pricing pressure particularly in developing markets 

the medical technology industry has also experienced a significant amount of consolidation resulting in companies with greater market presence health care systems and other health care companies are also consolidating resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies as a result competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry 

could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

a substantial amount of our revenues are derived from international operations and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the us in the future the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 7 management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks 

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products including medicare medicaid and comparable foreign programs as well as private payors the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources and by country may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states or abroad changes in coverage or reimbursement rates by private payers or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business 

the reinstatement of the ppacas medical device tax may adversely affect our results of operations 

the ppaca imposes on medical device manufacturers such as bd a 23 excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices while the excise tax has been suspended until the end of 2019 absent further legislative action it will be reinstated in 2020 which would adversely affect our results of operation 

cost volatility could adversely affect our operations 

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials components freight and energy that increases the costs of producing and distributing our products new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components in particular we purchase supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products and any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results increases in oil prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs we may not be able to offset any increases in these operational costs 

breaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations including sensitive personal information and proprietary or confidential information in addition some of our products include information technology that collects data regarding patients and patient therapy on behalf of our customers and some connect to our systems for maintenance purposes our information technology systems have been subjected to attack via malicious code execution and cyber or phishing attacks and we have experienced instances of unauthorized access to our systems in the past and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future in addition to our own information in the course of doing business we sometimes store information with third parties that could be subject to these types of attacks 

cyberattacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being accessed or stolen likewise we could suffer disruption of our operations and other significant negative consequences including increased costs for security measures or remediation diversion of management attention and adverse impact on our relationships with vendors business partners and customers unauthorized tampering adulteration or interference with our products may also create issues with product functionality that could result in a loss of data risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions cyberattacks could result in unauthorized access to our systems and products which could also result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation while we will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and work with government authorities to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated frequent and adaptive there can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development new product development requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products and technologies successfully complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 

we cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

we may seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky and the integration of any newlyacquired business requires significant effort and management attention the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 

the international operations of our business may subject us to certain business risks 

a substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the united states and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets especially in emerging markets our foreign operations subject us to certain risks including among others the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above the effects of local economic and political conditions competition from local companies trade protectionism and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders us relations with the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements local product preferences and product requirements longer payment terms for account receivables than we experience in the us difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations changes to international trade agreements and treaties changes in tax laws weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries and import or export licensing requirements the success of our operations outside the united states also depends in part on our ability to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and sales and distribution networks 

in addition our international operations are governed by the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws outside the us global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more enforcement proceedings by us and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties while we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws our international operations which often involve customer relationships with foreign 

governments create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees consultants sales agents or distributors any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities and negatively affect our reputation 

changes in us policy regarding international trade including import and export regulation and international trade agreements could also negatively impact our business in 2018 the us imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from china and certain other countries which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries additional tariffs imposed by the us on a broader range of imports or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we may not be able to offset or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

the june 2016 referendum result in the united kingdom “uk” to exit the european union “eu” commonly known as “brexit” and the subsequent commencement of the official withdrawal process by the uk government in march 2017 has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the uk and the eu until the terms of the uk’s exit from the eu in march 2019 are determined including any transition period it is difficult to predict its impact it is possible that the withdrawal could among other things affect the legal and regulatory environments to which our businesses are subject impact trade between the uk and the eu and other parties and create economic and political uncertainty in the region 

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our business 

we sell products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and agencies in other countries the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable for instance there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods the availability of governmental research funding may be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

we purchase many different types of raw materials and components used in our products certain raw materials and components are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons certain raw materials and components are purchased from sole suppliers the price and supply of these materials and components may be impacted or disrupted for reasons beyond our control while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants damage to one or more of these facilities from weather or natural disasters or issues in our manufacturing process equipment failure or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture these products resulting in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers 

we are subject to lawsuits 

we are or have been a defendant in a number of lawsuits including purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations product liability claims which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multidistrict litigation proceedings including claims relating to our hernia repair implant products surgical continence and pelvic organ prolapse products for women and vena cava filter products and suits alleging patent infringement we have also been subject to government subpoenas seeking information with respect to alleged violations of law including in connection with federal andor state healthcare programs such as medicare or medicaid andor sales and marketing practices such as the civil investigative demands received by bd and bard a more detailed description of the foregoing is contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we could be subject to additional lawsuits or governmental investigations in the future reserves established for estimated losses with respect to legal proceedings do not represent an exact calculation of our actual liability but instead represent our estimate of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and our underlying loss reserve estimates additional reserves may be established from timetotime also in some instances we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges materially in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor liquidity 

with respect to our existing product liability litigation we believe that some settlements and judgments as well as legal defense costs may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies or in some circumstances indemnification obligations to us from other parties however amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages andor costs in addition there is no guarantee that insurers or other parties will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available for certain product liability claims or lawsuits the company does not maintain or has limited remaining insurance coverage and we may not be able to obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms or at all that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 

we are subject to extensive regulation 

our operations are global and are affected by complex state federal and international laws relating to healthcare environmental protection antitrust anticorruption marketing fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws export control employment privacy and other areas violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and in some cases exclusion from participation in health care programs such as medicare and medicaid environmental laws particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases are also becoming more stringent throughout the world which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers or result in liability to bd the enactment of additional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations 

we are also subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of our products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources and these have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda for supporting data for submissions the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable fda and other regulatory requirements continue to be met following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production marketing or sale of our 

products and result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances closure of manufacturing sites seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation more stringent oversight by the fda and other agencies in recent years has resulted in increased enforcement activity which increases the compliance risk for us and other companies in our industry 

as a result of the carefusion acquisition we are operating under a consent decree with the fda that was entered into by carefusion in 2009 that affects our infusion pump business in the united states we are also currently operating under two warning letters issued by the fda for more information regarding the consent decree and warning letters see “regulation” under item 1 business 

in addition the european union “eu” has adopted the eu medical device regulation the “eu mdr” and the in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have until may 2020 to meet the requirements of the eu mdr and until may 2022 to meet the eu ivdr complying with the requirements of these regulations will require us to incur significant expenditures failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements 

we are also subject to laws in the us and elsewhere regarding privacy and the protection of personal information for instance the eu has also adopted the general data protection regulation gdpr which will apply to personal data involved in our operations in the eu or products and services that we offer to eu users involving personal data the gdpr creates a range of new compliance obligations that could require us to change our existing business practices policies and significantly increases financial penalties for noncompliance 

defects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects component failures unapproved or improper use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or as required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers enforcement actions andor investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of postmarket approval requirements 

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 

many of our businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property assets these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position in addition competitors may seek to invalidate patents on our products or claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property which could result in a loss of competitive advantage or the payment of significant legal fees damage awards and past or future royalties as well as injunctions against future sales of our products we also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the us which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

natural disasters war and other events could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

natural disasters including pandemics war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts and actions taken by the united states and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and areas outside of the united states in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers 

we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 

our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected 

risks relating to our acquisition of bard 

the integration of the bard business may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the bard acquisition may not be realized 

the success of the bard acquisition including anticipated benefits and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our legacy business with the business of bard the integration of bard’s business with our existing business is a complex costly and timeconsuming process it is possible that a number of factors including without limitation the loss of key employees higher than expected costs diversion of management attention and resources the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition if we experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the bard acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected these integration matters could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period following the acquisition in addition the actual cost savings of the bard acquisition could be less than anticipated 

the future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations 

following the completion of the bard acquisition the size of our business has increased significantly our ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend in part upon management’s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of the two companies but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the bard acquisition 

we will incur substantial expenses related to the integration of bard 

we incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the bard integration related to formulating and implementing integration plans including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the bard integration although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset integrationrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

in connection with the bard acquisition we incurred significant additional indebtedness which could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and will increase our interest expense 

we have substantially increased our indebtedness in connection with the bard acquisition through the incurrence of new indebtedness to finance the acquisition and the assumption of bard’s existing indebtedness in comparison to our indebtedness on a recent historical basis this could have the effect of among other things reducing our flexibility to respond to business challenges and opportunities and increasing our interest expense 

the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the bard acquisition and thus the demands on our cash resources are greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the bard acquisition the increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the bard acquisition may also reduce funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness as it becomes due and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels in addition certain of the indebtedness incurred in connection with the bard acquisition bears interest at variable interest rates if interest rates increase variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements which could further adversely affect our cash flows if we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the bard acquisition or if the financial performance as a combined company does not meet current expectations then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted 

in addition our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future or that we will be able to maintain our current rating furthermore our combined company’s credit ratings were lowered following the bard acquisition including below “investment grade” by moody’s investors service inc which may further increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital 

moreover in the future we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness acquisitions or other general corporate requirements our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

we may not be able to service all of our indebtedness 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments however our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations of the combined company and to utilize other methods to make scheduled payments will depend on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control there can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures seek additional capital sell assets or refinance our indebtedness any such action may not be successful and we may be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred in connection with the bard acquisition impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred in connection with the bard acquisition contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to among other things have liens on our property andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person engage in certain transactions with affiliates and change the nature of our business in addition the agreements also require us to comply with certain financial covenants including financial ratios our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other 

agreements containing crossdefault provisions under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations 

the mandatory convertible preferred stock underlying the depositary shares issued in connection with the financing of the bard transaction may adversely affect the market price of bd common stock 

the market price of bd common stock is likely to be influenced by the mandatory convertible preferred stock underlying the depositary shares issued in connection with the financing for the bard transaction the market price of bd common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by

summary of financial results 

worldwide revenues in 2018  of 15983 billion  increased 322 from the prioryear period the increase reflected an impact of almost 245 resulting from the acquisition of bard revenue growth in 2018  also reflected volume growth of over 55 a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 23  and an unfavorable impact of price of approximately 03 volume growth in 2018  attributable to the medical and life sciences segments was as follows 

 

we continue to invest in research and development geographic expansion and new product market programs to drive further revenue and profit growth our ability to sustain our longterm growth will depend on a number of factors including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion develop innovative new products and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness while the economic environment for the healthcare industry and healthcare utilization in the united states is generally stable destabilization in the future could adversely impact our businesses additionally macroeconomic challenges in europe continue to constrain healthcare utilization although we currently view the environment as stable in emerging markets the company’s growth is dependent primarily on government funding for healthcare systems in addition pricing pressure exists globally which could adversely impact our businesses 

our financial position remains strong with cash flows from operating activities totaling 2865 billion  in 2018  at september 30 2018  we had 13 billion  in cash and equivalents and shortterm investments including restricted cash we continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends during fiscal year 2018  we paid cash dividends of 927 million  

each reporting period we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period a weaker us dollar in 2018  compared with 2017  resulted in a favorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenue and earnings during 2018  we evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currencyneutral basis which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as 

exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currencyneutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods foreign currencyneutral fxn information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a foreign currencyneutral basis as one measure to evaluate our performance we calculate foreign currencyneutral percentages by converting our currentperiod local currency financial results using the priorperiod foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our currentperiod results these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap results on a foreign currencyneutral basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap 

results of operations 

medical segment 

the following summarizes medical revenues by organizational unit 



nm denotes that the percentage is not meaningful 

 medical segment growth in 2018  was favorably impacted by the inclusion of revenues associated with certain bard products within the medication delivery solutions unit beginning on january 1 2018 the medical segments underlying revenue growth was largely driven by sales of the medication delivery solutions units vascular access and vascular care products as well as by the medication management solutions units installations of dispensing and infusion systems revenue growth in the medication management solutions unit was partially offset by the unfavorable impact in the first half of 2018  of a modification to dispensing equipment lease contracts with customers which took place in april 2017 as a result of the lease modification substantially all new lease contracts are accounted for as operating leases with revenue recognized over the agreement term rather than upon the placement of capital the medical segment’s underlying growth also reflected sales of the pharmaceutical systems units prefillable products and the diabetes care units pen needles 

medical segment revenue growth in 2017  was driven by the medication delivery solutions units sales of infusion disposables products particularly in international markets and the pharmaceutical systems unit’s sales of selfinjection systems revenue growth in 2017  also reflected the diabetes care units increased sales of pen needles in the united states and emerging markets international growth in the diabetes care unit was impacted by weaker revenues in europe primarily in the united kingdom due to increasing pressure from government 

payers as part of austerity measures medical segment revenues in 2017 were unfavorably impacted by the divestiture of the respiratory solutions business and the modification to dispensing equipment lease contracts in the medication management solutions unit as discussed above in 2017  revenues in the medication management solutions unit included 151 million of revenues relating to amended preexisting lease contracts 

medical segment operating income was as follows 



 the medical segments operating income was driven by its performance with respect to gross profit margin and operating expenses as discussed in greater detail below 

• the medical segments gross profit margin in 2018  was lower as compared with 2017 primarily due to the expense related to amortization of intangible assets acquired in the bard transaction and the expense related to the recognition of a fair value stepup adjustment relating to bards inventory on the acquisition date the medical segments gross profit margin in 2018  was also unfavorably impacted by charges to write down the value of fixed assets primarily in the diabetes care unit higher raw material costs and pricing pressures these unfavorable impacts to the medical segments gross margin were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous improvement projects which enhanced the efficiency of our operations and favorable product mix impact relating to the bard products reported within the segment the medical segments gross profit margin in 2017  was higher as compared with 2016 primarily due to the divestiture of the respiratory solutions business which had products with relatively lower gross profit margins gross profit margin in 2017  also reflected lower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous improvement projects 

• selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2018  was lower compared with 2017  which primarily reflected a reduction in the general and administrative costs allocated to the segment as noted above selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2017  was lower compared with 2016  primarily due to the divestiture of the respiratory solutions business as this business generally had a lower operating margin 

• research and development expense as a percentage of revenues was higher in 2018  which reflected increased investment in new products and platforms research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2017  reflected ongoing investment in new products and platforms but was lower compared with 2016  as expense in 2016  included a onetime payment relating to one of the segments ongoing projects 

life sciences segment

the life sciences segments revenue growth in 2018  was driven by growth across all three of its organizational units the diagnostic systems units revenues were primarily driven by sales of core microbiology products as well as continued strength in sales of the units bd max tm  molecular platform revenue growth in the diagnostic systems unit also reflected a more severe influenza season in 2018 compared with 2017 the life sciences segments 2018  revenue growth was also driven by the biosciences units sales of research reagents and recently launched instruments growth in the preanalytical systems unit reflected global sales of core products 

the life sciences segments 2017  revenues reflected growth in global sales of the preanalytical systems units core products and growth in sales of the diagnostics systems units microbiology and molecular platforms particularly in emerging markets the segment’s 2017  revenue growth was also driven by increased biosciences unit sales particularly in developed markets

operating expenses in 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows 



selling and administrative 

the increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2018  compared with 2017  was primarily attributable to the inclusion of bard which had a higher selling and administrative spending profile in 2018  results selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2017  was relatively flat compared with 2016  

research and development 

  

research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2018  was relatively flat compared with 2017  spending in 2018  2017  and 2016  reflected our continued commitment to invest in new products and platforms spending in 2018  also included certain writedown charges in the biosciences unit as further discussed above research and development expense as a percentage of revenues was slightly lower in 2017  compared to expense in 2016  which reflected increased investment in 2016  in high growth opportunities 

acquisitions and other restructurings 

costs relating to acquisitions and other restructurings in 2018  included restructuring costs incurred due to our acquisition of bard and to a lesser extent restructuring costs related to our fiscal year 2015 acquisition of carefusion and other portfolio rationalization initiatives integration costs incurred in 2018  were attributable to both the bard and carefusion acquisitions transaction costs were incurred in 2018  and 2017  primarily due to our acquisition of bard substantially all of the integration and restructuring costs in 2017  and 2016  were attributable to the carefusion acquisition and other portfolio rationalization initiatives restructuring costs in 2016  included a 214 million charge recorded to impair capitalized internaluse software assets held for sale as a result of information technology function transformation efforts for further disclosures regarding the costs relating to acquisitions and other restructurings refer to notes 7 9 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

net interest expense 



the increase in interest expense in 2018  compared with 2017  reflected higher levels of debt for the fullyear period due to our issuances of senior unsecured us notes during the third quarter of 2017 the increase in interest expense in 2017  also reflected interest costs related to these issuances of senior unsecured us notes as well as bridge financing commitment fees of 79 million additional disclosures regarding our financing arrangements and debt instruments are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the decrease in interest income in 2018  reflected lower cash levels subsequent to the closing of the bard acquisition in the first quarter of 2018  the increase in interest income in 2017 compared with 2016  primarily reflected higher levels of cash on hand as a result of our third quarter issuances of debt and equity securities in advance of closing our acquisition of bard 

income taxes 

the income tax rates in 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows 



the increase in the effective income tax rate in 2018 reflected certain effects of new us tax legislation that was enacted in december 2017 as previously discussed above we recognized additional tax expense in 2018  of 640 million based upon our determinations regarding the effects of the new legislation the effective income tax rate in 2018  also reflected a less favorable benefit from specified items in the currentyear period the decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2017 largely reflected the more favorable tax impact from specified items recognized in 2017  compared with 2016  as well as the tax benefits recorded upon the settlement of sharebased compensation awards in 2017  the sharebased compensationrelated tax benefits were recognized in connection with bds adoption of new accounting requirements relating to the income tax effects of sharebased compensation awards additional disclosures regarding this adoption are provided in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

financial instrument market risk 

we selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations the counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign exchange risk 

bd and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout europe greater asia canada and latin america we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency these payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions we hedge substantially all such exposures primarily through the use of forward contracts we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations including sales to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period from time to time we may purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future earnings resulting from adverse 

foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions we did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2018  or 2017  

derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value for foreign currency derivatives market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities 

with respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2018  and 2017  the impact that changes in the us dollar would have on pretax earnings was estimated as follows 



these calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments 

interest rate risk 

our primary interest rate risk relates to us dollar borrowings which are partially offset by us dollar cash investments when managing interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments we may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interestbearing investments in tandem since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure for interest rate derivative instruments fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using marketbased observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities 

the impact that changes in interest rates would have on interest rate derivatives outstanding at september 30 2018  and 2017  as well as the effect that changes in interest rates would have on our earnings or cash flows over a oneyear period based upon our overall interest rate exposure were estimated as follows 



nm denotes that the impact was not meaningful due to immateriality 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows in 2018  2017  and 2016  



net cash flows from operating activities 

the fiscal year 2018  2017  and 2016  changes in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and other noncash items the fiscal year 2018  change in operating assets and liabilities was a net source of cash and primarily reflected higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily due to higher income taxes payable as a result of the 

new us tax legislation discussed above as well as lower levels of inventory partially offset by higher levels of trade receivables the change in cash flows from operating activities in 2018  also reflected a change to deferred tax asset and liability balances which were remeasured under the recently enacted tax legislation which is further discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the change in cash flows from operating activities in 2018 additionally reflected a 303 million gain on the sale of our remaining interest in the vyaire medical venture as well as discretionary cash contributions of 287 million  to fund our pension obligation the fiscal year 2017  change in operating assets and liabilities was a net use of cash and primarily reflected higher levels of prepaid expenses trade receivables and inventory partially offset by higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses net cash provided by operating activities in 2017  reflected an adjustment for the noncash charge resulting from the modification to our dispensing equipment lease contracts with customers as previously discussed as noted above both 2018  and 2017  reflected losses recorded upon our extinguishment of certain longterm notes which are included within other net  the previously discussed noncash charge recorded to impair capitalized internaluse software assets held for sale is included within other net  in 2016  net cash provided by operating activities in 2016  was reduced by changes in the pension obligation resulting primarily from a discretionary cash contribution of 100 million 

net cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures 

our investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities and support our strategy of geographic expansion with select investments in growing markets capital expenditures of 895 million  727 million  693 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively primarily related to manufacturing capacity expansions details of spending by segment are contained in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

acquisitions of businesses 

cash outflows for acquisitions in 2018  primarily related to our acquisition of bard cash outflows for acquisitions in 2017  included payments for acquisitions which were immaterial both individually and in the aggregate for further discussion refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

divestitures of businesses 

cash inflows relating to business divestitures in 2018  and 2017 were 534 million  and 165 million  respectively for further discussion refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data net cash flows from investing activities in 2016  included 158 million of proceeds from the sales of noncore assets 

net cash flows from financing activities 

net cash from financing activities in 2018  2017  and 2016  included the following significant cash flows 



additional disclosures regarding the equity and debtrelated financing activities detailed above are provided in notes 3 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

debtrelated activities 

certain measures relating to our total debt were as follows 



 

the increase in shortterm debt as a percentage of total debt at september 30 2018  was primarily driven by the reclassification of certain notes from longterm to shortterm the decrease in shortterm debt as a percentage of total debt at september 30 2017 was largely driven by our issuance of 9675 billion of senior unsecured us notes during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 additional disclosures regarding our debt instruments are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

cash and shortterm investments 

at september 30 2018  total worldwide cash and shortterm investments were 1253 billion  including restricted cash which was primarily held in jurisdictions outside of the united states 

financing facilities 

in may 2017 we entered into a threeyear 225 billion senior unsecured term loan facility we used the 225 billion of proceeds drawn from this facility in december 2017 to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the bard acquisition as well as the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition in september 2018 we entered into a 364day 750 million senior unsecured term loan facility we used 230 million of proceeds drawn from this facility in september 2018 to repay all borrowings outstanding under the threeyear term loan facility discussed above borrowings outstanding under the new 364day term loan facility were 710 million at september 30 2018  

also in may 2017 we entered into a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility which became effective upon the closing of the bard acquisition and which provides borrowing of up to 225 billion this facility will expire in december 2022 and replaced the 15 billion syndicated credit facility we previously had in place with an expiration date of january 2022 we will be able to issue up to 100 million in letters of credit under this new revolving credit facility and it also includes a provision that enables bd subject to additional commitments made by the lenders to access up to an additional 500 million in financing through the facility for a maximum aggregate commitment of 275 billion we used proceeds from this facility to redeem or repurchase certain of bards outstanding senior unsecured notes that were assumed upon the closing of the acquisition and we will also use proceeds from this facility to fund general corporate needs there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at september 30 2018  

the agreements for both the new 364day term loan and revolving credit facility contained the following financial covenants we were in compliance with these covenants as of september 30 2018  



 we also have informal lines of credit outside the united states the company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of september 30 2018  we may from time to time sell certain trade receivable assets to third parties as we manage working capital over the normal course of our business activities 

access to capital and credit ratings 

our corporate credit ratings with the rating agencies standard  poors ratings services sp moodys investor service moodys and fitch ratings fitch were as follows at september 30 2018  



upon our closing the bard acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 sp lowered our corporate credit rating from the previous rating of bbb also upon the acquisitions closing moodys downgraded our corporate credit and commercial paper ratings from the previous ratings of baa2 and p2 respectively the rating assigned to our corporate debt by fitch was unchanged by the closing of the acquisition 

lower corporate debt ratings and further downgrades of our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing we believe that given our debt ratings our financial management policies our ability to generate cash flow and the noncyclical geographically diversified nature of our businesses we would have access to additional shortterm and longterm capital should the need arise a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change 

contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future the table below sets forth bd’s significant contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of september 30 2018  



  



critical accounting policies 

the following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

while our revenue is generally the result of product sales some of our sales transactions qualify as multipleelement arrangements which require us to identify separate units of accounting within the arrangement and allocate the transaction consideration across these separate accounting units for arrangements that include software and nonsoftware elements the transaction consideration is allocated to the software elements as a group as well as to the individual nonsoftware elements that have been separately identified the identification of accounting units and the allocation of total transaction consideration for multipleelement arrangements may be subjective and requires a degree of management judgment management’s judgments relative to multipleelement arrangements may affect the timing of revenue recognition 

transaction consideration for separately identified nonsoftware units of accounting within an arrangement is recognized upon the completion of each deliverable based on its relative selling price when applying the relative selling price method the selling price of each deliverable is determined based upon the following hierarchy of evidence vendorspecific objective evidence which is generally based upon historical prices in standalone transactions thirdparty evidence which is generally based on market data on sales of similar products and services if available and management’s best estimate of selling price management’s best estimate of selling price is generally based upon the following considerations standalone sales prices established price lists costs to produce profit margins for similar products market conditions and customer stratification 

the revenue allocated to equipment or instruments in multipleelement arrangements is recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer the revenue allocated to extended warranty contracts and software maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized as these deliverables are performed under the arrangement the majority of deferred revenue relating to extended warranty contracts is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period 

accounting for salestype leases 

in april 2017 in conjunction with the implementation of a new gotomarket business model for our dispensing business within our medication management solutions unit we amended new and existing leases to provide a limited return option prior to the amendment these leases were accounted for as salestype leases in accordance with accounting standards codification 840 leases as the typical noncancellable lease term of 5 years exceeded 75 of the equipment’s estimated useful life and the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeded 90 of the equipment’s fair value as salestype leases we recognized revenue upon installation of equipment at a customer site based on the present value of the minimum lease payments as a result of the contract amendment the amended lease term was shortened and as a result the majority of leases no longer met the criteria for recognition as salestype leases accordingly the leases were classified as operating leases as of the modification date and revenue is generally recognized ratably over the lease term 

accounting for software products 

we sell and lease products with embedded software and as such we must evaluate these products to determine if industryspecific revenue recognition requirements apply to these sales transactions this evaluation process is often complex and subject to significant judgment if software is considered not essential to the nonsoftware elements of a product but is considered more than incidental to a product as a whole the product’s software elements must be separated from its nonsoftware elements under the requirements relating to multipleelement arrangements the product’s software elements must be accounted for under software industryspecific revenue recognition requirements and the application of these requirements may significantly affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized 

while we have determined that the software embedded in the following product groupings is more than incidental to the products as a whole the nonsoftware elements ie hardware and software elements work together to deliver the essential functionality of these products as a whole as such the accounting for these product offerings does not fall within the scope of software industryspecific accounting requirements 

 our standalone software application sales and any related postcontract support related to these sales are accounted for under the software industryspecific revenue recognition requirements 

impairment of assets 

goodwill and inprocess research and development assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with finite lives including developed technology and other longlived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or 

one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units generally represent one 

level below reporting segments potential impairment of goodwill is generally identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value our annual goodwill impairment test performed on july 1 2018  did not result in any impairment charges as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

we generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with bd’s business plans the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and potentially result in different impacts to bd’s results of operations actual results may differ from management’s estimates 

income taxes 

bd maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 

bd conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions our past audit experience with similar situations and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters bd’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if upon resolution with taxing authorities we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

the us tax cuts and job act the act” was enacted into law on december 22 2017 this law reduces the us statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings bd has a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the act to finalize the recognition of the related tax impacts the final impact of the act may differ from the provisional amounts recognized in fiscal year 2018 possibly materially due to among other things developing interpretations of the act or any updates or changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the impacts 

we have historically asserted indefinite reinvestment of the earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries outside the united states the act eliminated certain material tax effects on the repatriation of cash to the united states future repatriation of cash and other property held by our foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to us federal income tax as a result after reevaluation of the permanent reinvestment assertion we are no longer permanently reinvested with respect to its historic unremitted foreign earnings as of september 30 2018 additional disclosures regarding our accounting for income taxes are provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

contingencies 

we are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including without limitation product liability antitrust and environmental matters as further discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses we establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries a determination of the amount of accruals if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue and when appropriate is developed after consultation with outside counsel the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters we record expected recoveries from product liability insurance carriers or other parties when those recoveries are probable and collectible 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows 

benefit plans 

we have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations these benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate pension benefit costs also include an assumption for the expected return on plan assets these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

the discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date september 30 specifically for the us pension plan we will use a discount rate of 426 for 2019  which was based on an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date to calculate the pension expense in 2019  we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2019  are provided in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption although reviewed each year changes less frequently due to the longterm nature of the assumption this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date rather it is used only in the calculation of pension expense to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider many factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results benchmark data expected returns on various plan asset classes as well as current and expected asset allocations we will use a longterm expected rate of return on 

plan assets assumption of 725 for the us pension plan in 2019  we believe our discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our us pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows 

 sharebased compensation 

compensation cost relating to sharebased payment transactions is recognized in net income using a fair value measurement method all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options are recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense based on their fair values over the vesting period of the awards we determine the fair value of certain sharebased awards using a latticebased binomial option valuation model that incorporates certain assumptions such as the riskfree interest rate expected volatility expected dividend yield and expected life of the options see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

bd and its representatives may from time to time make certain forwardlooking statements in publicly released materials both written and oral including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission press releases and our reports to shareholders forwardlooking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan” “expect” “believe” “intend” “will” “may” “anticipate” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with among other things discussions of future operations and financial performance including volume growth sales and earnings per share growth and cash flows and statements regarding our strategy for growth future product development regulatory approvals competitive position and expenditures all statements that address our future operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forwardlooking statements 

forwardlooking statements are and will be based on management’s thencurrent views and assumptions regarding future events developments and operating performance and speak only as of their dates investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements furthermore we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information future events and developments or otherwise except as required by applicable law or regulations 

the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements for further discussion of certain of these factors see item 1a risk factors in this report 







 the foregoing list sets forth many but not all of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forwardlooking statements investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties

foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues bd believes its activities in some countries outside the united states involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein as well as the economic environment local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties see further discussion of this risk in item 1a risk factors 

distribution 

bd’s products are marketed and distributed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to endusers by bd and independent sales representatives order backlog is not material to bd’s business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock bd’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the medication and procedural solutions organizational unit and diagnostic products in the diagnostic systems organizational unit which relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza 

raw materials and components 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials and components including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products bd seeks to ensure continuity of supply by securing multiple options for sourcing however there are situations where raw materials and components are only available from one supplier which are referred to as sole sourced the use of sole sourced materials and components may be due to sourcing of proprietary andor patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product in other cases while a raw material or component can be sourced from multiple manufacturers only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance cost or other considerations in order to provide alternate sources bd must complete a rigorous qualification process which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval if clinical trials are not required this qualification process can take 318 months depending on the criticality of the change when clinical trials are required this process may lengthen the qualification phase from one to three years bd continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and components and maintains business continuity plans with our suppliers bd’s continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities maintaining contingency stock internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts while bd works closely with its suppliers no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful and there may be events that cause supply interruption reduction or termination that adversely impacts bd’s ability to manufacture and sell certain products 

research and development 

bd conducts its research and development “rd” activities at its operating units and at bd technologies in research triangle park north carolina the majority of bd’s rd activities are conducted in north america outside north america bd primarily conducts rd activities in china france india ireland and singapore bd also collaborates with certain universities medical centers and other entities on rd programs and retains individual consultants and partners to support its efforts in specialized fields bd spent approximately 774 million 828 million and 632 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended september 30 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

intellectual property and licenses 

bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bd’s business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bd’s business as a whole or to any business segment 

competition 

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment in addition the entry into the market of lowcost manufacturers are creating increased pricing pressures some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs 

bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement in support of its core strategies 

thirdparty reimbursement 

a majority of bd’s customers rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures products and services they provide our technologies are subject to worldwide regulations regarding reimbursement developed by government agencies including the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms in the united states the national health service in the united kingdom the joint federal committee in germany the commission d’evaluation des produits et prestations in france the ministry for health labor and welfare in japan the ministry of health and the national development and reform commission in china among many others in addition our technologies are also subject to reimbursement policies issued by private insurance companies and managed care organizations 

bd is actively engaged in identifying and communicating value propositions of its products for payer provider and patient stakeholders and it employs various efforts and resources to attempt to positively impact coverage coding and payment pathways however bd has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and payment levels for bd products the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer’s discretion as bd’s product offerings are diverse across a variety of healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment pathways that impact the decisions of healthcare providers regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products therefore changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products in any given country for any given product 

as government programs seek to expand healthcare coverage for their citizens they have at the same time sought to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures products or services many thirdparty payers have developed specific payment and delivery mechanisms to support these cost control efforts and to focus on paying for value these mechanisms include payment reductions pay for performance measures qualitybased performance payments restrictive coverage policies bidding and tender mechanics studies to compare the effectiveness of therapies and use of technology assessments these changes have created an increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective and qualitydriven healthcare 

in addition as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” the us is implementing value based payment methodologies and seeking to create alternative payment models such as bundled payments to continue to drive improved value we see other governments around the world considering similar bundling reform measures including the development of the diagnosis related group “drg” as a payment mechanism to drive toward quality and resource based reimbursement 

regulation 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

bd actively maintains fdaiso quality systems that establish standards for its product design manufacturing and distribution processes prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of bd’s quality systems as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials these regulatory controls as well as any changes in fda policies can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

bd also is subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the united states concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws global anticorruption transportation safety and health and customs and exports many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years this appears to be part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the united states 

in addition as part of ppaca the federal government has enacted the sunshine act provisions requiring bd to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals failure to comply with these provisions could result in a range of fines penalties andor other sanctions 

our infusion pump organizational unit is operating under an amended consent decree entered into by carefusion with the fda in 2007 carefusion’s consent decree with the fda related to its alaris™ se infusion pumps in february 2009 carefusion and the fda amended the consent decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for carefusion 303 inc the organizational unit that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the united states the amended consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories 

while this bd organizational unit remains subject to the amended consent decree which includes the requirements of the original consent decree it has made substantial progress in its compliance efforts however we cannot predict the outcome of this matter and the amended consent decree authorizes the fda in the event of any violations in the future to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing infusion pumps recall products and take other actions we may be required to pay damages of 15000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree up to 15 million per year 

we also cannot currently predict whether additional monetary investment will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matter’s ultimate impact on our business we may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because among other things the fda may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree andor we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree as of september 30 2017 we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the amended consent decree and accordingly we have no accruals associated with compliance with the amended consent decree 

for further discussion of risks relating to the regulations to which we are subject see item 1a risk factors

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows 

risks relating to bd 

a downturn in global economic conditions could adversely affect our operations 

deterioration in the global economic environment particularly in emerging markets and countries with governmentsponsored healthcare systems may cause decreased demand for our products and services and increased competition which could result in lower sales volume and downward pressure on the prices for our products longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply we have also previously experienced delays in collecting government receivables in certain countries in western europe due to economic conditions and we may experience similar delays in the future in these and other countries or regions experiencing financial problems 

the medical technology industry is very competitive 

we are a global company that faces significant competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies with multiple product lines some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines we face competition across all our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features clinical or economic outcomes product quality price services and other factors in addition we face changing customer preferences and requirements including increased customer demand for more environmentallyfriendly products 

the medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change and discovery the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations has also created pricing pressure particularly in developing markets 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

a substantial amount of our revenues are derived from international operations and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the us in the future the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 7 management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks 

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources and by country may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states or abroad changes in reimbursement rates by private payers or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business 

the reinstatement of the ppacas medical device tax may adversely affect our results of operations 

the ppaca imposes on medical device manufacturers such as bd a 23 excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices while the excise tax has been suspended until the end of 2017 absent further legislative action it will be reinstated in 2018 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation resulting in companies with greater market presence health care systems and other health care companies are also consolidating resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies as a result competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

cost volatility could adversely affect our operations 

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials components freight and energy that increases the costs of producing and distributing our products new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components in particular we purchase supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products and any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results increases in oil prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs we may not be able to offset any increases in these operational costs 

breaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations including sensitive personal information and proprietary or confidential information in addition some of our products include information technology that collects data regarding patients and patient therapy on behalf of our customers and some connect to our systems for maintenance purposes our information technology systems have been subjected to attack via malicious code execution cyber or phishing attacks and we have experienced instances of unauthorized access to our systems in the past and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future in addition to our own information in the course of doing business we sometimes store information with third parties that could be subject to these types of attacks cyberattacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being accessed or stolen likewise we could suffer disruption of our operations and other significant negative consequences including increased costs for security measures or remediation diversion of management attention and adverse impact on our relationships with vendors business partners and customers unauthorized tampering adulteration or interference with our products may also create issues with product functionality that could result in a loss of data risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions cyberattacks could result in unauthorized access to our systems and products which could also result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation while we will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect the company against unauthorized access to our systems and work with government authorities to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated frequent and adaptive there can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development new product development requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products and technologies successfully complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 

we cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

we may seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky and the integration of any newlyacquired business requires significant effort and management attention the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 

the international operations of our business may subject us to certain business risks 

a substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the united states and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets especially in emerging markets our foreign operations subject us to certain risks including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above the effects of local economic and political conditions us relations with the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements local product preferences and product requirements longer payment terms for account receivables than we experience in the us difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations differing labor regulations potential changes to international trade agreements and treaties changes in tax laws weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries import or export licensing requirements trade protection measures and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders the success of our operations outside the united states depends in part on our ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and sales and distribution networks 

in addition our international operations are governed by the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws outside the us global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more enforcement proceedings by us and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties while we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws our international operations which often involve customer relationships with foreign governments create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees consultants sales agents or distributors any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities and negatively affect our reputation 

under the us tax code we may also be subject to additional taxation to the extent we repatriate earnings from our foreign operations to the us in the event we require more capital in the united states than is generated by our us operations to fund acquisitions or other activities and elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rate may be higher as a result recently in the united states there have been legislative proposals to tax profits that are earned abroad these and other proposals for fundamental us corporate tax reform if enacted could have a material impact on our financial results 

the june 2016 referendum result in the united kingdom “uk” to exit the european union “eu” commonly known as “brexit” and the subsequent triggering by the uk government in march 2017 of article 50 of the lisbon treaty which commenced the uk’s official withdrawal process from the eu has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the uk and the eu following the referendum there was a significant decline in the value of the british pound compared to the us dollar and continued volatility in exchange rates and economic conditions is expected as the uk negotiates its exit from the eu until the terms of the uk’s exit from the eu are determined it is difficult to predict its impact but it is possible that the withdrawal could among other things affect the legal and regulatory schemes to which our businesses are subject impact trade between the uk and the eu and other parties and create economic and political uncertainty in the region 

there have also been recent proposals for the us to significantly modify or withdraw from certain existing international trade agreements including the north american free trade agreement while we cannot predict whether any such changes will be implemented it is possible that changes to international trade agreements could materially impact our business 

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our business 

we sell products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and agencies in other countries the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable for instance there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods the availability of governmental research funding may be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

we purchase many different types of raw materials and components used in our products certain raw materials and components are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons we elect to purchase certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers the supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of reasons including economic conditions as described above while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants damage to one or more of these facilities from weather or natural disasters or issues in our manufacturing process equipment failure or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture these products resulting in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers in particular damage to our manufacturing facilities in puerto rico resulting from hurricane maria in september 2017 could adversely impact our revenue and earnings results for fiscal year 2018 

we are subject to lawsuits 

we are or have been a defendant in a number of lawsuits including purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and suits alleging patent infringement and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to extensive regulation 

our operations are global and are affected by complex state federal and international laws relating to healthcare environmental protection antitrust anticorruption marketing fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws export control employment and other areas violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and in some cases exclusion from participation in health care programs such as medicare and medicaid environmental laws particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases are also becoming more stringent throughout the world which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers or result in liability to bd the enactment of additional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations 

we are also subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of our products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources and these have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda for supporting data for submissions the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable fda and other regulatory requirements continue to be met following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production marketing or sale of our products and result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances closure of manufacturing sites seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation more stringent oversight by the fda and other agencies in recent years has resulted in increased enforcement activity which increases the compliance risk for us and other companies in our industry 

as a result of the carefusion acquisition we are operating under a consent decree with the fda that was entered into by carefusion in 2009 that affects our infusion pump business in the united states for more information regarding the consent decree see “regulation” under item 1 “business” 

defects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unapproved use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers enforcement actions andor investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products 

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 

many of our businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property assets these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position in addition competitors may seek to invalidate patents on our products or claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property which could result in a loss of competitive advantage or the payment of significant legal fees damage awards and past or future royalties as well as injunctions against future sales of our products we also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the us which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

natural disasters war and other events could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

natural disasters including pandemics war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts and actions taken by the united states and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and areas outside of the united states in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers 

we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 

our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits and cost savings resulting from our acquisition of carefusion 

while we have realized significant cost savings to date in connection with our acquisition of carefusion in 2015 achieving additional cost synergies may prove more difficult than expected and it is possible that the anticipated cost synergies of the merger may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected 

risks relating to our acquisition of bard 

completion of the bard acquisition is subject to conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived the bard acquisition will not be completed 

the obligations of us and bard to complete the bard acquisition are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period in connection with the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended the “hsr act” the receipt of any authorization or consent from certain other governmental authorities required to be obtained with respect to the merger under applicable foreign antitrust laws approval of the listing on the nyse of shares of our common stock to be issued in the bard acquisition and the absence of an injunction prohibiting the bard acquisition each party’s obligation to complete the bard acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver to the extent permitted under applicable law of certain other customary conditions the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party under the merger agreement subject to the materiality standards set forth in the merger agreement the performance by the other party of its respective obligations under the merger agreement in all material respects and delivery of officer certificates by the other party certifying satisfaction of the two preceding conditions either we or bard may subject to certain exceptions terminate the merger agreement upon mutual consent or if the bard acquisition has not been consummated on or before january 23 2018 or before april 23 2018 if all closing conditions have been satisfied other than the receipt of required competition approvals 

the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the bard acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring if the bard acquisition is not completed our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the bard acquisition we will be subject to a number of risks including the following 



 in addition if the bard acquisition is not completed we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the bard acquisition or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement the materialization of any of these risks could materially and adversely impact our ongoing business 

similarly any delay in completing the bard acquisition could among other things result in additional transaction costs loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the bard acquisition and cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the bard acquisition is successfully completed within its expected timeframe there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the bard acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that the bard acquisition will be consummated 

in order to complete the bard acquisition we and bard must make certain governmental filings and obtain certain governmental authorizations and if such filings and authorizations are not made or granted or are granted with conditions completion of the bard acquisition may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the bard acquisition could be reduced 

although we and bard have agreed in the merger agreement to use reasonable best efforts subject to certain limitations to make certain governmental filings to obtain the required expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hsr act and to obtain any authorization or consent from certain other governmental authorities required to be obtained with respect to the merger under applicable foreign antitrust laws there can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained as a condition to granting termination of the waiting period under the hsr act and to adoption of approvals of the bard acquisition governmental authorities may impose requirements limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after completion of the bard acquisition 

under the terms of the merger agreement subject to certain exceptions we and our subsidiaries are required to accept certain conditions and take certain actions imposed by certain governmental authorities that would apply to or affect the businesses assets or properties of us our subsidiaries or bard and its subsidiaries there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions terms obligations or restrictions and that such conditions terms obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of i delaying completion of the bard acquisition ii imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the bard acquisition or iii otherwise adversely affecting our businesses and results of operations after completion of the bard acquisition in addition we can provide no assurance that these conditions terms obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the bard acquisition 

each party is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed merger is pending which could adversely affect each party’s or the combined company’s business and operations 

in connection with the pendency of the bard acquisition it is possible that some customers suppliers and other persons with whom we or bard have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate change or renegotiate their relationships with us or bard as the case may be as a result of the bard acquisition which could negatively affect our or bard’s respective revenues earnings and cash flows regardless of whether the bard acquisition is completed if the bard acquisition is completed such terminations changes or renegotiations could negatively affect the revenues earnings and cash flows of the combined company these risks may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the bard acquisition 

combining the two companies may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the bard acquisition may not be realized 

we and bard have operated and until the completion of the bard acquisition will continue to operate independently the success of the bard acquisition including anticipated benefits and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our business with the business of bard 

the bard acquisition will involve the integration of bard’s business with our existing business which is a complex costly and timeconsuming process it is possible that the pendency of the bard acquisition andor the integration process could result in material challenges including without limitation 

 many of these factors will be outside of the combined company’s control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially affect the combined company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if we experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the bard acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected these integration matters could have an adverse effect on i each of us and bard during this transition period and ii the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of the bard acquisition in addition the actual cost savings of the bard acquisition could be less than anticipated 

in addition certain risks associated with our industry and business described herein and in our public filings may become more significant following consummation of the bard acquisition including but not limited to risks relating to the continued focus by thirdparty payors on cost containment and government scrutiny of the healthcare industry’s sales and marketing practices various healthcare reform proposals that have emerged on the federal and state levels and in other jurisdictions where the combined company sells its products collective bargaining and labor activity and the integrity of our information systems that are run by third party vendors and such vendors’ ability to maintain their systems and reduce any vulnerability to natural and system disruptions and prevent cyberattacks and other unauthorized access 

the future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the completion of the bard acquisition 

following the completion of the bard acquisition the size of the combined company’s business will be significantly larger than the current size of either our or bard’s respective businesses the combined company’s ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend in part upon management’s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two discrete companies but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the bard acquisition 

the combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the bard acquisition and the integration of bd and bard 

we and bard have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the bard acquisition and combining the operations of the two companies the substantial majority of nonrecurring expenses will be comprised of transaction and regulatory costs related to the bard acquisition 

we also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the bard acquisition and the integration of the two companies’ businesses although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset integrationrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

in connection with the bard acquisition we have incurred significant additional indebtedness and certain of bard’s indebtedness will remain outstanding which could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and will increase our interest expense 

we have substantially increased our indebtedness in connection with the pending bard acquisition through the incurrence of new indebtedness to finance the bard acquisition and following the bard acquisition through the assumption of bard’s existing indebtedness in comparison to our indebtedness on a recent historical basis which could have the effect of among other things reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing our interest expense 

the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the bard acquisition and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the bard acquisition the increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the bard acquisition could also reduce funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness as it becomes due and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels in addition certain of the indebtedness incurred in connection with the bard acquisition bears interest at variable interest rates if interest rates increase variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements which could further adversely affect our cash flows if we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the bard acquisition or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted 

in addition our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future or that we will be able to maintain our current rating furthermore we expect that our combined company’s credit ratings will be lower following the bard acquisition including below “investment grade” by moody’s investors service inc which may further increase the combined company’s future borrowing costs and reduce the combined company’s access to capital 

moreover in the future we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness acquisitions or other general corporate requirements our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot assure you that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

we may not be able to service all of the combined company’s indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful our failure to meet our debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments we expect to be able to meet the estimated cash interest payments on the combined company’s debt following the bard acquisition through a combination of the expected cash flows from operations of the combined company however our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations of the combined company and to utilize other methods to make scheduled payments will depend on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control there can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures seek additional capital sell assets or refinance our indebtedness any such action may not be successful and we may be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the agreements that will govern the indebtedness incurred in connection with the bard acquisition contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that may affect our ability to operate our businesses 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred in connection with the bard acquisition contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to among other things have liens on our property andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person engage in certain transactions with affiliates and change the nature of our business in addition the agreements also require us to comply with certain financial covenants including financial ratios our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations 

uncertainties associated with the bard acquisition may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees of bard or us which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company following the bard acquisition 

we and bard are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our respective officers and other key employees to execute our respective business plans the combined company’s success after the bard acquisition will depend in part upon its ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of us and bard current and prospective employees of us and bard may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the bard acquisition which may materially adversely affect the ability of each of us and bard to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of and after the bard acquisition accordingly no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees of us and bard 

completion of the bard acquisition will trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which bard is a party which may have an adverse impact on the combined company’s business and results of operations 

the completion of the bard acquisition will trigger change in control and other provisions in certain agreements to which bard is a party if we and bard are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages even if we and bard are able to negotiate waivers the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to bard or the combined company any of the foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on the combined company’s business and results of operations 

for example if the ratings of certain of bard’s outstanding senior notes are reduced beyond certain thresholds within certain time periods prior to or following the consummation of the bard acquisition bard could be required to offer to repurchase such notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount of such notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date 

following the consummation of the bard acquisition the combined company will assume certain potential liabilities relating to bard including certain products liability and mass torts claims 

following the consummation of the bard acquisition the combined company will have assumed certain potential liabilities relating to bard including certain products liability and mass tort claims with respect to the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices and related settlement agreements and judgments as of september 30 2017 bard has reported that there are i approximately 25 federal and 185 state lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 205 plaintiffs as well as one putative class action in the united states are currently pending against bard’s hernia repair implant products ii product liability lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 3285 plaintiffs are currently pending against bard in various federal and state jurisdictions with respect to bard’s surgical continence products for women and iii product liability lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 1755 plaintiffs are currently pending against bard in various federal and state jurisdictions with respect to bard’s vena cava filter products 

bard does not maintain or has limited remaining insurance coverage for certain of these claims and the combined company may not be able to obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms or at all that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities moreover in some circumstances adverse events arising from or associated with the design manufacture quality or marketing of our combined company’s products could result in the fda suspending or delaying its review of our applications for new product approvals or imposing post market approval requirements in addition reserves established by bard or the combined company for estimated losses including with respect to these claims do not represent an exact calculation of actual liability but instead represent estimates of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates additional reserves may be established from timetotime and actual losses relating to the assumed bard liabilities may be materially higher or lower than the related reserve any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

sales of shares of bd common stock after the completion of the transaction may cause the market price of bd equity securities to fall 

we will issue a significant number of shares of our common stock in connection with the bard acquisition many bard stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of our common stock they will receive in the bard acquisition other bard stockholders such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers may be required to sell the shares of our common stock that they receive in the bard acquisition such sales of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for our equity securities and may take place promptly following the bard acquisition 

the mandatory convertible preferred stock underlying the depositary shares issued in connection with the financing of the bard transaction may adversely affect the market price of bd common stock 

the market price of bd common stock is likely to be influenced by the mandatory convertible preferred stock underlying the depositary shares issued in connection with the financing for the bard transaction the market price of bd common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by

summary of financial results 

worldwide revenues in 2017  of 12093 billion  decreased 31 from the prioryear period the decrease reflected an approximate 7 reduction in revenues due to the divestiture of the respiratory solutions business in october 2016 volume growth in 2017  of more than 4 for our continuing businesses was partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of less than 1 pricing did not materially impact 2017  revenues additional disclosures regarding our divestiture of the respiratory solutions 

business are provided in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data volume growth in 2017  reflected the following 

 

we continue to invest in research and development geographic expansion and new product promotions to drive further revenue and profit growth our ability to sustain our longterm growth will depend on a number of factors including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion develop innovative new products and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness while the economic environment for the healthcare industry and healthcare utilization in the united states have generally stabilized destabilization in the future could adversely impact our businesses additionally macroeconomic challenges in europe continue to constrain healthcare utilization although we currently view the environment as stable in emerging markets the company’s growth is dependent primarily on government funding for healthcare systems in addition pricing pressure exists for certain geographies and could adversely impact our businesses 

our financial position remains strong with cash flows from operating activities totaling 2550 billion  in 2017  at september 30 2017  we had 142 billion  in cash and equivalents and shortterm investments which included net proceeds raised through registered public offerings of equity securities and debt transactions during the third quarter of approximately 48 billion and 96 billion respectively we continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends during fiscal year 2017  we paid cash dividends of 677 million  we also repurchased approximately 220 million of our common stock during 2017  

each reporting period we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period the ongoing relative strength of the us dollar resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenue and earnings growth during fiscal year 2017 we evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currencyneutral basis which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currencyneutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods foreign currencyneutral fxn information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a foreign currencyneutral basis as one measure to evaluate our performance we calculate foreign currencyneutral percentages by converting our currentperiod local currency financial results using the priorperiod foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our currentperiod results these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap results on a foreign currencyneutral basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap 

results of operations 

medical segment 

the following is a summary of medical revenues by organizational unit 



 

medical segment revenue growth in 2017  was driven by the medication and procedural solutions units sales of infusion disposables products particularly in international markets and the pharmaceutical systems unit’s sales of selfinjection systems revenue growth in 2017  also reflected the diabetes care units increased sales of pen needles in the united states and emerging markets international growth in the diabetes care unit was impacted by weaker revenues in europe primarily in the united kingdom due to increasing pressure from government payers as part of austerity measures medical segment revenues in 2017 were unfavorably impacted by the divestiture of the respiratory solutions business and the modification to dispensing equipment lease contracts with customers in the medication management solutions unit which took place in april 2017 as a result of the lease modification substantially all new lease contracts entered into beginning in april 2017 will be accounted for as operating leases with revenue recognized over the agreement term rather than upon the placement of capital in 2017  revenues in the medication management solutions unit included 151 million of revenues relating to amended preexisting lease contracts 

the medical segments growth in 2016  largely reflected the inclusion of carefusion’s sales for a full fiscal year in 2016  compared with half the fiscal year in 2015  as previously discussed medical segment revenue growth in 2016  additionally reflected the medication and procedural solutions units international sales of safetyengineered products the diabetes care unit’s sales of pen needles and the pharmaceutical systems unit’s sales of selfinjection systems fiscal year 2016  medical segment revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by the termination of a distribution contract in the respiratory solutions unit

costs relating to acquisitions and other restructurings in 2017  2016  and 2015  primarily represented integration and restructuring costs substantially associated with our fiscal year 2015 acquisition of carefusion and other portfolio rationalization initiatives integration costs in 2017  also included costs relating to our pending acquisition of bard restructuring costs in 2016  included a 214 million charge recorded to impair capitalized internaluse software assets held for sale as a result of information technology function transformation efforts transaction costs were incurred in 2017  in connection with the pending acquisition of bard and other portfolio rationalization initiatives transaction costs were also incurred in 2015  in connection with the carefusion acquisition for further disclosures regarding the costs relating to acquisitions and other restructurings refer to notes 7 9 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

other operating income expense net 

other operating expense in 2017  included the 748 million  noncash charge resulting from the modification to our dispensing equipment lease contracts with customers additional disclosures regarding this lease contract modification are provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data other operating income in 2017  included a 336 million reversal of certain reserves related to an appellate court decision which among other things reversed an unfavorable antitrust judgment in the retractable technologies inc case additional disclosures regarding this legal matter are provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

net interest expense 



the increase in interest expense in 2017  compared with 2016  primarily reflected higher levels of debt due to our issuances of senior unsecured us notes during the third quarter of 2017 as well as bridge financing commitment fees of 79 million the increase in interest expense in 2016  reflected a full year of increased financing costs associated with the carefusion acquisition including interest on senior unsecured notes issued in december 2014 this increase in financing costs was partially offset by the full year impact of favorable amortization of the acquisitiondate fair value stepup on carefusion’s longterm debt as well as by the prioryear impact of commitment fees incurred for a bridge loan facility additional disclosures regarding our financing arrangements and debt instruments are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the increase in interest income in 2017 compared with 2016  primarily reflected higher levels of cash on hand as a result of our third quarter issuances of debt and equity securities as well as higher investment gains on assets related to our deferred compensation plans the increase in interest income in 2016  reflected the realization of investment gains on assets related to our deferred compensation plans compared with the realization of losses in 2015  partially offset by lower cash levels outside of the united states the offsetting movements in the deferred compensation plan liability were recorded in selling and administrative expense  

income taxes 

the income tax rates in 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 



the decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2017 largely reflected the more favorable tax impact from specified items recognized in 2017  compared with 2016  as well as the tax benefits recorded upon the settlement of sharebased compensation awards in 2017  the sharebased compensationrelated tax benefits were recognized in connection with bds adoption of new accounting requirements relating to the income tax effects of sharebased compensation awards additional disclosures regarding this adoption are provided in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the increase in the effective income tax rate from 2015  to 2016  is primarily due to the decrease in tax benefits on specified items as the tax benefits on specified items in 2015  were primarily incurred in higher tax jurisdictions the income tax rates in fiscal years 2016  also reflected the extension of the us research and development income tax credit which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of onetime discrete items 

net income and diluted earnings per share 

net income and diluted earnings per share in 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 



the dilutive impact from share issuances in 2017  represents the impact of bd shares issued in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 in anticipation of the pending bard acquisition the dilutive impact from share issuances in 2015  represents the impact from shares issued as consideration for the carefusion acquisition prior to the inclusion of carefusion in consolidated results of operations 

financial instrument market risk 

we selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations the counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign exchange risk 

bd and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout europe greater asia canada and latin america we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency these payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions we hedge substantially all such exposures primarily through the use of forward contracts we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations including sales to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period from time to time we may 

purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future earnings resulting from adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions we did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2017  or 2016  

derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value for foreign currency derivatives market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities 

with respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2017  and 2016  the impact changes in the us dollar would have on pretax earnings was estimated as follows 



these calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments 

interest rate risk 

our primary interest rate risk relates to us dollar borrowings which are partially offset by us dollar cash investments when managing interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments we may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interestbearing investments in tandem since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure for interest rate derivative instruments fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using marketbased observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities 

with respect to the interest rate derivatives outstanding at september 30 2017  and 2016  a 10 change in interest rates would not materially impact the fair value of these derivatives based on our overall interest rate exposure at september 30 2017  and 2016  a 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our earnings or cash flows over a oneyear period 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows in 2017  2016  and 2015  



net cash flows from operating activities 

the fiscal year 2017  2016  and 2015  changes in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and other noncash items the fiscal year 2017  change in operating assets and liabilities was a net use of cash and primarily reflected higher levels of prepaid expenses trade receivables and inventory partially offset by higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses the fiscal year 2016  change in operating assets and liabilities was a net source of cash and 

primarily reflected higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses as well as lower levels of inventory prepayments and financing receivables partially offset by higher levels of accounts receivables net cash provided by operating activities in 2017  also reflected an adjustment for the noncash charge resulting from the modification to our dispensing equipment lease contracts with customers as previously discussed and the losses recorded upon our extinguishment of certain longterm notes which are included within other net  the previously discussed noncash charge recorded to impair capitalized internaluse software assets held for sale is included within other net  in 2016  net cash provided by operating activities in 2016  was reduced by changes in the pension obligation resulting primarily from a discretionary cash contribution of 100 million 

net cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures 

our investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities and support our strategy of geographic expansion with select investments in growing markets capital expenditures of 727 million  693 million  596 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively primarily related to manufacturing capacity expansions and details of spending by segment are contained in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

investments 

cash inflows from the sales of investments of 840 million  in 2015  were attributable to the maturities of time deposits in europe latin america and asia pacific 

acquisitions of businesses 

cash outflows relating to acquisitions in 2017  included payments for acquisitions which were immaterial both individually and in the aggregate cash outflows relating to acquisitions in 2015  of 8414 billion  were primarily attributable to the completion of the carefusion acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015  for further discussion refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

divestitures of businesses 

cash inflows relating to business divestitures in 2017 were 165 million net cash flows from investing activities in 2016  included 158 million of proceeds from the sales of noncore assets 

net cash flows from financing activities 

net cash from financing activities in 2017  2016  and 2015  included the following significant cash flows 



additional disclosures regarding the equity and debtrelated financing activities detailed above are provided in notes 3 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data no further share repurchases are currently planned as our share repurchase program has been suspended in connection with the announced agreement to acquire bard 

debtrelated activities 

certain measures relating to our total debt were as follows 



 

the decrease in shortterm debt as a percentage of total debt at september 30 2017 was largely driven by our issuance of 9675 billion of senior unsecured us notes during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 the ratio of shortterm debt as a percentage of total debt at september 30 2016 primarily reflected the reclassifications of 800 million of notes from longterm debt to shortterm debt offset by the repayment of 750 million of floating rate notes during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 and a reduction of commercial paper borrowings additional disclosures regarding our debt instruments are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

cash and shortterm investments 

at september 30 2017  total worldwide cash and shortterm investments were 14201 billion  of which 1196 billion  was held in jurisdictions outside of the united states total cash at september 30 2017 included net proceeds raised through public offerings of equity securities and debt transactions which occurred during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 as previously discussed 

we regularly review the amount of cash and shortterm investments held outside the united states and currently intend to use such amounts to fund our international operations and their growth initiatives in addition if these amounts were repatriated from foreign jurisdictions to the united states there could be adverse tax consequences 

credit facilities 

we have in place a 15 billion syndicated credit facility which can be used for general corporate purposes there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility at september 30 2017 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 we extended the expiration date of this credit facility to january 2022 from the original expiration date of january 2021 we may issue up to 100 million in letters of credit under this facility and it also includes a provision that enables bd subject to additional commitments made by the lenders to access up to an additional 500 million in financing through the facility for a maximum aggregate commitment of 2 billion the credit facility includes a single financial covenant that requires bd to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 4to1 for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters we were in compliance with this covenant as of september 30 2017  we also have informal lines of credit outside the united states 

the company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of september 30 2017  

the developments discussed below occurred in 2017  relative to our credit facilities in connection with the announcement of the acquisition of bard 

term loan and revolving credit facilities 

  

in may 2017 we entered into a threeyear 225 billion senior unsecured term loan facility the proceeds from this facility may only be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the bard acquisition as well as the fees and expenses incurred in connection with this acquisition also in may 2017 we entered into a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility that will provide borrowing of up to 225 billion when the facility becomes effective upon the closing of the bard acquisition this facility will expire in may 2022 upon the effective date of the facility it will replace the 15 billion syndicated credit facility discussed further above we will be able to issue up to 100 million in letters of credit under this new revolving credit facility and it also includes a provision that enables bd subject to additional commitments made by the lenders to access up to an additional 500 million in financing through the facility for a maximum aggregate commitment of 275 billion we will use proceeds from this facility to fund general corporate needs and to redeem repurchase or defease certain of bards outstanding senior unsecured notes that will be assumed upon the closing of the acquisition 

the agreements for both the new term loan and revolving credit facility contain the following financial covenants 

 bridge facility 

upon securing permanent financing including the issuances of senior unsecured us notes and equity securities in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 as previously discussed above an agreement for fully committed bridge financing of 157 billion we had secured in concurrence with the announcement of the acquisition agreement was terminated 

access to capital and credit ratings 

our ability to generate cash flow from operations issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms could be adversely affected in the event there was a material decline in the demand for our products deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions 

our corporate credit ratings with the rating agencies standard  poors ratings services sp moodys investor service moodys and fitch ratings fitch were as follows at september 30 2017  



 upon our announcement of the agreement to acquire bard sp placed our corporate credit rating of bbb on creditwatch the bbb rating sp assigned to our new term loan facility and the senior unsecured us notes we issued in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 have also been placed on creditwatch by the ratings agency sp has indicated that this placement will be resolved upon the acquisitions closing which is expected to occur in the fourth calendar quarter of 2017 and that our corporate debt rating by sp will be lowered one notch to bbb sp also assigned a bbb rating to the previously discussed mandatory convertible preferred stock we issued in may 2017 

also upon our announcement of the agreement to acquire bard moodys placed our baa2 and p2 ratings on review for downgrade and these ratings currently remain under review additionally moodys assigned a corporate credit rating of ba1 to our new term loan facility and to all of the tranches of senior unsecured us notes issued in the third quarter except for the tranche of 2133 notes due june 6 2019 which was assigned a corporate credit rating of baa2 moodys assigned a corporate credit rating of baa2 to eurodenominated notes we also issued in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 moodys has placed the ratings assigned to the tranche of 2133 notes and the eurodenominated notes on review for downgrade moodys also assigned a ba1 rating to the bd notes we are offering in exchange of exiting bard notes upon the closing of the bard acquisition we expect moody’s to downgrade our credit rating to below investment grade 

additionally upon our announcement of the bard agreement fitch assigned corporate debt ratings to bd for the first time and assigned bd a longterm issuer default rating of bbb and an outlook of stable fitch also assigned a bbb rating to the eurodenominated notes we issued in the third quarter 

there were no changes to bds longterm debt and commercial paper ratings during 2016 lower corporate debt ratings and further downgrades of our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing we believe that given our debt ratings our financial management policies our ability to generate cash flow and the noncyclical geographically diversified nature of our businesses we would have access to additional shortterm and longterm capital should the need arise a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change 

contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future the table below sets forth bd’s significant contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of september 30 2017  



  

 critical accounting policies 

the following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

some of our sales transactions qualify as multipleelement arrangements which require us to identify separate units of accounting within the arrangement and allocate the transaction consideration across these separate accounting units for arrangements that include software and nonsoftware elements the transaction consideration is allocated to the software elements as a group as well as to the individual nonsoftware elements that have been separately identified the identification of accounting units and the allocation of total transaction consideration for multipleelement arrangements may be subjective and requires a degree of management judgment management’s judgments relative to multipleelement arrangements may affect the timing of revenue recognition 

transaction consideration for separately identified nonsoftware units of accounting within an arrangement is recognized upon the completion of each deliverable based on its relative selling price when applying the relative selling price method the selling price of each deliverable is determined based upon the following hierarchy of evidence vendorspecific objective evidence which is generally based upon historical prices in standalone transactions thirdparty evidence which is generally based on market data on sales of similar products and services if available and management’s best estimate of selling price management’s best estimate of selling price is generally based upon the following considerations standalone sales prices 

established price lists costs to produce profit margins for similar products market conditions and customer stratification 

for software and softwarerelated products we use the relative fair value method to allocate transaction consideration to each unit of accounting whereby the evidence used in the determination of fair value estimates are based solely on vendorspecific objective evidence to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for delivered elements of the transaction we apply the residual method 

the revenue allocated to equipment or instruments in multipleelement arrangements is recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer the revenue allocated to extended warranty contracts and software maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized as these deliverables are performed under the arrangement the majority of deferred revenue relating to extended warranty contracts is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period 

accounting for salestype leases 

our accounting for salestype leases which are primarily associated with dispensing products within our medication management solutions unit is based upon certain assumptions including the economic life of our leased products and the fair value of our leased products which is used to determine the interest rate implicit to the lease these assumptions affect that amount of gross investment in the lease unearned income and the sales price that is recognized relative to each salestype lease transaction the economic life of our leased products is based on the estimated period during which the leased product is expected to be economically usable without limitation by the lease term and includes an estimate of future technological advances 

the fair value of our leased products is estimated on a quarterly basis based upon transacted cash sales prices during the preceding 12month period and represents normal selling price reflecting any volume or trade discounts that may apply because our products are sold as part of customized systems to a diverse range of customers many of which are affiliated with a group purchasing organization or integrated delivery network there is a wide range of negotiated cash selling prices for our products accordingly we stratify our cash selling transactions based on product configuration and customer class to determine an estimate of fair value for each product specific within determined customer classes based upon this stratification we calculate the weighted average selling price of each configured product using the interquartile range methodology and remove outliers from the population of normal cash selling prices which narrows the range of selling prices within each stratified customer class the resulting weighted average selling price is the single point estimate of fair value that we use as the normal selling price and this fair value estimate is used to determine the implicit interest rate for each product subject to a salestype lease arrangement in certain instances we do not have sufficient corresponding historical cash selling transactions to support fair values of specific combinations of product configurations and customer classes in these instances fair value is estimated by applying the average discount percentage given to the respective customer class over the trailing 12 months to the list price of the products whose fair value was not determined using the interquartile range methodology described above the resulting fair values is then used to derive the implicit rate of the lease the interest rate implicit to the lease is then used to determine the amount of revenue recognized at the inception of the lease and the revenue recognized over the life of the lease 

our net investment in salestype leases primarily arises from the leasing of dispensing equipment and as such the methodology for determining the relating allowance for credit losses is based on the collective population and is not stratified by class or portfolio segment the allowance for credit losses is based on historical experience loss rates as well as on management’s judgments regarding the potential impact of anticipated changes in business practices market dynamics and economic conditions these assumptions are inherently subjective and it is possible that we will experience actual credit losses that are different from our current estimates 

in april 2017 in conjunction with the implementation of a new gotomarket business model for our dispensing business we amended new and existing leases to provide a limited return option prior to the amendment these leases were accounted for as salestype leases in accordance with accounting standards 

codification 840 leases as the typical noncancellable lease term of 5 years exceeded 75 of the equipment’s estimated useful life and the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeded 90 of the equipment’s fair value as salestype leases we recognized revenue upon installation of equipment at a customer site based on the present value of the minimum lease payments as a result of the contract amendment the amended lease term is shortened and as a result the majority of leases no longer meet the criteria for recognition as salestype leases accordingly the leases have been classified as operating leases as of the modification date and revenue is generally recognized ratably over the lease term 

accounting for software products 

we sell and lease products with embedded software and as such we must evaluate these products to determine if industryspecific revenue recognition requirements apply to these sales transactions this evaluation process is often complex and subject to significant judgment if software is considered not essential to the nonsoftware elements of a product but is considered more than incidental to a product as a whole the product’s software elements must be separated from its nonsoftware elements under the requirements relating to multipleelement arrangements the product’s software elements must be accounted for under software industryspecific revenue recognition requirements and the application of these requirements may significantly affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized 

while we have determined that the software embedded in the following product groupings is more than incidental to the products as a whole the nonsoftware elements ie hardware and software elements work together to deliver the essential functionality of these products as a whole as such the accounting for these product offerings does not fall within the scope of software industryspecific accounting requirements 

 our standalone software application sales and any related postcontract support related to these sales are accounted for under the software industryspecific revenue recognition requirements 

impairment of assets 

goodwill and inprocess research and development assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with finite lives including developed technology and other longlived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units generally represent one level below reporting segments and we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics potential impairment of goodwill is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value our annual goodwill impairment test performed on july 1 2017  did not result in any impairment charges as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

we generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with bd’s business plans the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and potentially result in different impacts to bd’s results of operations actual results may differ from management’s estimates 

income taxes 

bd maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 

bd conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions our past audit experience with similar situations and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters bd’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if upon resolution with taxing authorities we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

bd has reviewed its needs in the us for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and with exception for certain countries continues to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the us to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property plant and equipment expenditure needs deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested at september 30 2017  the cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the united states was 96 billion  the determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation 

contingencies 

we are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including without limitation product liability antitrust and environmental matters as further discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses we establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries a determination of the amount of accruals if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue and when appropriate is developed after consultation with outside counsel the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows 

benefit plans 

we have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations these benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate pension benefit costs also include an assumption for the expected return on plan assets these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

the discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date september 30 specifically for the us pension plan we will use a discount rate of 373 for 2018  which was based on an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve to measure liabilities as 

of the measurement date to calculate the pension expense in 2018  we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2018  are provided in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption although reviewed each year changes less frequently due to the longterm nature of the assumption this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date rather it is used only in the calculation of pension expense to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider many factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results benchmark data expected returns on various plan asset classes as well as current and expected asset allocations we will use a longterm expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 725 for the us pension plan in 2018  we believe our discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our us pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows 

 sharebased compensation 

compensation cost relating to sharebased payment transactions is recognized in net income using a fair value measurement method all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options are recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense based on their fair values over the vesting period of the awards we determine the fair value of certain sharebased awards using a latticebased binomial option valuation model that incorporates certain assumptions such as the riskfree interest rate expected volatility expected dividend yield and expected life of the options see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

bd and its representatives may from time to time make certain forwardlooking statements in publicly released materials both written and oral including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission press releases and our reports to shareholders forwardlooking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan” “expect” “believe” “intend” “will” “may” “anticipate” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with among other things discussions of future operations and financial performance including volume growth sales and earnings per share growth and cash flows and statements regarding our strategy for growth future product development regulatory approvals competitive position and expenditures all statements that address our future operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forwardlooking statements 

forwardlooking statements are and will be based on management’s thencurrent views and assumptions regarding future events developments and operating performance and speak only as of their dates investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements furthermore we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information 

future events and developments or otherwise except as required by applicable law or regulations 

the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements for further discussion of certain of these factors see item 1a risk factors 



regulatory process may also delay product launches and increase development costs 



combine and integrate the carefusion operations in order to fully obtain the anticipated benefits and costs savings from the transaction 

 the foregoing list sets forth many but not all of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forwardlooking statements investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties

foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues bd believes its activities in some countries outside the united states involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein as well as the economic environment local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties see further discussion of this risk in item 1a risk factors 

distribution 

bd’s products are marketed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to endusers by bd and independent sales representatives order backlog is not material to bd’s business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock bd’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the medication and procedural solutions business unit and respiratory and flu diagnostic products in the diagnostic systems business unit which relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza 

raw materials 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products bd seeks to ensure continuity of raw material supply by securing multiple options for sourcing however there are situations where raw materials are only available from one supplier which are referred to as sole sourced the use of sole sourced materials may be due to sourcing of proprietary andor patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product in other cases while a raw material can be sourced from multiple manufacturers only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance cost or other considerations in order to provide alternate sources of raw materials bd must complete a rigorous qualification process which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval if clinical trials are not required this qualification process can take 318 months depending on the criticality of the change when clinical trials are required this process may lengthen the qualification phase from one to three years bd continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and maintains business continuity plans with our suppliers bd’s continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities maintaining contingency stock internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts while bd works closely with its suppliers there may nonetheless be events that cause supply interruption reduction or termination that adversely impacts bd’s ability to manufacture and sell certain products 

research and development 

bd conducts its research and development “rd” activities at its operating units and at bd technologies in research triangle park north carolina the majority of bd’s rd activities are conducted in north america outside north america bd conducts rd activities in china france india ireland and singapore bd also collaborates with certain universities medical centers and other entities on rd programs and retains individual consultants and partners to support its efforts in specialized fields bd spent approximately 828 million 632 million and 550 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended september 30 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

intellectual property and licenses 

bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bd’s business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bd’s business as a whole or to any business segment 

competition 

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment in addition the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations are creating increased pricing pressures particularly in developing markets some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs 

bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement in support of its core strategy  to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers 

thirdparty reimbursement 

a majority of bd’s customers rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures products and services they provide our technologies are subject to worldwide regulations regarding reimbursement developed by government agencies including the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms in the united states the national health service in the united kingdom the joint federal committee in germany the commission d’evaluation des produits et prestations in france the ministry for health labor and 

welfare in japan the ministry of health and the national development and reform commission in china among many others in addition our technologies are also subject to reimbursement policies issued by private insurance companies and managed care organizations 

bd is actively engaged in identifying and communicating value propositions of its products for payer provider and patient stakeholders and it employs various efforts and resources to positively impact coverage coding and payment pathways however bd has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and payment levels for bd products the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer’s discretion as bd’s product offerings are diverse across a variety of healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment pathways that impact the decisions of healthcare providers regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products therefore changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products in any given country for any given product 

as government programs seek to expand healthcare coverage for their citizens they have at the same time sought to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures products or services many thirdparty payers have developed specific payment and delivery mechanisms to support these cost control efforts and to focus on paying for value these mechanisms include payment reductions pay for performance measures qualitybased performance payments restrictive coverage policies bidding and tender mechanics studies to compare the effectiveness of therapies and use of technology assessments these changes have created an increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective and qualitydriven healthcare 

in addition as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” the us is now moving beyond value based payment methodologies and seeking to create alternative payment models such as bundled payments to continue to drive improved value we see other governments around the world considering similar bundling reform measures including the development of the diagnosis related group “drg” as a payment mechanism to drive toward quality and resource based reimbursement 

see item 1a risk factors for a further discussion 

regulation 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

bd actively maintains fdaiso quality systems that establish standards for its product design manufacturing and distribution processes prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of bd’s quality systems as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials these regulatory controls as well as any changes in fda policies can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

bd also is subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the united states concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws global anticorruption transportation safety and health and customs and exports many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years this appears to be part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the united states 

in addition as part of ppaca the federal government has enacted the sunshine act provisions requiring bd to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals many of these provisions are new and uncertain and failure to comply could result in a range of fines penalties andor other sanctions 

our infusion pump business unit is operating under an amended consent decree entered into by carefusion with the fda in 2007 carefusion’s consent decree with the fda related to its alaris se infusion pumps in february 2009 carefusion and the fda amended the consent decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for carefusion 303 inc the business unit that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the united states the amended consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories 

while this bd business unit remains subject to the amended consent decree which includes the requirements of the original consent decree it has made substantial progress in its compliance efforts however we cannot predict the outcome of this matter and the amended consent decree authorizes the fda in the event of any violations in the future to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing infusion pumps recall products and take other actions we may be required to pay damages of 15000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree up to 15 million per year 

we also cannot currently predict whether additional monetary investment will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matter’s ultimate impact on our business we may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because among other things the fda may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree andor we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree as of september 30 2016 we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the amended consent decree and accordingly we have no accruals associated with compliance with the amended consent decree 

see also item 3 legal proceedings

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows 

risks relating to the company 

global economic conditions could adversely affect our operations 

deterioration in the global economic environment particularly in emerging markets and countries with governmentsponsored healthcare systems may cause decreased demand for our products and services and increased competition which could result in lower sales volume and downward pressure on the prices for our products longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply we have also previously experienced delays in collecting government receivables in certain countries in western europe due to economic conditions and we may experience similar delays in the future in these and other countries or regions experiencing financial problems 

the medical technology industry is very competitive 

we are a global company that faces significant competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies with multiple product lines some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines we face competition across all our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features clinical outcomes product quality price services and other factors in addition we face changing customer preferences and requirements including increased customer demand for more environmentallyfriendly products 

the medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change and discovery the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations has also created pricing pressure particularly in developing markets 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

a substantial amount of our revenues are derived from international operations and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the us in the future the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 7 management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks 

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources and by country may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states or abroad changes in reimbursement rates by private payers or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business 

federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

the ppaca imposes on medical device manufacturers such as bd a 23 excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices while the excise tax has been suspended until the end of 2017 it may be reinstated in 2018 or beyond in addition the ppaca among other things reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures these factors in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursement rates for our products other provisions in the law may significantly change the practice of health care and could adversely affect aspects of our business 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation resulting in companies with greater market presence health care systems and other health care companies are also consolidating resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies as a result competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

cost volatility could adversely affect our operations 

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials components freight and energy that increases the costs of producing and distributing our products new laws or regulations adopted in response to 

climate change could also increase energy costs as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components in particular we purchase supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products and any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results increases in oil prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs we may not be able to offset any increases in these operational costs 

breaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations including sensitive personal information and proprietary or confidential information in addition some of our products include information technology that collects data regarding patients and patient therapy on behalf of our customers and some connect to our systems for maintenance purposes our information technology systems have been subjected to attack via malicious code execution cyber or phishing attacks and we have experienced instances of unauthorized access to our systems in the past and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future in addition to our own information in the course of doing business we sometimes store information with third parties that could be subject to these types of attacks cyberattacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being accessed or stolen likewise we could suffer disruption of our operations and other significant negative consequences including increased costs for security measures or remediation diversion of management attention and adverse impact on our relationships with vendors business partners and customers unauthorized tampering adulteration or interference with our products may also create issues with product functionality that could result in a loss of data risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions our lack of success in preventing unauthorized access to our systems and products could also result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation while we will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect the company against unauthorized access to our systems and work with government authorities to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated frequent and adaptive there can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on product offerings that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers the development of these products requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products and technologies successfully complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 

we cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

we may seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky and the integration of any newlyacquired business requires significant effort and management attention the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 

the international operations of our business may subject us to certain business risks 

a substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the united states and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets especially in emerging markets our foreign operations subject us to certain risks including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above the effects of local economic and political conditions foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements local product preferences and product requirements difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations differing labor regulations changes in tax laws potential political instability weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries import or export licensing requirements trade protection measures and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders the success of our operations outside the united states depends in part on our ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and sales and distribution networks 

the june 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union “eu” commonly known as “brexit” has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the united kingdom “uk” and the eu following the vote there was a significant decline in the value of the british pound compared to the us dollar and there may be continued volatility in exchange rates and economic conditions as the uk negotiates its exit from the eu until the terms and timing of the uk’s exit 

from the eu are determined it is difficult to predict its impact it is possible that the referendum and proposed withdrawal could among other things affect the legal and regulatory schemes to which our businesses are subject impact trade between the uk and the eu and other parties and create economic uncertainty in the region 

in addition our international operations are governed by the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws outside the us global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more enforcement proceedings by us and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties while we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws our international operations which often involve customer relationships with foreign governments create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees consultants sales agents or distributors any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities and negatively affect our reputation 

under the us tax code we may also be subject to additional taxation to the extent we repatriate earnings from our foreign operations to the us in the event we require more capital in the united states than is generated by our us operations to fund acquisitions or other activities and elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rate may be higher as a result 

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our business 

we sell products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and agencies in other countries the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable for instance there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods the availability of governmental research funding may be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

we purchase many different types of raw materials and components used in our products certain raw materials and components are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons we elect to purchase certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers the supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of reasons including economic conditions as described above while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants damage to one or more of these facilities from weather or natural disasters or issues in our manufacturing process equipment failure or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture these products resulting in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers 

we are subject to lawsuits 

we are or have been a defendant in a number of lawsuits including purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and suits alleging patent infringement and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to extensive regulation 

our operations are global and are affected by complex state federal and international laws relating to healthcare environmental protection antitrust anticorruption fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws export control employment and other areas violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions including substantial 

fines and in some cases exclusion from participation in health care programs such as medicare and medicaid environmental laws particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases are also becoming more stringent throughout the world which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers or result in liability to bd if we violate such laws the enactment of additional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations 

we are also subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of our products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources and these have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda for supporting data for submissions the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable fda and other regulatory requirements continue to be met following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production marketing or sale of our products and result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances closure of manufacturing sites seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation more stringent oversight by the fda and other agencies in recent years has resulted in increased enforcement activity which increases the compliance risk for us and other companies in our industry 

as a result of the carefusion acquisition we are operating under a consent decree with the fda that was entered into by carefusion in 2009 that affects our infusion pump business in the united states for more information regarding the consent decree see “regulation” under item 1 “business” 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unapproved use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs and lost sales as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products 

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 

many of our businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property assets these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position in addition competitors may seek to invalidate patents on our products or claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property which could result in a loss of competitive advantage or the payment of significant legal fees damage awards and past or future royalties as well as injunctions against future sales of our products we also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the us which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

natural disasters war and other events could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

natural disasters including pandemics war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts and actions taken by the united states and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and areas outside of the united states in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers 

we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 

our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for 

persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected 

risks relating to our acquisition of carefusion 

the integration process with carefusion may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized 

the success of our acquisition of carefusion including anticipated benefits and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our business with the business of carefusion it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees higher than expected costs diversion of management attention and resources the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger as part of the integration process we intend to move assets within our combined company to create efficiencies and may seek to opportunistically divest certain assets of the combined company which may change the profile of the combined company and which may not be possible on favorable terms or at all if we experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected these integration matters could have an adverse effect on the combined company for an undetermined period going forward in addition the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated 

in connection with the carefusion transactions we incurred and assumed significant additional indebtedness which could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility 

we have substantially increased indebtedness following completion of the carefusion acquisition in comparison to that of bd on a recent historical basis which has increased our interest expense and could have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness following the merger and thus the demands on our cash resources is greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the acquisition our increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions funding research and development or future expansion of our business and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for bd relative to other companies with lower debt levels if we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the transaction or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations then our ability to service this indebtedness may be adversely impacted 

certain of the indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition bears interest at variable interest rates if interest rates increase variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements which could adversely affect our cash flows 

in addition our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations our ratings were downgraded in connection with the indebtedness incurred and assumed in the acquisition of carefusion and there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future moreover we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate requirements our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that may affect our ability to operate our businesses 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with the carefusion transaction contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries including carefusion to among other things have liens on their property transact business with affiliates andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person in addition some of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenants that will require us to maintain certain financial ratios our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate our repayment obligations

acquisition of carefusion 

on march 17 2015 bd acquired a 100 interest in carefusion corporation carefusion carefusion’s operating results were included in bd’s consolidated results of operations beginning on april 1 2015 and as such the consolidated results of operations for the first six months of fiscal year 2015 referenced in the commentary provided further below did not include carefusions results carefusion operates as part of our medical segment 

summary of financial results 

worldwide revenues in 2016  of 12483 billion  increased 214 from the prior year compared with an increase of 217 in 2015  revenue growth in 2016  largely reflected the impact from the inclusion of carefusion’s sales in the companys results for a full fiscal year in 2016  as compared with only half the fiscal year in 2015  as discussed above revenues in 2016  also reflected volume growth of approximately 42 which included an unfavorable impact from the termination of a distribution agreement in the respiratory solutions unit revenue growth in 2016  additionally reflected an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of approximately 31 and a relatively immaterial favorable impact from price revenue growth in 2015  reflected a 241 impact from the inclusion of carefusions sales in the companys results from april 1 2015 as discussed above as well as volume growth of 51 and unfavorable foreign currency translation of 75 

volume growth in 2016  reflected the following 

 we continue to invest in research and development geographic expansion and new product promotions to drive further revenue and profit growth our ability to sustain our longterm growth will depend on a number of factors including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion develop innovative new products and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness while the economic environment for the healthcare industry has stabilized pricing pressures continue for some of our products healthcare utilization has stabilized and slightly improved in the united states however any destabilization in the future could adversely impact our us businesses additionally macroeconomic challenges in europe continue to constrain healthcare utilization although we currently view the environment as stable in emerging markets the company’s growth is dependent primarily on government funding for healthcare systems 

our financial position remains strong with cash flows from operating activities totaling 2559 billion  in 2016  at september 30 2016  we had 16 billion  in cash and equivalents and shortterm investments we continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends during fiscal year 2016  we paid cash dividends of 562 million  no shares were repurchased during fiscal year 2016  

each reporting period we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period the ongoing relative strength of the us dollar resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenue growth during the fiscal year we evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currencyneutral basis which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currencyneutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods foreign currencyneutral fxn information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a foreign currencyneutral basis as one measure to evaluate our performance we calculate foreign currencyneutral percentages by converting our currentperiod local currency financial results using the priorperiod foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our currentperiod results these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap results on a foreign currencyneutral basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap

safetyengineered products the diabetes care unit’s sales of pen needles as well as international sales of safetyengineered products and favorable timing of ordering patterns in the pharmaceutical systems unit 

medical segment operating income was as follows 



the medical segments operating income is driven by its performance with respect to gross profit margin and operating expenses the medical segments gross profit margin in 2016  was slightly higher as compared with 2015 primarily due to lower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous operations improvement projects which improved the efficiency of our operations partially offset by the recognition of a full year of amortization relating to intangible assets acquired in the carefusion transaction and by unfavorable foreign currency translation the medical segments gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues was lower in 2015  as compared with 2014  primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the carefusion transaction and the amortization of the acquisitiondate writedown of carefusion’s deferred revenue balance as previously discussed these unfavorable impacts on gross margin in 2015  were partially offset primarily by lower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous improvement projects selling and administrative expense in 2016  as a percentage of medical revenues primarily reflected the suspension of the medical device excise tax imposed under the us patient protection affordable care act selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2015  primarily reflected the inclusion of carefusion’s spending as well as depreciation of fixed assets acquired in the carefusion acquisition in the second half of 2015  results research and development expenses in 2016  increased 172 million or 63 from 2015  which reflected the inclusion of carefusion spending for a full fiscal year as well as increased investment in new products and platforms research and development expenses in 2015  increased 85 million or 46 from 2014  primarily due to the inclusion of carefusions costs in the second half of 2015  results

specified items 

reflected in the financial results for 2016  2015  and 2014  were the following specified items 



  



gross profit margin 

the comparison of gross profit margins in 2016  and 2015  and the comparison of gross profit margins in 2015  and 2014  reflected the following impacts 



gross profit margin in 2016  benefited from a favorable comparison to 2015  which reflected the fair value stepup adjustment recorded relative to carefusion’s inventory on the acquisition date as previously discussed partially offset by the recognition in 2016  of a full year of amortization relating to carefusions intangible assets the operating performance impacts in 2016  and 2015  primarily reflected lower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous operations improvement projects which improved the efficiency of our operations 

operating expenses 

operating expenses in 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 



selling and administrative 

selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2016  reflected synergies resulting from the carefusion acquisition as well as favorable foreign currency translation and a suspension of the medical device excise tax as previously discussed selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2016  was unfavorably impacted by higher selling expenses relating to product launches and higher shipping expenses selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2015  reflected favorable foreign currency translation partially offset by the impacts of increased spending relating to the expansion of our business in emerging markets a charge relating to the rti litigation matter as previously discussed as well as depreciation of fixed assets acquired in the carefusion acquisition 

research and development 

research and development expense in 2016  reflected the inclusion of carefusion’s research and development expenses in the companys results for the full fiscal year 2016  and increased investment in high growth opportunities research and development expense in 2015  reflected the inclusion of carefusion’s research and development expenses in the results for the second half of fiscal year 2015  research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2015  was lower in comparison to 2014  which included a workforce reduction charge asset writeoffs and program termination charges as well as ongoing investment in new products and platforms within the medical segment 

acquisitions and other restructurings 

costs relating to acquisitions and other restructurings represented transaction integration and restructuring costs substantially associated with the carefusion acquisition and portfolio rationalization the transaction and integration costs specifically included advisory legal and other costs substantially incurred in connection with the carefusion acquisition restructuring costs in 2016 included a 214 million charge recorded to impair capitalized internaluse software assets held for sale as a result of the information technology function transformation efforts for further disclosures regarding the costs relating 

to acquisitions and other restructurings refer to notes 1 7 8 9 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

net interest expense 



the increase in interest expense in 2016  reflected a full year of increased financing costs associated with the carefusion acquisition including interest on 62 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in december 2014 in anticipation of closing the carefusion acquisition this increase in financing costs was partially offset by the full year impact of favorable amortization of the acquisitiondate fair value stepup on carefusion’s longterm debt as well as by the prioryear impact of commitment fees incurred for a bridge loan facility that was terminated in march 2015 the increase in interest expense in 2015  compared with 2014  primarily reflected interest associated with the 62 billion of senior unsecured notes and the commitment fees for the bridge loan facility as discussed above these increases in interest expense in fiscal year 2015  were partially offset by favorable amortization of the fair value stepup recorded on carefusion’s longterm debt beginning on april 1 2015 additional disclosures regarding these financing arrangements and our debt instruments are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the increase in interest income in 2016  reflected the realization of investment gains on assets related to our deferred compensation plans compared with the realization of losses in 2015  partially offset by lower cash levels outside of the united states the offsetting movements in the deferred compensation plan liability were recorded in selling and administrative expense  the decrease in interest income in 2015  compared with 2014  reflected lower cash levels outside of the united states as well as investment losses on assets related to our deferred compensation plan 

income taxes 

the income tax rates in 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 



the increase in the effective income tax rate from 2015  to 2016  is primarily due to the decrease in tax benefits on specified items the tax benefits of the specified items shown earlier reduced the income tax rates in 2016  and 2015  by 1090 and 1720 basis points respectively as the tax benefits on these specified items were primarily incurred in higher tax jurisdictions the income tax rates in fiscal years 2016  and 2015  also reflected the extension of the us research and development income tax credit which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of onetime discrete items the effective income tax rate in 2014  reflected our decision to change our position of permanent reinvestment with respect to the unremitted earnings of brazil and certain other latin american jurisdictions the impact of which was more than offset by the benefits resulting from discrete onetime items and geographic mix 

net income and diluted earnings per share 

net income and diluted earnings per share in 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 



financial instrument market risk 

we selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations the counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign exchange risk 

bd and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout europe greater asia canada and latin america we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency these payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions we hedge substantially all such exposures primarily through the use of forward contracts we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations including sales to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period from time to time we may purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future earnings resulting from adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions we did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2016  or 2015  

derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value for foreign currency derivatives market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities 

with respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2016  and 2015  the impact changes in the us dollar would have on pretax earnings was estimated as follows 



these calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments 

interest rate risk 

our primary interest rate risk relates to us dollar borrowings which are partially offset by us dollar cash investments when managing interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments we may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interestbearing investments in tandem since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure for interest rate derivative instruments fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using marketbased observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities 

with respect to the interest rate derivatives outstanding at september 30 2016  and 2015  the impact changes in the interest rate would have on the fair value of these derivatives was estimated as follows 



based on our overall interest rate exposure at september 30 2016  and 2015  a 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our earnings or cash flows over a oneyear period 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows in 2016  2015  and 2014  



net cash flows from operating activities 

the fiscal year 2016  2015  and 2014  changes in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and other noncash items the fiscal year 2016  change in operating assets and liabilities was a net source of cash and primarily reflected higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses as well as lower levels of inventory prepayments and financing receivables partially offset by higher levels of accounts receivables the fiscal year 2015  change in operating assets and liabilities was a net source of cash and primarily reflected lower levels of inventory and higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by higher levels of prepayments the lower levels of inventory reflected the impact primarily recognized in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015  of the acquisition fair value stepup adjustment recorded relative to carefusion’s inventory on the acquisition date net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was reduced by changes in the pension obligation resulting primarily from a discretionary cash contribution of 100 million net cash provided by operating activities in 2015  increased by changes in the pension obligation as currentyear expense was partially offset by discretionary contributions of 40 million the previously discussed noncash charge recorded to impair capitalized internaluse software assets held for sale is included as other operating activities

at september 30 2016  total worldwide cash and shortterm investments were 1568 billion  of which 966 million  was held in jurisdictions outside of the united states we regularly review the amount of cash and shortterm investments held outside the united states and currently intend to use such amounts to fund our international operations and their growth initiatives in addition if these amounts were repatriated from foreign jurisdictions to the united states there could be adverse tax consequences 

credit facilities 

we have in place a commercial paper borrowing program which is available to meet our shortterm financing needs including working capital requirements in february 2016 we increased the size of this program by 500 million so that it allows us to issue a maximum of 15 billion in notes borrowings outstanding under this program were 200 million  at september 30 2016  which reflected a net reduction of 500 million from our outstanding balance of commercial paper borrowings at september 30 2015  as previously discussed 

in january 2016 we replaced an existing 1 billion syndicated credit facility with a 15 billion syndicated credit facility that has an expiration date of january 2021 there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility at september 30 2016  the credit facility under which we may issue up to 100 million in letters of credit provides backup support for our commercial paper program and can also be used for other general corporate purposes it includes a provision that enables bd subject to additional commitments made by the lenders to access up to an additional 500 million in financing through the facility for a maximum aggregate commitment of 2 billion the credit facility includes a single financial covenant that requires bd to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 5to1 for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters we were in compliance with this covenant as of september 30 2016  we also have informal lines of credit outside the united states 

in november 2016 we announced that we commenced tender offers for certain of our senior unsecured notes we expect to finance the tender offer through an issuance of senior notes cash on hand and other sources of liquidity 

access to capital and credit ratings 

our ability to generate cash flow from operations issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms could be adversely affected in the event there was a material decline in the demand for our products deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions 

bd’s credit ratings at september 30 2016  were as follows 



subsequent to bd’s completion of the carefusion acquisition in 2015 standard  poor’s ratings services one of the major corporate debt rating organizations downgraded bd’s longterm debt and commercial paper ratings from a to bbb and from a1 to a2 respectively another major corporate debt rating organization moody’s investors service downgraded bd’s longterm debt rating from a3 to baa2 there were no changes to bds longterm debt and commercial paper ratings with either rating organization during 2016 

bd’s credit ratings remained investment grade after these downgrades and while such downgrades in our credit ratings may increase the costs associated with maintaining and borrowing under our existing credit arrangements the downgrades do not affect our ability to draw on these credit facilities nor do they result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any outstanding debt we believe that given our debt ratings our financial management policies our ability to generate cash flow and the noncyclical geographically diversified nature of our businesses we would have access to additional shortterm and longterm capital should the need arise a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change 

contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future the table below sets forth bd’s significant contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of september 30 2016  



  

 critical accounting policies 

the following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our 

consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

some of our sales transactions qualify as multipleelement arrangements which require us to identify separate units of accounting within the arrangement and allocate the transaction consideration across these separate accounting units for arrangements that include software and nonsoftware elements the transaction consideration is allocated to the software elements as a group as well as to the individual nonsoftware elements that have been separately identified the identification of accounting units and the allocation of total transaction consideration for multipleelement arrangements may be subjective and requires a degree of management judgment management’s judgments relative to multipleelement arrangements may affect the timing of revenue recognition 

transaction consideration for separately identified nonsoftware units of accounting within an arrangement is recognized upon the completion of each deliverable based on its relative selling price when applying the relative selling price method the selling price of each deliverable is determined based upon the following hierarchy of evidence vendorspecific objective evidence which is generally based upon historical prices in standalone transactions thirdparty evidence which is generally based on market data on sales of similar products and services if available and management’s best estimate of selling price management’s best estimate of selling price is generally based upon the following considerations standalone sales prices established price lists costs to produce profit margins for similar products market conditions and customer stratification 

for software and softwarerelated products we use the relative fair value method to allocate transaction consideration to each unit of accounting whereby the evidence used in the determination of fair value estimates are based solely on vendorspecific objective evidence to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for delivered elements of the transaction we apply the residual method 

the revenue allocated to equipment or instruments in multipleelement arrangements is recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer the revenue allocated to extended warranty contracts and software maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized as these deliverables are performed under the arrangement the majority of deferred revenue relating to extended warranty contracts is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period 

accounting for salestype leases 

our accounting for salestype leases is based upon certain assumptions including the economic life of our leased products and the fair value of our leased products which is used to determine the interest rate implicit to the lease these assumptions affect that amount of gross investment in the lease unearned income and the sales price that is recognized relative to each salestype lease transaction based upon our anticipation of future technological advances of our products or that of our competitors the economic life of our leased products is five years as this is the estimated period during which the leased product is expected to be economically usable without limitation by the lease term additionally five years represents the most frequent contractual lease term for our leased products our product configurations are customized for each customer’s specifications and as such there is no significant aftermarket for our used equipment residual values if any are established at lease inception using estimates of the fair value of reclaimable component parts of the products at the end of the lease term 

the fair value of our leased products is estimated on a quarterly basis based upon transacted cash sales prices during the preceding 12month period and represents normal selling price reflecting any volume or trade discounts that may apply because our products are sold as part of customized systems to a diverse range of customers many of which are affiliated with a group purchasing organization or integrated delivery network there is a wide range of negotiated cash selling prices for our products accordingly we stratify our cash selling transactions based on product configuration and customer class to determine a best estimate of fair value for each product specific within determined customer classes based upon this stratification we calculate the weighted average selling price of each configured product using the interquartile range methodology and remove outliers from the population of normal cash selling prices which narrows the range of selling prices within each stratified customer class the resulting weighted average selling price is the single point estimate of fair value that we use as the normal selling price and this fair value estimate is used to determine the implicit interest rate for each product subject to a salestype lease arrangement in certain instances we do not have sufficient corresponding historical cash selling transactions to support fair values of specific combinations of product configurations and customer classes in these instances fair value is estimated by applying the average discount percentage given to the respective customer class over the trailing 12 months to the list price of the products whose fair value was not determined using the interquartile range methodology described above the resulting fair values is then used to derive the implicit rate of the lease the interest rate implicit to the lease is then used to determine the amount of revenue recognized at the inception of the lease and the revenue recognized over the life of the lease 

our net investment in salestype leases primarily arises from the leasing of dispensing equipment and as such the methodology for determining the relating allowance for credit losses is based on the collective population and is not stratified 

by class or portfolio segment the allowance for credit losses is based on historical experience loss rates as well as on management’s judgments regarding the potential impact of anticipated changes in business practices market dynamics and economic conditions these assumptions are inherently subjective and it is possible that we will experience actual credit losses that are different from our current estimates 

accounting for software products 

we sell and lease products with embedded software and as such we must evaluate these products to determine if industryspecific revenue recognition requirements apply to these sales transactions this evaluation process is often complex and subject to significant judgment if software is considered not essential to the nonsoftware elements of a product but is considered more than incidental to a product as a whole the product’s software elements must be separated from its nonsoftware elements under the requirements relating to multipleelement arrangements the product’s software elements must be accounted for under software industryspecific revenue recognition requirements and the application of these requirements may significantly affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized 

while we have determined that the software embedded in the following product groupings is more than incidental to the products as a whole the nonsoftware elements ie hardware and software elements work together to deliver the essential functionality of these products as a whole as such the accounting for these product offerings does not fall within the scope of software industryspecific accounting requirements 

 our standalone software application sales and any related postcontract support related to these sales are accounted for under the software industryspecific revenue recognition requirements 

impairment of assets 

goodwill and inprocess research and development assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with finite lives including developed technology and other longlived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units generally represent one level below reporting segments and we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics potential impairment of goodwill is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value our annual goodwill impairment test performed on july 1 2016  did not result in any impairment charges as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

we generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with bd’s business plans the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and potentially result in different impacts to bd’s results of operations actual results may differ from management’s estimates 

income taxes 

bd maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 

bd conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions our past audit experience with similar situations and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters bd’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if upon resolution with taxing authorities we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

bd has reviewed its needs in the us for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and with exception for certain countries continues to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the us to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property plant and equipment expenditure needs deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested at september 30 2016  the cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the united states was 87 billion the determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation 

contingencies 

we are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including without limitation product liability antitrust and environmental matters as further discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses we establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries a determination of the amount of accruals if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue and when appropriate is developed after consultation with outside counsel the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows 

benefit plans 

we have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations these benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate pension benefit costs also include an assumption for the expected return on plan assets these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

the discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date september 30 specifically for the us pension plan we will use a discount rate of 343 for 2017  which was based on an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date to calculate the pension expense in 2017  we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2017  are provided in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption although reviewed each year changes less frequently due to the longterm nature of the assumption this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date rather it is used only in the calculation of pension expense to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider many factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results benchmark data expected returns on various plan asset classes as well as current and expected asset allocations we will use a longterm expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 725 for the us pension plan in 2017  we believe our discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our us pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows 

 sharebased compensation 

compensation cost relating to sharebased payment transactions is recognized in net income using a fair value measurement method all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options are recognized in 

the statement of operations as compensation expense based on their fair values over the vesting period of the awards we determine the fair value of certain sharebased awards using a latticebased binomial option valuation model that incorporates certain assumptions such as the riskfree interest rate expected volatility expected dividend yield and expected life of the options see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

bd and its representatives may from time to time make certain forwardlooking statements in publicly released materials both written and oral including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission press releases and our reports to shareholders forwardlooking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan” “expect” “believe” “intend” “will” “may” “anticipate” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with among other things discussions of future operations and financial performance including volume growth sales and earnings per share growth and cash flows and statements regarding our strategy for growth future product development regulatory approvals competitive position and expenditures all statements that address our future operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forwardlooking statements 

forwardlooking statements are and will be based on management’s thencurrent views and assumptions regarding future events developments and operating performance and speak only as of their dates investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements furthermore we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information future events and developments or otherwise except as required by applicable law or regulations 

the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements for further discussion of certain of these factors see item 1a risk factors 



business result in the loss of bd trade secrets or otherwise compromise sensitive information of bd or its customers suppliers and other business partners or of customers patients or result in product efficacy or safety concerns for certain of our products

foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues bd believes its activities in some countries outside the united states involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein as well as the economic environment local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties see further discussion of this risk in item 1a risk factors 

distribution 

bd’s products are marketed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to endusers by bd and independent sales representatives order backlog is not material to bd’s business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock bd’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the medication and procedural 

solutions and respiratory solutions business units and respiratory and flu diagnostic products in the diagnostic systems business unit which relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza 

raw materials 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products bd seeks to ensure continuity of raw material supply by securing multiple options for sourcing however there are situations where raw materials are only available from one supplier which are referred to as sole sourced the use of sole sourced materials may be due to sourcing of proprietary andor patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product in other cases while a raw material can be sourced from multiple manufacturers only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance cost or other considerations in order to provide alternate sources of raw materials bd must complete a rigorous qualification process which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval if clinical trials are not required this qualification process can take 318 months depending on the criticality of the change when clinical trials are required this process may lengthen the qualification phase from one to three years bd continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and maintains business continuity plans with our suppliers bd’s continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities maintaining contingency stock internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts while bd works closely with its suppliers there may nonetheless be events that cause supply interruption reduction or termination that adversely impacts bd’s ability to manufacture and sell certain products 

research and development 

bd conducts its research and development “rd” activities at its operating units and at bd technologies in research triangle park north carolina the majority of bd’s rd activities are conducted in north america outside north america bd conducts rd activities in china france india ireland and singapore bd also collaborates with certain universities medical centers and other entities on rd programs and retains individual consultants to support its efforts in specialized fields bd spent approximately 632 million 550 million and 494 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended september 30 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively postacquisition rd spend from legacy carefusion businesses was 115 million in fiscal year 2015 

intellectual property and licenses 

bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bd’s business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bd’s business as a whole or to any business segment 

competition 

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment in addition the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations are creating increased pricing pressures particularly in developing markets some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs 

bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement in support of its core strategy  to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers 

thirdparty reimbursement 

most of our customers and healthcare providers typically rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures products and services they provide our devices are subject to worldwide regulations regarding reimbursement developed by government agencies including the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms in the united states the national health service in the united kingdom the joint federal committee in germany the commission d’evaluation des produits et prestations in france the ministry for health labor and welfare in japan the ministry of health and the national development and reform commission in china among many others in addition our devices are also subject to reimbursement policies issued by private insurance companies and managed care organizations the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer’s discretion the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of these thirdparty payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products thus changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products 

while bd is actively engaged in promoting the value propositions of its products for payer provider and patient stakeholders and it employs various efforts and resources to positively impact coverage coding and payment processes in this regard it has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and payment levels for bd products many thirdparty payers are seeking to control the growth of healthcare expenditures and have developed specific payment and delivery mechanisms to support these cost control efforts these mechanisms include payment reductions pay for performance measures qualitybased performance payments restrictive coverage policies bidding and tender mechanics studies to compare the effectiveness of therapies and use of technology assessments these changes have created an increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective and qualitydriven healthcare as government programs including cms and many other national healthcare programs seek to expand healthcare coverage for their citizens they have at the same time sought to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures products or services 

as bd’s product offerings are diverse across many healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment systems therefore individual countries product lines or product classes may be impacted by changes to these systems governments and payers around the world are altering healthcare delivery and payment pathways to focus on paying for value traditional procurement processes are evolving to drive “value for money” with specific priorities focused on reducing costs and creating efficiencies in the healthcare systems 

the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” has created substantive changes to us healthcare payment systems with respect to medicare the law initially focused on medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs through a variety of value based payment methodologies medicare is now moving beyond payment penalties and seeking to create alternative payment models such as bundled payments to continue to drive improved value the department of health and human services “hhs” announced earlier this year an initiative designed to actively move the medicare program toward paying providers based on the quality rather than the quantity of care they give patients this initiative continues the shift toward reimbursing providers via bundled payments based upon quality and outcomes as a result hhs predicts that by 2018 90 of all feeforservice medicare payments will be linked to quality outcomes through programs such as the hospital value based purchasing and the hospital readmissions reduction programs of these qualitybased payments 50 will be tied to alternate payment models that promote shared savings like accountable care organizations and bundled payment arrangements 

we see other governments around the world considering similar bundling reform measures including the development of the diagnosis related group “drg” as a payment mechanism to drive toward quality and resource based reimbursement 

see item 1a risk factors for a further discussion 

regulation 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

bd actively maintains fdaiso quality systems that establish standards for its product design manufacturing and distribution processes prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of bd’s quality systems as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials these regulatory controls as well as any changes in fda policies can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product 

development and planning processes these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

bd also is subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the united states concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws global anticorruption transportation safety and health and customs and exports many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years this appears to be part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the united states 

in addition as part of ppaca the federal government has enacted the sunshine act provisions requiring bd to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals many of these provisions are new and uncertain and failure to comply could result in a range of fines penalties andor other sanctions 

our infusion pump business unit is operating under an amended consent decree entered into by carefusion with the fda in 2007 carefusion’s consent decree with the fda related to its alaris se infusion pumps in february 2009 carefusion and the fda amended the consent decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for carefusion 303 inc the business unit that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the united states the amended consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories 

while this bd business unit remains subject to the amended consent decree which includes the requirements of the original consent decree it has made substantial progress in its compliance efforts however we cannot predict the outcome of this matter and the amended consent decree authorizes the fda in the event of any violations in the future to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing infusion pumps recall products and take other actions we may be required to pay damages of 15000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree up to 15 million per year 

we also cannot currently predict whether additional monetary investment will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matter’s ultimate impact on our business we may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because among other things the fda may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree andor we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree as of september 30 2015 we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the amended consent decree and accordingly we have no accruals associated with compliance with the amended consent decree

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows 

risks relating to the company 

global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our operations 

in recent years we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions deterioration in the global economic environment particularly in emerging markets and countries with governmentsponsored healthcare systems may result in decreased demand for our products and services increased competition downward pressure on the prices for our products longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply in the future we have also previously experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain countries in western europe and we may experience similar delays in the future in these and other countries or regions experiencing liquidity problems 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

a substantial amount of our revenues are derived from international operations and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the us in the future the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 7 management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks 

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources and by country may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states or abroad changes in reimbursement rates by private payers or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business 

federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

the ppaca was enacted in march 2010 the ppaca imposes on medical device manufacturers such as bd a 23 excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices we cannot predict with any certainty what other impact the ppaca may have on our business the ppaca among other things reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures these factors in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursement rates for our products other provisions in the law may significantly change the practice of health care and could adversely affect aspects of our business 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased health care systems and other health care companies are also consolidating resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies and competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also 

served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has also placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

cost volatility could adversely affect our operations 

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials components freight and energy in particular we purchase supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results increases in the price of oil can also increase our costs for packaging and transportation new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components we may not be able to offset increases in these costs through other cost reductions 

breaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations our information technology systems have been subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes and cyber or phishing attacks and we have experienced instances of unauthorized access to our systems in the past we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future in addition to our own information we store certain information with third parties that could be subject to these types of attacks these attacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being lost or stolen disruption of our operations and other negative consequences such as increased costs for security measures or remediation costs diversion of management attention and adverse impact on our relationships with vendors and customers while we will continue to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of and detect future cyber incidents cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly there can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a significant impact on our business 

our future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers the development of these products requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market approval of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 

we cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

as part of our strategy to increase revenue growth we seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky and the integration of any newlyacquired business requires significant effort and management attention the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 

the medical technology industry is very competitive 

we face significant competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies with multiple product lines some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines we face competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features clinical outcomes product quality price services and other factors in addition we face changing customer preferences and requirements including increased customer demand for more environmentallyfriendly products 

the medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change and discovery the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations has also created pricing pressure particularly in developing markets   

the international operations of our business may subject us to certain business risks 

a substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the united states and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets especially in emerging markets our foreign operations subject us to certain risks including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above the effects of local economic conditions foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements local product preferences and product requirements difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations differing labor regulations changes in tax laws potential political instability weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries import or export licensing requirements trade protection and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders the success of our operations outside the united states depends in part on our ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and sales and distribution networks 

in addition our international operations are governed by the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws outside the us global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more enforcement proceedings by us and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties while we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws our international operations which often involve customer relationships with foreign governments create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments by employees consultants sales agents or distributors any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities and negatively affect our reputation 

under the us tax code we may also be subject to additional taxation to the extent we repatriate earnings from our foreign operations to the us in the event we require more capital in the united states than is generated by our us operations to fund acquisitions or other activities and elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rate may be higher as a result   

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our bd biosciences business 

our bd biosciences business sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and agencies in other countries the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods the availability of governmental research funding may also continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales 

we purchase many different types of raw materials and components certain raw materials and components are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons we elect to purchase certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers the supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of reasons including economic conditions as described above while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products   

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural disasters or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow internal protocols and procedures equipment failure or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products resulting in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers 

we are subject to lawsuits 

we are or have been a defendant in a number of lawsuits including purported class action lawsuits for among other things alleged antitrust violations and suits alleging patent infringement and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in 

item 8 financial statements and supplementary data given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to extensive regulation 

our operations are global and are affected by various state federal and international healthcare environmental antitrust anticorruption fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws employment and other laws violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and in some cases exclusion from participation in health care programs such as medicare and medicaid the enactment of additional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations 

we are also subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of our products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources and these have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda for supporting data for submissions the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable fda and other regulatory requirements continue to be met following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production marketing or sale of our products and result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances closure of manufacturing sites seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation more stringent oversight by the fda and other agencies in recent years has resulted in increased enforcement activity which increases the compliance risk for us and other companies in our industry 

as a result of the carefusion acquisition we are operating under a consent decree with the fda that was entered into by carefusion in 2009 that affects our infusion pump business in the united states for more information regarding the consent decree see “regulation” under item 1 “business” 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unapproved use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products 

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 

many of our businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property assets these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business we can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position in addition competitors may claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property which could result in the payment of significant legal fees damage awards and past or future royalties as well as injunctions against future sales of our products we also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the us which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

natural disasters war and other events could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

natural disasters including pandemics war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts and actions taken by the united states and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events could cause significant 

economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and areas outside of the united states in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers 

we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 

our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected 

risks relating to our acquisition of carefusion   

the integration process with carefusion may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized 

the success of our acquisition of carefusion including anticipated benefits and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our business with the business of carefusion it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees higher than expected costs diversion of management attention and resources the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger as part of the integration process we intend to move assets within our combined company to create efficiencies and may seek to opportunistically divest certain assets of the combined company which may change the profile of the combined company and which may not be possible on favorable terms or at all if we experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected these integration matters could have an adverse effect on the combined company for an undetermined period going forward in addition the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated 

in connection with the carefusion transactions we incurred and assumed significant additional indebtedness which could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility 

we have substantially increased indebtedness following completion of the carefusion acquisition in comparison to that of bd on a recent historical basis which has increased our interest expense and could have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness following the merger and thus the demands on our cash resources is greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the acquisition our increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions funding research and development or future expansion of our business and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for bd relative to other companies with lower debt levels if we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the transaction or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations then our ability to service this indebtedness may be adversely impacted 

certain of the indebtedness incurred in connection with the merger bears interest at variable interest rates if interest rates increase variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements which could adversely affect our cash flows 

in addition our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations our ratings were downgraded in connection with the indebtedness incurred and assumed in the acquisition of carefusion and there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future moreover we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate requirements our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that may affect our ability to operate our businesses 

the agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with the carefusion transaction contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries including carefusion to among other things have liens on their property transact business with affiliates andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person in addition some of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenants that will require us to maintain certain financial ratios our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate our repayment obligations 

uncertainties associated with our carefusion integration efforts may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company 

the successful integration of carefusion and bd will depend in part upon our ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of both companies current and prospective employees of the combined company may experience uncertainty about their future roles during the integration process which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees

acquisition of carefusion 

on march 17 2015 pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on october 5 2014 bd acquired a 100 interest in carefusion for total consideration of approximately 125 billion to create a global leader in medication management and patient safety solutions the operating activities of carefusion from the acquisition date through march 31 2015 were not material to bd’s consolidated results of operations and as such carefusion’s operating results were included in bd’s consolidated results of operations beginning on april 1 2015 carefusion operates as part of our medical segment which now includes the following organizational units in addition to the diabetes care and pharmaceutical systems units medication and procedural solutions which encompasses bd’s former medical surgical systems unit medication management solutions and respiratory solutions additional discussion regarding this acquisition is provided in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data disclosures regarding bd’s financing arrangements relating to this transaction are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

summary of financial results 

worldwide revenues in 2015 of 10282 billion increased 217 from the prior year compared with an increase of 49 in 2014 the components of the total worldwide revenue growth in 2015 and 2014 were as follows 



worldwide revenue growth in 2015 reflected the inclusion of carefusion’s sales in the companys results as of april 1 2015 as discussed above revenue growth in 2015 was also attributable to consistent performance of our legacy products the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio as well as sales in emerging markets medical segment revenue growth in 2015 reflected the inclusion of carefusion’s sales for the second half of the current year growth in the medication and procedural solutions units international sales of safetyengineered products and growth in the diabetes care units sales of pen needles life sciences segment revenue growth in 2015 was largely driven by sales of safetyengineered products in the preanalytical systems unit as well as by growth in the diagnostic systems unit 

revenues in the united states of 5069 billion in 2015 increased 484 from 2014 international revenues in 2015 grew 36 to 5213 billion which includes an estimated unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact of 126 in addition to the inclusion of carefusions sales in results for the second half of the current year us revenue growth reflected strength in the medical segments overall legacy product portfolio the diagnostic systems units benefit from a stronger than normal flu season and growth in the biosciences unit’s research reagent sales and instrument placements in addition to growth attributable to the carefusion acquisition international revenues for 2015 reflected growth from both segments due to sales in emerging markets and of safetyengineered products worldwide sales of safetyengineered products reflected the inclusion of carefusions sales of safetyengineered products for the second half of the fiscal year as well as growth that was attributable to bds legacy safetyengineered products us sales of safetyengineered products in 2015 of 1471 billion increased 218 compared with 2014 and international safetyengineered products revenues of 1128 billion grew 109 which reflected the estimated unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 14 

we continue to invest in research and development geographic expansion and new product promotions to drive further revenue and profit growth our ability to sustain our longterm growth will depend on a number of factors including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion develop innovative new products and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness including the integration of carefusion while the economic environment for the healthcare industry has stabilized pricing pressures continue for some of our products healthcare utilization has stabilized and slightly improved in the united states however any destabilization in the future could adversely impact our us businesses additionally macroeconomic challenges in europe continue to constrain healthcare utilization although we

each reporting period we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period the ongoing strength of the us dollar resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenue growth during the year as discussed above we evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currencyneutral basis which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we calculate foreign currencyneutral percentages by converting our currentperiod local currency financial results using the priorperiod foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our currentperiod reported results from time to time we may purchase forward contracts and options to partially protect against adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on our derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes for further discussion refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

selling and administrative 

aggregate expenses in 2015 reflected the inclusion of carefusion’s selling and administrative expenses in the second half of the current year’s results as well as the depreciation of fixed assets acquired in the carefusion acquisition which were recorded at fair value selling and administrative expense in 2015 was favorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately 138 million aggregate expenses in 2015 also included increased spending of 39 million relating to the expansion of our business in emerging markets as well as a 12 million charge relating to the rti litigation matter as previously discussed

acquisitionrelated costs 

acquisitionrelated costs incurred of 426 million in fiscal year 2015 substantially related to the carefusion acquisition and consisted of transaction integration and restructuring costs of 59 million 95 million and 271 million respectively the transaction and integration costs reflected advisory legal and other costs incurred in connection with the carefusion acquisition the restructuring costs in 2015 reflected employee termination costs sharebased compensation expense asset writeoffs and other restructuring costs relating to the acquisition for further discussion regarding these costs refer to notes 7 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

net interest expense 



the increase in interest expense in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily reflected increased financing costs associated with the carefusion acquisition including interest on 62 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in december 2014 in anticipation of closing the carefusion acquisition interest expense in fiscal year 2015 additionally included commitment fees for a bridge loan facility entered into concurrently with the execution of the agreement to acquire carefusion to ensure our ability to fund the cash portion of consideration due under the acquisition agreement these increases in interest expense in fiscal year 2015 were partially offset by 16 million due to the favorable amortization of the acquisitiondate fair value stepup recorded on carefusion’s longterm debt additional disclosures regarding the debt issuance bridge loan facility and debt assumed are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the decrease in interest expense in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily reflected lower levels of longterm fixedrate debt and a reduction of interest payments through fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements for further discussion regarding these swap arrangements refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the decrease in interest income in 2015 compared with 2014 reflected lower cash levels outside of the united states as well as investment losses on assets related to our deferred compensation plan the offsetting movement in the deferred compensation plan liability was recorded in selling and administrative expense  the increase in interest income in 2014 compared with 2013 reflected higher interest rates on investments outside the united states partially offset by the impact of lower investment gains on assets related to our deferred compensation plan 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate in 2015 was 59 as compared with the 2014 rate of 221 the impact on bd’s income mix of the previously discussed specified items reduced the effective income tax rate in 2015 by 1720 basis points as the tax benefits on these specified items were primarily incurred in higher tax jurisdictions the decrease in the income tax rate in fiscal year 2015 additionally reflected the extension of the us research and development income tax credit which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of onetime discrete items the effective income tax rate in 2014 reflected our decision to change our position of permanent reinvestment with respect to the unremitted earnings of brazil and certain other latin american jurisdictions the impact of which was more than offset by the benefits resulting from discrete onetime items and geographic mix the effective income tax rate in 2013 of 202 reflected the favorable impact from various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions and the reinstatement of the us research and development tax credit partially offset by a lower benefit on foreign earnings 

income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations

financial instrument market risk 

we selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations the counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign exchange risk 

bd and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout europe greater asia canada and latin america we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency these payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions we hedge substantially all such exposures primarily through the use of forward contracts we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations including sales to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period from time to time we may purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future earnings resulting from adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions we did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2015 or 2014 

derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value for foreign currency derivatives market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities 

with respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2015 and 2014 the impact changes in the us dollar would have on pretax earnings was estimated as follows 



these calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments 

interest rate risk 

our primary interest rate risk relates to us dollar borrowings which are partially offset by us dollar cash investments when managing interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments we may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interestbearing investments in tandem since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure for interest rate derivative instruments fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using marketbased observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities at september 30 2015 and 2014 we had interest rate derivative contracts to convert interest payments on certain longterm debt notes from fixed rates to floating rates 

with respect to the interest rate derivatives outstanding at september 30 2015 and 2014 the impact changes in the interest rate would have on the fair value of these derivatives was estimated as follows 



based on our overall interest rate exposure at september 30 2015 and 2014 a 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our earnings or cash flows over a oneyear period 

other risks 

from time to time the company has managed price risks associated with commodity purchases through derivative contracts at september 30 2015 we had cashsettled forward contracts to hedge a portion of our global resin purchase volumes throughout fiscal years 2015 and 2016 a change in the underlying commodity price would not materially affect the value of our commodity derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2015

repurchase of common stock 

there were no share repurchases in 2015 as our share repurchase program was suspended in connection with our announced agreement to acquire carefusion we repurchased approximately 36 million shares of our common stock for 400 million in 2014 and 55 million shares for 450 million in 2013 at september 30 2015 a total of approximately 91 million common shares remained available for purchase under the board of directors’ september 2013 share repurchase authorization 

cash and shortterm investments 

at september 30 2015 total worldwide cash and shortterm investments were 14 billion of which 11 billion was held in jurisdictions outside of the united states we regularly review the amount of cash and shortterm investments held outside the united states and currently intend to use such amounts to fund our international operations and their growth initiatives in addition if these amounts were repatriated from foreign jurisdictions to the united states there could be adverse tax consequences 

credit facilities 

in january 2015 and in connection with our agreement to acquire carefusion we entered into a commercial paper program which allows us to issue a maximum of 1 billion in notes a former commercial paper program which had been in place to meet shortterm financing needs was terminated in february 2015 and the outstanding borrowings of 200 million under the former program were rolled into the new commercial paper program at september 30 2015 subsequent to the completion of the carefusion acquisition on march 17 2015 borrowings outstanding under the current commercial paper program were 700 million also in connection with the carefusion acquisition we entered into a 364day term loan agreement in december 2014 that provided for a 10 billion term loan facility at september 30 2015 the term loan was fully repaid with no borrowings outstanding reflecting principal payments of 650 million 250 million and 100 million made in april july and september 2015 respectively the 91 billion of fully committed bridge financing we secured in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 concurrently with our execution of the agreement to acquire carefusion was terminated upon completion of the acquisition additional disclosures regarding bd’s financing arrangements relating to the carefusion acquisition are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

we have available a 1 billion syndicated credit facility this credit facility under which there were no borrowings outstanding at september 30 2015 provides backup support for our commercial paper program and can also be used for other general corporate purposes it includes a provision that enables bd subject to additional commitments made by the lenders to access up to an additional 500 million in financing through the facility for a maximum aggregate commitment of 15 billion during the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 we extended the expiration date of this credit facility to may 2018 from the original expiration date of may 2017 the credit facility includes a single financial covenant that requires bd to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio ratio of earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less 

than 5to1 for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters we were in compliance with this covenant as of september 30 2015 in addition we have informal lines of credit outside the united states 

carefusion debt assumed 

upon the closing of the carefusion acquisition in march 2015 bd assumed senior unsecured notes issued by carefusion with an aggregate principal amount of 2 billion subsequent to closing the acquisition bd commenced offers to exchange these carefusion notes for notes issued by bd and this exchange offer expired in april 2015 additional disclosures regarding this exchange offer are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

access to capital and credit ratings 

our ability to generate cash flow from operations issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms could be adversely affected in the event there was a material decline in the demand for our products deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions 

bd’s credit ratings at september 30 2015 were as follows 



subsequent to bd’s announcement regarding our acquisition of carefusion the two major corporate debt rating organizations moody’s investors service moody’s and standard  poor’s ratings services sp provided guidance that they expected to downgrade our debt ratings as a result of the anticipated increase in bd’s net leverage in december 2014 sp downgraded bd’s longterm debt and commercial paper ratings from a to bbb and from a1 to a2 respectively following our announced completion of the carefusion acquisition on march 17 2015 moody’s converted its provisional downgrade of bd’s longterm debt rating from a3 to baa2 to a definitive downgrade concurrently with these downgrade actions bd’s ratings with both sp and moody’s were removed from further review 

bd’s credit ratings remain investment grade after these downgrades as such we do not expect these downgrades to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our strong balance sheet our syndicated credit facility and our commercial paper program while such downgrades in our credit ratings may increase the costs associated with maintaining and borrowing under our existing credit arrangements the downgrades do not affect our ability to draw on these credit facilities nor do they result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any outstanding debt we believe that given our debt ratings our financial management policies our ability to generate cash flow and the noncyclical geographically diversified nature of our businesses we would have access to additional shortterm and longterm capital should the need arise a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change 

contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future the table below sets forth bd’s significant contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of september 30 2015 



  

 critical accounting policies 

the following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

some of our sales transactions qualify as multipleelement arrangements which require us to identify separate units of accounting within the arrangement and allocate the transaction consideration across these separate accounting units for arrangements that include software and nonsoftware elements the transaction consideration is allocated to the software elements as a group as well as to the individual nonsoftware elements that have been separately identified the identification of accounting units and the allocation of total transaction consideration for multipleelement arrangements may be subjective and requires a degree of management judgment management’s judgments relative to multipleelement arrangements may significantly affect the timing of revenue recognition 

transaction consideration for separately identified nonsoftware units of accounting within an arrangement is recognized upon the completion of each deliverable based on its relative selling price when applying the relative selling price method the selling price of each deliverable is determined based upon the following hierarchy of evidence vendorspecific objective evidence which is generally based upon historical prices in standalone transactions thirdparty evidence which is generally based on market data on sales of similar products and services if available and management’s best estimate of selling price management’s best estimate of selling price is generally based upon the following considerations standalone sales prices established price lists costs to produce profit margins for similar products market conditions and customer stratification 

for software and softwarerelated products we use the relative fair value method to allocate transaction consideration to each unit of accounting whereby the evidence used in the determination of fair value estimates are based solely on vendorspecific objective evidence to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for delivered elements of the transaction we apply the residual method 

the revenue allocated to equipment or instruments in multipleelement arrangements is recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer the revenue allocated to extended warranty contracts and software maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized as these deliverables are performed under the arrangement the majority of deferred revenue relating to extended warranty contracts is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over several years

our accounting for salestype leases is based upon certain assumptions including the economic life of our leased products and the fair value of our leased products which is used to determine the interest rate implicit to the lease these assumptions affect that amount of gross investment in the lease unearned income and the sales price that is recognized relative to each salestype lease transaction based upon our anticipation of future technological advances of our products or that of our competitors the economic life of our leased products is five years as this is the estimated period during which the leased product is expected to be economically usable without limitation by the lease term additionally five years represents the most frequent contractual lease term for our leased products our product configurations are customized for each customer’s specifications and as such there is no significant aftermarket for our used equipment residual values if any are established at lease inception using estimates of the fair value of reclaimable component parts of the products at the end of the lease term 

the fair value of our leased products is estimated on a quarterly basis based upon transacted cash sales prices during the preceding 12month period and represents normal selling price reflecting any volume or trade discounts that may apply because our products are sold as part of customized systems to a diverse range of customers many of which are affiliated with a group purchasing organization or integrated delivery network there is a wide range of negotiated cash selling prices for our products accordingly we stratify our cash selling transactions based on product configuration and customer class to determine a best estimate of fair value for each product specific within determined customer classes based upon this stratification we calculate the weighted average selling price of each configured product using the interquartile range methodology and remove outliers from the population of normal cash selling prices which narrows the range of selling prices within each stratified customer class the resulting weighted average selling price is the single point estimate of fair value that we use as the normal selling price and this fair value estimate is used to determine the implicit interest rate for each product subject to a salestype lease arrangement in certain instances we do not have sufficient corresponding historical cash selling transactions to support fair values of specific combinations of product configurations and customer classes in these instances fair value is estimated by applying the average discount percentage given to the respective customer class over the trailing 12 months to the list price of the products whose fair value was not determined using the interquartile range methodology described above the resulting fair values is then used to derive the implicit rate of the lease the interest rate implicit to the lease is then used to determine the amount of revenue recognized at the inception of the lease and the revenue recognized over the life of the lease 

our net investment in salestype leases primarily arises from the leasing of dispensing equipment and as such the methodology for determining the relating allowance for credit losses is based on the collective population and is not stratified by class or portfolio segment the allowance for credit losses is based on historical experience loss rates as well as on management’s judgments regarding the potential impact of anticipated changes in business practices market dynamics and economic conditions these assumptions are inherently subjective and it is possible that we will experience actual credit losses that are different from our current estimates 

accounting for software products 

we sell and lease products with embedded software and as such we must evaluate these products to determine if industryspecific revenue recognition requirements apply to these sales transactions this evaluation process is often complex and subject to significant judgment if software is considered not essential to the nonsoftware elements of a product but is considered more than incidental to a product as a whole the product’s software elements must be separated from its nonsoftware elements under the requirements relating to multipleelement arrangements the product’s software elements must be accounted for under software industryspecific revenue recognition requirements and the application of these requirements may significantly affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized 

we have determined that the software embedded within our infusion products when sold with safety software patient identification products and certain diagnostic equipment as well as the software embedded within our research and clinical instruments sold by our biosciences unit is more than incidental to these product offerings as a whole however we have determined that the nonsoftware elements and software elements in these product offerings work together to deliver the essential functionality of these products as a whole as such the accounting for these product offerings does not fall within the scope of software industryspecific accounting requirements we have determined the embedded software within certain other products primarily dispensing and respiratory products is incidental to the products as a whole and therefore the accounting for these products also falls outside the scope of softwarespecific requirements generally our standalone software application sales and any related postcontract support related to these sales are accounted for under the software industryspecific revenue recognition requirements 

impairment of assets 

goodwill and inprocess research and development assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with finite lives including developed technology and other longlived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units generally represent one level below reporting segments and we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics potential impairment of goodwill is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value our annual goodwill impairment test performed on july 1 2015 did not result in any impairment charges as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value we reassessed our reporting units upon the previously discussed realignment of bd’s organizational structure from a threesegment to a twosegment structure on october 1 2014 and upon our acquisition of carefusion on march 17 2015 while the segment realignment did not change bds reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing the reporting units within the medical segment were redefined as a result of the carefusion acquisition 

we generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with bd’s business plans the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and potentially result in different impacts to bd’s results of operations actual results may differ from management’s estimates 

income taxes 

bd maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 

bd conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions our past audit experience with similar situations and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters bd’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if upon resolution with taxing authorities we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

bd has reviewed its needs in the us for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and with exception for certain countries continues to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the us to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property plant and equipment expenditure needs deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested at september 30 2015 the cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the united states was 75 billion the determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation 

contingencies 

we are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including without limitation product liability antitrust and environmental matters as further discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses we establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries a determination of the amount of accruals if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue and when appropriate is developed after consultation with outside counsel the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows 

benefit plans 

we have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations these benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate pension benefit costs also include an assumption for the expected return on plan assets these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

the discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date september 30 specifically for the us pension plan we will use a discount rate of 415 for 2016 which was based on an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date to calculate the pension expense in 2016 we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2016 are provided in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption although reviewed each year changes less frequently due to the longterm nature of the assumption this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date rather it is used only in the calculation of pension expense to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider many factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results benchmark data expected returns on various plan asset classes as well as current and expected asset allocations we will use a longterm expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 750 for the us pension plan in 2016 we believe our discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our us pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows 

 sharebased compensation 

compensation cost relating to sharebased payment transactions is recognized in net income using a fair value measurement method all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options are recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense based on their fair values over the vesting period of the awards we determine the fair value of certain sharebased awards using a latticebased binomial option valuation model that incorporates certain assumptions such as the riskfree interest rate expected volatility expected dividend yield and expected life of the options see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

bd and its representatives may from time to time make certain forwardlooking statements in publicly released materials both written and oral including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission press releases and our reports to shareholders forwardlooking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan” “expect” “believe” “intend” “will” “anticipate” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with among other things discussions of future operations and financial performance as well as our strategy for growth product development regulatory approvals market position and expenditures all statements that address operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to volume growth sales and earnings per share growth cash flows or uses and statements expressing views about future operating results — are forwardlooking statements 

forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations of future events the forwardlooking statements are and will be based on management’s thencurrent views and assumptions regarding future events developments and operating performance and speak only as of their dates investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements furthermore we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information future events and developments or otherwise except as required by applicable law or regulations 

the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements for further discussion of certain of these factors see item 1a risk factors 

 32 

 the foregoing list sets forth many but not all of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forwardlooking statements investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties

foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues bd believes its activities in some countries outside the united states involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein as well as the economic environment local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties see further discussion of this risk in item 1a risk factors 

distribution 

bd’s products are marketed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to endusers by bd and independent sales representatives order backlog is not material to bd’s business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock bd’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the bd medical segment and respiratory and flu diagnostic products in the bd diagnostics segment which relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza 

  

raw materials 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products bd seeks to ensure continuity of raw material supply by securing multiple options for sourcing however there are situations where raw materials are only available from one supplier which are referred to as sole sourced the use of sole sourced materials may be due to sourcing of proprietary andor patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product in other cases while a raw material can be sourced from multiple manufacturers only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance cost or other considerations in order to provide alternate sources of raw materials bd must complete a rigorous qualification process which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval if clinical trials are not required this qualification process can take 318 months depending on the criticality of the change when clinical trials are required this process may lengthen the qualification phase from one to three years bd continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and maintains business continuity plans with our suppliers bd’s continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities maintaining contingency stock internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts while bd works closely with its suppliers there may nonetheless be events that cause supply interruption reduction or termination that adversely impacts bd’s ability to manufacture and sell certain products 

research and development 

bd conducts its research and development “rd” activities at its operating units and at bd technologies in research triangle park north carolina the majority of bd’s rd activities are conducted in the united states outside the united states bd’s businesses conduct rd activities in canada china france india and singapore bd also collaborates with certain universities medical centers and other entities on rd programs and retains individual consultants to support its efforts in specialized fields bd spent approximately 550 million 494 million and 472 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

intellectual property and licenses 

bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bd’s business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bd’s business as a whole or to any business segment 

competition 

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment in addition the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations are creating increased pricing pressures particularly in developing markets some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs 

  

bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement in support of its core strategy — to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers 

thirdparty reimbursement 

most of our customers and healthcare providers typically rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures products and services they provide our devices are subject to worldwide regulations regarding reimbursement developed by government agencies including the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms in the united states the national health service in the united kingdom the joint federal committee in germany the commission d’evaluation des produits et prestations in france the ministry for health labor and welfare in japan the ministry of health and the national development and reform commission in china among many others in addition our devices are also subject to reimbursement policies issued by private insurance companies and managed care organizations the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer’s discretion the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of these thirdparty payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products thus changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products 

while bd is actively engaged in promoting the value propositions of its products for payer provider and patient stakeholders and it employs various efforts and resources to positively impact coverage coding and payment processes in this regard it has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and payment levels for bd products many thirdparty payers are seeking to control the growth of healthcare expenditures and have developed specific payment and delivery mechanisms to support these cost control efforts these mechanisms include payment reductions pay for performance measures qualitybased performance payments restrictive coverage policies bidding and tender mechanics studies to compare the effectiveness of therapies and use of technology assessments these changes have created an increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective and qualitydriven healthcare as government programs including cms and many other national healthcare programs seek to expand healthcare coverage for their citizens they have at the same time sought to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures products or services 

as bd’s product offerings are diverse across many healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment systems therefore individual countries product lines or product classes may be impacted by changes to these systems notably the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” provides for numerous substantive changes to us healthcare payment systems the law focuses on medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs the medicare provisions include valuebased payment programs increased funding of comparative effectiveness research reduced hospital payments for avoidable readmissions and healthcare acquired conditions and infections new programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies that promote care coordination such as accountable care organizations and bundled physician and hospital payments have been established and will continue to be implemented during the next several years that could impact the value and payment for our products see item 1a risk factors for a further discussion 

regulation 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

  

bd actively maintains fdaiso quality systems that establish standards for its product design manufacturing and distribution processes prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews of bd’s quality systems as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials these regulatory controls as well as any changes in fda policies can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

bd also is subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the united states concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws global anticorruption transportation safety and health and customs and exports many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years this appears to be part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the united states 

in addition as part of ppaca the federal government has enacted the sunshine act provisions beginning in 2013 we are required to track and in 2014 publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals many of these requirements are new and uncertain and failure to comply could result in a range of fines penalties andor other sanctions 

bd believes it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable law and the regulations promulgated by the applicable agencies including without limitation environmental laws and regulations and that such compliance has not had and will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or results see item 3 legal proceedings 

employees 

as of september 30 2014 bd had 30619 employees of whom 11965 were employed in the us including puerto rico bd believes that its employee relations are satisfactory

forwardlooking statements 

bd and its representatives may from timetotime make certain forwardlooking statements in publiclyreleased materials both written and oral including statements contained in filings with the sec and in its reports to shareholders additional information regarding bd’s forwardlooking statements is contained in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows 

global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our operations 

in recent years we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions particularly in the us and western europe deterioration in the global economic environment may result in decreased demand for our products and services increased competition downward pressure on the prices for our products longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply in the future we have also experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain countries in western europe and we may experience similar delays in these and other countries or regions experiencing liquidity problems while we have not experienced a slowing of growth in emerging markets as other companies in our industry have reported there can be no assurance that a deterioration of economic conditions in these markets will not adversely affect our future results 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

about 60 of our fiscal year 2014 revenues were derived from international operations and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the us in the future the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 7 management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks 

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources and by country may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states or abroad or changes in reimbursement rates by private payers could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using bd products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business 

federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” was enacted in march 2010 under the ppaca beginning in 2013 medical device manufacturers such as bd pay a 23 excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices we cannot predict with any certainty what other impact the ppaca may have on our business the ppaca among other things reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals clinical 

  

laboratories and pharmaceutical companies and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures these factors in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursement rates for our products other provisions in the law may significantly change the practice of health care and could adversely affect aspects of our business while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the united states the overall increase in access to healthcare has not had any discernable impact on sales of bd’s products 

efforts to reduce the us federal deficit could adversely affect our results of operations 

the budget control act of 2011 implements automatic spending cuts known as sequestration designed to reduce government spending by over 1 trillion over a ten year period beginning in 2013 and will remain in effect in the absence of further legislative action half of the automatic reductions will come from nondefense discretionary spending and domestic entitlement programs including reductions in payments to medicare providers government research funding has also been reduced as a result of sequestration such reductions in government healthcare spending or research funding could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure further there is ongoing uncertainty regarding the federal budget and federal spending levels including the possible impacts of a failure to increase the “debt ceiling” any us government default on its debt could have broad macroeconomic effects that could among other things raise our borrowing costs any future shutdown of the federal government or failure to enact annual appropriations could also have a material adverse impact on our business 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

the medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has also placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

cost volatility could adversely affect our operations 

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials components freight and energy in particular bd purchases supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results increases in the price of oil can also increase bd’s costs for packaging and transportation new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of certain raw materials and components we may not be able to offset increases in these costs through other cost reductions 

breaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations our information technology systems have been subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access and cyber or phishingattacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future we also store certain information with third parties that could be subject to these types of attacks these attacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being lost or stolen disruption of our operations and other negative consequences such as increased costs for security measures or remediation costs and diversion of management attention while we will continue to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of and detect future cyber incidents cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly there can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a significant impact on our business 

  

bd’s future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers the development of these products requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including bd’s ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market approval of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 

we cannot guarantee that any of bd’s strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

as part of our strategy to increase revenue growth we seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 

for additional information regarding risks relating to our pending acquisition of carefusion see the risk factors below under the heading “risks relating to our pending acquisition of carefusion” 

the medical technology industry is very competitive 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological change in addition we face changing customer preferences and requirements including increased customer demand for more environmentallyfriendly products we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features clinical outcomes price services and other factors we face this competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies with multiple product lines some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations has also created pricing pressure particularly in developing markets some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs 

the international operations of bd’s business may subject bd to certain business risks 

the majority of our sales come from our operations outside the united states and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets especially in emerging markets bd’s foreign operations subject bd to certain risks including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above the effects of local economic conditions foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements local product preferences and product requirements difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations differing labor regulations changes in tax laws potential political instability trade barriers weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries trade protection and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders the success of our operations outside the united states depends in part on our ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and sales and distribution networks 

  

in addition our international operations are governed by the foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more enforcement proceedings by us and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties while we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws our international operations create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments by employees consultants sales agents or distributors any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government scrutiny severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities and negatively affect our reputation 

under the us tax code we may also be subject to additional taxation to the extent we repatriate earnings from our foreign operations to the us in the event we require more capital in the united states than is generated by our us operations to fund acquisitions or other activities and elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rate may be higher as a result 

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our bd biosciences business 

our bd biosciences business sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and agencies in other countries the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods the availability of governmental research funding may also continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions and as described above governmental spending reductions any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect bd’s manufacturing operations and related product sales 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials and components certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences business and components are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons bd elects to purchase certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers the supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of reasons including economic conditions as described above while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants weather natural disasters including pandemics terrorism political change failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures equipment malfunction environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products resulting in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers 

bd is subject to lawsuits 

bd is or has been a defendant in a number of lawsuits including purported class action lawsuits for among other things alleged antitrust violations and suits alleging patent infringement and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in item 3 legal proceedings 

  

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s results of operations and cash flows 

for additional information regarding litigation relating to our pending acquisition of carefusion see the risk factors below under the heading “risks relating to our pending acquisition of carefusion” 

bd is subject to extensive regulation 

bd’s operations are global and are affected by various state federal and international healthcare environmental antitrust anticorruption fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws and employment laws violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and in some cases exclusion from participation in health care programs such as medicare and medicaid bd is also subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of bd’s products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources and these have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda for supporting data for submissions the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable fda and other regulatory requirements continue to be met 

following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production marketing or sale of our products and result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances closure of manufacturing sites seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation recent changes in enforcement practice by the fda and other agencies have resulted in increased enforcement activity which increases the compliance risk for bd and other companies in our industry 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unapproved use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products 

we may experience difficulties fully implementing our enterprise resource planning system 

we have been engaged in a project to upgrade our enterprise resource planning “erp” system our erp system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records record transactions provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements the implementation of the new erp system has required and will continue to require the investment of significant financial and human resources in addition we may not be able to successfully complete the full implementation of the erp system without experiencing difficulties any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new 

  

erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 

many of bd’s businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property assets these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business bd can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position in addition competitors may claim that bd products infringe upon their intellectual property which could result in significant legal fees damage awards royalties and injunctions against future sales of our products the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

natural disasters war and other events could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

natural disasters including pandemics war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts and actions taken by the united states and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and in areas outside of the united states in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers 

we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 

our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense bd’s ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected 

risks relating to our pending acquisition of carefusion 

completion of the merger is subject to conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived the merger will not be completed 

the obligations of bd and carefusion to complete the merger are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions including adoption of the merger by the carefusion stockholders the adoption or deemed adoption of approvals of the merger by the european commission the effectiveness of our registration statement on form s4 filed with the sec with respect to our common stock to be issued in the merger approval of the listing on the nyse of the bd common stock to be issued in the merger and the absence of an injunction prohibiting the merger each party’s obligation to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver to the extent permitted under applicable law of certain other conditions the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party under the merger agreement subject to the materiality standards set forth in the merger agreement the performance by the other party of its respective obligations under the merger agreement in all material respects and delivery of officer certificates by the other party certifying satisfaction of the two preceding conditions 

the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring any delay in completing the merger could cause bd not to realize some or all of the benefits that bd expects to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the merger will be satisfied or waived or that the merger will be completed the market price for our stock may reflect an assumption that the pending merger will occur and the failure to complete the merger could result in a decline in our stock price 

  

in order to complete the merger bd and carefusion must make certain governmental filings and obtain certain governmental authorizations and if such filings and authorizations are not made or granted or are granted with conditions completion of the merger may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the merger could be reduced 

although bd and carefusion have agreed in the merger agreement to use reasonable best efforts subject to certain limitations to make certain governmental filings obtain notice of the adoption or deemed adoption of approvals of the merger by the european commission there can be no assurance that the european commission will approve of the merger as a condition to adoption of approvals of the merger governmental authorities may impose requirements limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of bd’s business after completion of the merger 

under the terms of the merger agreement subject to certain exceptions bd and its subsidiaries are required to accept certain conditions and take certain actions imposed by governmental authorities that would apply to or affect the businesses assets or properties of it its subsidiaries or carefusion and its subsidiaries there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions terms obligations or restrictions and that such conditions terms obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of i delaying completion of the merger ii imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger or iii otherwise adversely affecting bd’s businesses and results of operations after completion of the merger in addition we can provide no assurance that these conditions terms obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger 

combining the two companies may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized 

carefusion and bd have operated and until the completion of the merger will continue to operate independently the success of the merger including anticipated benefits and cost savings will depend in part on bd’s ability to successfully combine and integrate our business with the business of carefusion it is possible that the pendency of the merger andor the integration process could result in the loss of key employees higher than expected costs diversion of management attention of both carefusion and bd the disruption of either company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger as part of the integration process we may also attempt to divest certain assets of the combined company which may not be possible on favorable terms or at all or if successful may change the profile of the combined company if bd experiences difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources these integration matters could have an adverse effect on i each of bd and carefusion during this transition period and ii the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of the merger in addition the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated 

in connection with the merger bd will incur significant additional indebtedness and will assume certain of carefusion’s outstanding indebtedness which could adversely affect bd including by decreasing bd’s business flexibility and will increase its interest expense 

the total debt of bd as of september 30 2014 was approximately 4 billion bd’s pro forma indebtedness as of september 30 2014 after giving effect to the merger and the anticipated incurrence and extinguishment of indebtedness in connection therewith will be as much as 14 billion bd will have substantially increased indebtedness following completion of the merger in comparison to that of bd on a recent historical basis which could have the effect among other things of reducing bd’s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing bd’s interest expense bd will also incur various costs and expenses associated with the financing the amount of cash required to pay interest on bd’s increased indebtedness levels following completion of the merger and thus the demands on bd’s cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service the indebtedness of bd prior to the transaction the increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the merger could also reduce funds available for working capital capital 

  

expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for bd relative to other companies with lower debt levels if bd does not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the merger or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations then bd’s ability to service its indebtedness may be adversely impacted 

certain of the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the merger may bear interest at variable interest rates if interest rates increase variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements which could adversely affect bd’s cash flows 

in addition bd’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly bd’s cost of capital bd’s ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of bd’s financial strength operating performance and ability to meet bd’s debt obligations in connection with the debt financing for the merger it is anticipated that bd will seek ratings of its indebtedness from one or more nationally recognized statistical organizations there can be no assurance that bd will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

in the event that the ratings of carefusion’s existing notes are reduced beyond certain thresholds within certain time periods prior to or following the consummation of the merger carefusion could be required to offer to repurchase such notes at 101 of the principal amount of such notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date 

moreover bd may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate requirements bd’s ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors bd’s financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond bd’s control there can be no assurance that bd will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to bd or at all 

the agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred or assumed in connection with the merger contain various covenants that impose restrictions on bd and certain of its subsidiaries that may affect their ability to operate their businesses 

the agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred or assumed in connection with the merger contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict the ability of bd and certain of its subsidiaries to among other things have liens on their property transact business with affiliates andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person in addition some of the agreements that govern the debt financing may contain financial covenants that will require bd to maintain certain financial ratios the ability of bd and its subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond their control failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate bd’s repayment obligations 

the merger will be dilutive to bd’s earnings per share measured on a gaap basis 

because shares of bd common stock will be issued in the merger the merger will be dilutive to bd earnings per share measured on a gaap basis future events and conditions could increase the dilution that is currently projected including adverse changes in market conditions additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the merger any dilution of or delay of any accretion to bd’s earnings per share could cause the price of shares of bd common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate 

the merger will involve substantial costs 

carefusion and bd have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the merger and combining the operations of the two companies the substantial majority of non recurring expenses will be comprised of transaction and regulatory costs related to the merger 

bd also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs bd continues to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the merger and the integration of 

  

the two companies’ businesses although bd expects that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow bd to offset integrationrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all see the risk factor entitled “—combining the two companies may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized” above 

sales of shares of bd common stock after the completion of the transaction may cause the market price of bd common stock to fall 

based on the number of outstanding shares of carefusion common stock as of october 3 2014 bd would issue approximately 16 million shares of bd common stock in connection with the transaction many carefusion stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of bd common stock they will receive in the merger other carefusion stockholders such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers may be required to sell the shares of bd common stock that they receive in the merger such sales of bd common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for bd common stock and may take place promptly following the merger 

lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed against carefusion its directors bd and merger corp challenging the merger and an adverse ruling in such lawsuits may prevent the merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe 

carefusion its directors and bd are named as defendants in eight putative class action lawsuits brought by purported carefusion stockholders challenging the proposed merger and seeking among other things equitable relief to enjoin consummation of the merger rescission of the merger andor rescissory damages one of the conditions to the completion of the merger is that no injunction by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction will be in effect that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the merger as such if any of the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the merger then such injunction may prevent the merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe 

uncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees of carefusion or bd which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company following the merger 

carefusion and bd are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key employees to execute their business plans the combined company’s success after the merger will depend in part upon its ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of carefusion and bd current and prospective employees of carefusion and bd may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the merger which may materially adversely affect the ability of each of carefusion and bd to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the merger accordingly no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees of carefusion and bd

 item 3 legal proceedings 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally bd is not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which bd is a party in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles bd establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries in view of the uncertainties discussed below bd could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows 

bd was named as a defendant in the following purported class action suits brought on behalf of indirect purchasers of bd’s products such as hospitals and retailers the “hospital plaintiffs” alleging that bd violated federal and state antitrust laws resulting in the charging of higher prices for bd’s products to the plaintiffs and other purported class members 

 

   

the plaintiffs in each of the above antitrust class action lawsuits sought monetary damages these antitrust class action lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial purposes in a multidistrict litigation in federal court in new jersey 

pursuant to a settlement agreement that bd entered into with the hospital plaintiffs on july 30 2013 and following approval by the new jersey district court on a preliminary basis in november 2013 and on a final basis in march 2014 bd has paid 22 million in exchange for a release by all potential class members of the indirect purchaser claims related to the products and acts enumerated in the complaint and a dismissal of the case with prejudice

 our strategy focuses on four specific areas within healthcare and life sciences 

 

  

  

  

 we continue to strive to improve the efficiency of our capital structure and follow these guiding principles

summary of financial results 

worldwide revenues in 2014 of 8446 billion increased 49 from the prior year compared with an increase of 45 in 2013 the components of the total worldwide revenue growth in 2014 and 2013 were as follows 

 

 significant drivers of worldwide revenue growth in 2014 included new product sales and sales in emerging markets strong medical segment revenue growth in 2014 was driven by emerging market and international safety sales as well as by sales of insulin pen needles diagnostics revenue growth in 2014 reflected strong sales of safetyengineered products as well as solid sales of automated diagnostic platforms and automated microbiology systems diagnostics revenue growth continues to be unfavorably impacted by continued weaker sales of our women’s health and cancer platform our biosciences segment’s revenue growth in 2014 was driven primarily by doubledigit growth of sales in emerging markets and strong clinical reagent sales in all regions 

  

revenues in the united states of 3417 billion in 2014 increased 19 from 2013 international revenues in 2014 grew 70 to 5029 billion which reflected an estimated unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact of 06 us revenue growth in 2014 reflected strong medical and biosciences revenue growth which was partially offset by the ongoing weaker demand in the diagnostics segment’s women’s health and cancer platform sales of safetyengineered products in the united states were 12 billion international revenues for 2014 reflected growth from all segments including growth attributable to emerging markets as well as strong sales of safetyengineered products international safetyengineered products revenues of 1016 billion grew 108 including an estimated unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 15 reflecting strong performance in western europe and emerging markets 

we continue to invest in research and development geographic expansion and new product promotions to drive further revenue and profit growth our ability to sustain our longterm growth will depend on a number of factors including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion develop innovative new products and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness while the economic environment for the healthcare industry has stabilized pricing pressures continue for some of our products healthcare utilization has continued to stabilize in the united states however any destabilization could adversely impact our us businesses additionally macroeconomic challenges in europe continue to constrain healthcare utilization although we currently view the environment as stable in emerging markets the company’s growth is dependent on government funding for healthcare systems 

in addition to the economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere numerous other factors can affect our ability to achieve our goals including without limitation increased competition and healthcare reform initiatives for example the us patient protection affordable care act contains the medical device excise tax that imposed a 23 tax on certain us sales of medical devices this tax became effective at the beginning of bd’s second quarter of fiscal year 2013 as a result this tax incrementally increased selling and administrative expense by 14 million in 2014 compared with 2013 and by 40 million in 2013 compared with 2012 

our financial position remains strong with cash flows from operating activities totaling 175 billion in 2014 at september 30 2014 we had 274 billion in cash and equivalents and shortterm investments also we continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends during 2014 we repurchased 400 million of our common stock and paid cash dividends of 421 million no share repurchases are planned in 2015 as our share repurchase program has been suspended in connection with the announced agreement to acquire carefusion 

each reporting period we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period we evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currencyneutral basis which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we calculate foreign currencyneutral percentages by converting our currentperiod local currency financial results using the priorperiod foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our currentperiod reported results from time to time we may purchase forward contracts and options to partially protect against adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on our derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes for further discussion refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

foreign exchange risk 

bd and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout europe asia pacific canada japan and latin america we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency these payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions we hedge substantially all such exposures primarily through the use of forward contracts we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations including sales to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period from time to time we may purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future earnings resulting from adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions we did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows in fiscal year 2014 or 2013 

derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value for foreign currency derivatives market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities 

with respect to the derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2014 and 2013 the impact changes in the us dollar would have on pretax earnings was estimated as follows 

 

   

these calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments 

interest rate risk 

our primary interest rate risk relates to us dollar borrowings which are partially offset by us dollar cash investments when managing interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments we may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interestbearing investments in tandem since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure for interest rate derivative instruments fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using marketbased observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities at september 30 2014 we had interest rate derivative contracts to convert interest payments on certain longterm debt notes from fixed rates to floating rates there were no outstanding interest rate derivative contracts as of september 30 2013 an increase of 10 in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the interest rate derivatives at september 30 2014 by approximately 6 million a 10 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of these same interest rate derivatives at september 30 2014 by approximately 6 million based on our overall interest rate exposure at september 30 2014 and 2013 a 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our earnings or cash flows over a oneyear period 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash flows from continuing operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 175 billion 172 billion and 169 billion in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively and was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations as adjusted for depreciation and amortization the 2014 change in operating assets and liabilities was a net use of cash and primarily reflected higher levels of inventory and prepaid expenses partially offset by higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses the 2014 change in operating liabilities included the payment of 22 million under a settlement agreement related to indirect purchaser antitrust class action cases for further discussion regarding this matter refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the change in accounts receivable includes a 36 million payment of government receivables balances in spain further discussion regarding government receivables is provided in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2014 was reduced by changes in the pension obligation resulting primarily from discretionary cash contributions of 75 million an additional discretionary contribution of 40 million was made to the us pension plan in october 2014 

the net change in working capital in 2013 was primarily driven by an increase in accrued payables reflecting the charge from the rti litigation verdict partially offset by higher inventory levels and prepaid expenses net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2013 was reduced by changes in the pension obligation resulting primarily from discretionary cash contributions of approximately 138 million 

net cash flows from continuing investing activities 

capital expenditures 

our investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities and support our strategy of geographic expansion with select investments in growing markets capital spending in 2014 2013 and 2012 related primarily to manufacturing capacity expansions and details of spending by segment are contained in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

acquisitions of businesses 

cash outflows relating to acquisitions were 40 million 136 million and 103 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively cash outflows relating to acquisitions in 2014 represented cash paid to acquire alverix inc in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 cash outflows in 2013 included 124 million relating to the safety syringes acquisition and 14 million associated with the cato acquisition in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2013 respectively cash outflows in 2012 were comprised of 51 million relating to the kiestra acquisition and 52 million associated with the acquisition of sirigen for further discussion refer to note 9 to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

divestiture 

the cash inflow from divestiture of businesses in 2013 represents the first quarter fiscal year 2013 divestiture of the biosciences’ discovery labware unit excluding its advanced bioprocessing platform we received approximately 740 million in total gross proceeds from the sale for further discussion refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

net cash flows from continuing financing activities 

payments of obligations and debt issuances 

in 2013 net cash used for financing activities reflected the repayment of 200 million of 455 notes due on april 15 2013 in 2012 net cash provided by financing activities included the proceeds from 500 million of 5year 175 notes and 1 billion of 10year 3125 notes issued on november 3 2011 total debt was 4 billion at september 2014 2013 and 2012 measures relating to this debt are as follows 

 

  

 repurchase of common stock 

we repurchased approximately 36 million shares of our common stock for 400 million in 2014 55 million shares for 450 million in 2013 and 199 million shares for 15 billion in 2012 at september 30 2014 a total of approximately 91 million common shares remained available for purchase under the board of directors’ september 2013 share repurchase authorization however no share repurchases are planned in 2015 as our share repurchase program has been suspended in connection with the announced agreement to acquire carefusion 

cash and shortterm investments 

at september 30 2014 total worldwide cash and shortterm investments were 274 billion of which 217 billion was held in jurisdictions outside of the united states we regularly review the amount of cash and shortterm investments held outside the united states and currently intend to use most of such amounts to fund our international operations and their growth initiatives however if these amounts were moved out of these jurisdictions or repatriated to the united states there could be adverse tax consequences as discussed above for brazil and certain other latin american jurisdictions a decision was made in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 to change our position of indefinite reinvestment as it relates to their unremitted earnings as of september 30 2014 we have not repatriated any of these earnings 

credit facilities 

we have in place a commercial paper borrowing program that is available to meet our shortterm financing needs including working capital requirements borrowings outstanding under this program were 200 million at 

  

september 30 2014 we have available a 1 billion syndicated credit facility this credit facility under which there were no borrowings outstanding at september 30 2014 provides backup support for our commercial paper program and can also be used for other general corporate purposes it includes a provision that enables bd subject to additional commitments made by the lenders to access up to an additional 500 million in financing through the facility for a maximum aggregate commitment of 15 billion during the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 we extended the expiration date of this credit facility to may 2018 from the original expiration date of may 2017 the credit facility includes a single financial covenant that requires bd to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio ratio of earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 5to1 for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters we were in compliance with this covenant as of september 30 2014 in addition we have informal lines of credit outside the united states 

the consideration to be paid under bd’s definitive agreement to acquire carefusion as previously discussed will include 

 

  

 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 23 billion to partially hedge interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of senior unsecured notes 

access to capital and credit ratings 

our ability to generate cash flow from operations issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms could be adversely affected in the event there was a material decline in the demand for our products deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions 

bd’s credit ratings at september 30 2014 were as follows 

 

 based upon our intention to finance our fiscal year 2015 acquisition of carefusion in large part with the issuance of senior unsecured notes standard  poor’s placed bd’s longterm debt rating of a on creditwatch reflecting its expectation of a future downgrade as a result of the anticipated increase in net leverage if the transaction is consummated moody’s placed bd’s longterm debt rating of a3 on its watchlist reflecting its expectation of a potential future downgrade upon consummation of the transaction even in the event of such downgrades bd’s credit ratings will still remain investment grade as such we do not expect these negative watches to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our strong balance sheet our syndicated credit facility and our commercial paper program while such downgrades in our credit ratings would increase the costs associated with maintaining and borrowing under our existing credit arrangements the downgrades would not affect our ability to draw on these credit facilities nor would they result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any outstanding debt we believe that given our debt ratings our financial management policies our ability to generate cash flow and the noncyclical geographically diversified nature of our businesses we would have access to additional shortterm and longterm capital should the need arise 

  

contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future the table below sets forth bd’s significant contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of september 30 2014 

 

  

  

  

  

 critical accounting policies 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

for certain instruments sold from the biosciences segment we recognize revenue upon installation at a customer’s site as installation of these instruments is considered a significant postdelivery obligation for certain sales arrangements primarily in the us with multiple deliverables revenue and cost of products sold are recognized at the completion of each deliverable shipment installation and training these sales agreements are divided into separate units of accounting and revenue is recognized upon the completion of each deliverable based on its relative selling price the relative selling prices of installation and training are determined based on the prices at which these deliverables would be regularly sold on a standalone basis the relative selling prices of instruments are based on estimated selling prices these estimates represent the quoted sales contract price in each arrangement 

  

bd’s domestic businesses sell products primarily to distributors who resell the products to enduser customers we provide rebates to distributors that sell to enduser customers at prices determined under a contract between bd and the enduser customer provisions for rebates which are based on historical information for all rebates that have not yet been processed as well as sales discounts and returns are accounted for as a reduction of revenues when revenue is recognized 

impairment of assets 

goodwill and inprocess research and development assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with finite lives including core and developed technology and other longlived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units generally represent one level below reporting segments and we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics potential impairment of goodwill is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value our annual goodwill impairment test for 2014 did not result in any impairment charges as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value the previously discussed realignment of bd’s organizational structure from a threesegment to a twosegment structure on october 1 2014 did not change the reporting units bd has identified for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 

we generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with bd’s business plans the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and potentially result in different impacts to bd’s results of operations actual results may differ from management’s estimates 

income taxes 

bd maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 

bd conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions our past audit experience with similar situations and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters bd’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if upon resolution with taxing authorities we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

bd has reviewed its needs in the us for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and with exception for certain countries continues to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the us to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property plant and equipment expenditure needs deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested at september 30 2014 the cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the united states was 49 billion the determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation 

  

contingencies 

we are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including without limitation product liability antitrust and environmental matters as further discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses we establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries a determination of the amount of accruals if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue and when appropriate is developed after consultation with outside counsel the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows 

benefit plans 

we have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations these benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate pension benefit costs also include an assumption for the expected return on plan assets these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

the discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date september 30 specifically for the us pension plan we will use a discount rate of 415 for 2015 which was based on an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve the rate selected is used to measure liabilities as of the measurement date and for calculating the following year’s pension expense the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption although reviewed each year changes less frequently due to the longterm nature of the assumption this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date rather it is used only in the calculation of pension expense to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider many factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results benchmark data expected returns on various plan asset classes as well as current and expected asset allocations we will use a longterm expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 750 for the us pension plan in 2015 we believe our discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our us pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows 

 

  

 sharebased compensation 

compensation cost relating to sharebased payment transactions is recognized in net income using a fair value measurement method all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options are recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense based on their fair values over the vesting period of the awards we determine the fair value of certain sharebased awards using a latticebased binomial option valuation model that incorporates certain assumptions such as the riskfree interest rate 

  

expected volatility expected dividend yield and expected life of the options see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

bd and its representatives may from time to time make certain forwardlooking statements in publicly released materials both written and oral including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission press releases and our reports to shareholders forwardlooking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan” “expect” “believe” “intend” “will” “anticipate” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with among other things discussions of future operations and financial performance as well as our strategy for growth product development regulatory approvals market position and expenditures all statements that address operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to volume growth sales and earnings per share growth cash flows or uses and statements expressing views about future operating results — are forwardlooking statements 

forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations of future events the forwardlooking statements are and will be based on management’s thencurrent views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of their dates investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements furthermore we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information future events and developments or otherwise except as required by applicable law or regulations 

the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements for further discussion of certain of these factors see item 1a risk factors

distribution 

bd’s products are marketed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to endusers by bd and independent sales representatives order backlog is not material to bd’s business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock bd’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the bd medical segment and respiratory and flu diagnostic products in the bd diagnostics segment which relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza 

raw materials 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products bd seeks to ensure continuity of raw material supply by securing multiple options for 

  

sourcing however there are situations where raw materials are only available from one supplier which are referred to as sole sourced the use of sole sourced materials may be due to sourcing of proprietary andor patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product in other cases while a raw material can be sourced from multiple manufacturers only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance cost or other considerations in order to provide alternate sources of raw materials bd must complete a rigorous qualification process which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval if clinical trials are not required this qualification process can take 318 months depending on the criticality of the change when clinical trials are required this process may lengthen the qualification phase for one to three years bd continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and maintains business continuity plans with our suppliers bd’s continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities maintaining contingency stock internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts while bd works closely with its suppliers there may nonetheless be events that cause supply interruption reduction or termination that adversely impacts bd’s ability to manufacture and sell certain products 

research and development 

bd conducts its research and development “rd” activities at its operating units and at bd technologies in research triangle park north carolina the majority of bd’s rd activities are conducted in the united states outside the united states bd’s businesses conduct rd activities in canada china france india and singapore bd also collaborates with certain universities medical centers and other entities on rd programs and retains individual consultants to support its efforts in specialized fields bd spent approximately 494 million 472 million and 470 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended september 30 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively

competition 

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment in addition the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations are creating increased pricing pressures particularly in developing markets some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs 

bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement in support of its core strategy — to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers 

  

thirdparty reimbursement 

most of our customers and healthcare providers typically rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures products and services they provide our devices are subject to worldwide regulations regarding reimbursement developed by government agencies including the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms in the united states the national health service in the united kingdom the joint federal committee in germany the commission d’evaluation des produits et prestations in france the ministry for health labor and welfare in japan the ministry of health and the national development and reform commission in china among many others in addition our devices are also subject to reimbursement policies issued by private insurance companies and managed care organizations the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer’s discretion the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of these thirdparty payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products thus changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products 

while bd is actively engaged in promoting the value propositions of its products for payer provider and patient stakeholders and it employs various efforts and resources to positively impact coverage coding and payment processes in this regard it has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and payment levels for bd products many thirdparty payers are seeking to control the growth of healthcare expenditures and have developed specific payment and delivery mechanisms to support these cost control efforts these mechanisms include payment reductions pay for performance measures qualitybased performance payments restrictive coverage policies bidding and tender mechanics studies to compare the effectiveness of therapies and use of technology assessments these changes have created an increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective and qualitydriven healthcare as government programs including cms and many other national healthcare programs seek to expand healthcare coverage for their citizens they have at the same time sought to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures products or services 

as bd’s product offerings are diverse across many healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment systems therefore individual countries product lines or product classes may be impacted by changes to these systems notably the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” provides for numerous substantive changes to us healthcare payment systems the law focuses on medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs the medicare provisions include valuebased payment programs increased funding of comparative effectiveness research reduced hospital payments for avoidable readmissions and healthcare acquired conditions and infections new programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies that promote care coordination such as accountable care organizations and bundled physician and hospital payments have been established and will continue to be implemented during the next several years that could impact the value and payment for our products see item 1a risk factors for a further discussion 

regulation 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

bd actively maintains fdaiso quality systems that establish standards for its product design manufacturing and distribution processes prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews of bd’s quality systems as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials these regulatory controls as well as any changes in fda policies can 

  

affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

bd also is subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the united states concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws global anticorruption transportation safety and health and customs and exports many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years this appears to be part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the united states 

in addition as part of ppaca the federal government has enacted the sunshine act provisions beginning in 2013 we are required to track and in 2014 publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals many of these requirements are new and uncertain and failure to comply could result in a range of fines penalties andor other sanctions 

bd believes it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable law and the regulations promulgated by the applicable agencies including without limitation environmental laws and regulations and that such compliance has not had and will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or results see item 3 legal proceedings 

employees 

as of september 30 2013 bd had 29979 employees of whom 11908 were employed in the us including puerto rico bd believes that its employee relations are satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors tableend an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows 

global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our operations 

in recent years we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions particularly in the us and western europe further deterioration in the global economic environment may result in decreased demand for our products and services increased competition downward pressure on the prices for our products longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies we anticipate that these industry conditions will continue for the foreseeable future weakening macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers and there can be no assurances that bd will not experience any interruptions in supply in the future we have also experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain countries in western europe and we may experience similar delays in these and other regions experiencing liquidity problems 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

about 58 of our fiscal year 2013 revenues were derived from international operations and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the us in the future the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 7 management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks 

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources and by country may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states or abroad or changes in reimbursement rates by private payers could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using bd products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products for example the center for medicare and medicaid services cms has proposed a series of changes to the way diagnostic tests are reimbursed that would significantly cut reimbursement rates including for some pathology tests that use flow cytometry see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business 

federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” was enacted in march 2010 under the ppaca beginning in 2013 medical device manufacturers such as bd pay a 23 excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices for fiscal 2013 this excise tax which impacted only three quarters of the fiscal year was 40 million we cannot predict with any certainty what other impact the ppaca may have on our business the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures these factors in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursement rates for our products other provisions in the law may significantly change the practice of health care and could adversely affect aspects of our business while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the united states the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of bd’s products remains uncertain 

  

efforts to reduce the us federal deficit could adversely affect our results of operations 

as part of the budget control act passed in august 2011 to extend the federal debt limit and reduce government spending 12 trillion in automatic spending cuts known as sequestration over the next decade have gone into effect beginning in 2013 and will remain in effect in the absence of further legislative action half of the automatic reductions will come from lowering the caps imposed on nondefense discretionary spending and cutting domestic entitlement programs including reductions in payments to medicare providers government research funding has also been reduced as a result of sequestration such reductions in government healthcare spending or research funding could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure further there is ongoing uncertainty regarding the federal budget and federal spending levels including the possible impacts of a failure to increase the “debt ceiling” any us government default on its debt could have broad macroeconomic effects that could among other things raise our borrowing costs any future shutdown of the federal government or failure to enact annual appropriations could also have a material adverse impact on our business 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

the medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has also placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

cost volatility could adversely affect our operations 

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials components freight and energy in particular bd purchases supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results increases in the price of oil can also increase bd’s costs for packaging and transportation new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of certain raw materials and components we may not be able to offset increases in these costs through other cost reductions 

breaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations like many multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future we also store certain information with third parties that could be subject to these types of attacks these attacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being lost or stolen disruption of our operations and other negative consequences such as increased costs for security measures or remediation costs and diversion of management attention recently we became aware that certain of our information systems have been compromised by an external threat our ongoing investigation by an independent thirdparty security firm has not revealed the loss of information that would otherwise result in material interruption of or damage to our information systems or material disruption of our operations while we will continue to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of and detect future cyber incidents cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly there can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a significant impact on our business 

bd’s future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers the development of these products requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our 

  

product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including bd’s ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market approval of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 

we cannot guarantee that any of bd’s strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

as part of our strategy to increase revenue growth we seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 

the medical technology industry is very competitive 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological change in addition we face changing customer preferences and requirements including increased customer demand for more environmentallyfriendly products we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features clinical outcomes price services and other factors we face this competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations has also created pricing pressure particularly in developing markets some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs 

the international operations of bd’s business may subject bd to certain business risks 

the majority of our sales come from our operations outside the united states and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets especially in emerging markets bd’s foreign operations subject bd to certain risks including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above the effects of local economic conditions foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements local product preferences and product requirements difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations differing labor regulations changes in tax laws potential political instability trade barriers weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries trade protection and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders the success of our operations outside the united states depends in part on our ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and sales and distribution networks 

in addition our international operations are governed by the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and similar anticorruption laws global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more enforcement proceedings by us and foreign governmental agencies while we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws our international operations create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments by employees consultants sales agents or distributors any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government scrutiny severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities and negatively affect our reputation 

  

under the us tax code we may also be subject to additional taxation to the extent we repatriate earnings from our foreign operations to the us in the event we require more capital in the united states than is generated by our us operations to fund acquisitions or other activities and elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rate may be higher as a result 

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our bd biosciences segment 

our bd biosciences segment sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and agencies in other countries the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods the availability of governmental research funding may also continue to be adversely affected by the current economic conditions and as described above governmental spending reductions any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect bd’s manufacturing operations and related product sales 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials and components certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment and components are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons bd elects to purchase certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers the supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of reasons including economic conditions as described above while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants weather natural disasters including pandemics terrorism political change failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures equipment malfunction environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products resulting in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers 

bd is subject to lawsuits 

bd is or has been a defendant in a number of lawsuits including purported class action lawsuits for among other things alleged antitrust violations and suits alleging patent infringement and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in item 3 legal proceedings given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s results of operations and cash flows 

bd is subject to extensive regulation 

bd’s operations are global and are affected by various state federal and international healthcare environmental antitrust anticorruption fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws and employment laws violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines 

  

and in some cases exclusion from participation in health care programs such as medicare and medicaid bd is also subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of bd’s products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources and these have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda for supporting data for submissions the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable fda and other regulatory requirements continue to be met 

following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production marketing or sale of our products and result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances closure of manufacturing sites seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation recent changes in enforcement practice by the fda and other agencies have resulted in increased enforcement activity which increases the compliance risk for bd and other companies in our industry 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unapproved use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products 

we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning system 

we are engaged in a project to upgrade our enterprise resource planning “erp” system our erp system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records record transactions provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements the implementation of the new erp system has required and will continue to require the investment of significant financial and human resources in addition we may not be able to successfully complete the implementation of the new erp system without experiencing difficulties any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 

many of bd’s businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property assets these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business bd can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position in addition competitors may claim that bd products infringe upon their intellectual property and resolving any intellectual property claim can be costly and timeconsuming the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

  

natural disasters war and other events could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

natural disasters including pandemics war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts and actions taken by the united states and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and in areas outside of the united states in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers 

we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 

our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense bd’s ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected

 item 3 legal proceedings 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally bd is not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which bd is a party in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles bd establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries in view of the uncertainties discussed below bd could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows 

bd was named as a defendant in five purported class action suits brought on behalf of distributors and other entities that purchase bd’s products the “distributor plaintiffs” alleging that bd violated federal antitrust laws resulting in the charging of higher prices for bd’s products to the plaintiffs and other purported class members these actions were consolidated under the caption “in re hypodermic products antitrust litigation” pursuant to a settlement agreement bd entered into with the distributor plaintiffs in these actions on april 27 2009 and following approval by the district court on a preliminarily basis in november 2012 and on a final basis in april 2013 bd has paid 45 million in exchange for a release by all potential class members of the direct purchaser claims under federal antitrust laws related to the products and acts enumerated in the complaint and a dismissal of the case with prejudice insofar as it relates to direct purchaser claims 

bd is also named as a defendant in the following purported class action suits brought on behalf of indirect purchasers of bd’s products such as hospitals and retailers the “hospital plaintiffs” alleging that bd violated federal and state antitrust laws resulting in the charging of higher prices for bd’s products to the plaintiffs and other purported class members 

 

 the plaintiffs in each of the above antitrust class action lawsuits seek monetary damages these antitrust class action lawsuits have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in a multidistrict litigation in federal court in new jersey 

on july 30 2013 bd entered into an agreement with the hospital plaintiffs to settle their claims in these actions which agreement has been preliminarily approved and is subject to final approval by the court following notice to potential class members the settlement agreement provides for bd to pay 22 million into a fund in exchange for a release by all potential class members of the indirect purchaser claims related to the products and acts enumerated in the complaint and a dismissal of the case with prejudice the release will not cover potential class members that opt out of the settlement bd currently cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible losses with respect to these class action matters beyond the 22 million settlement 

  

in june 2007 retractable technologies inc “rti” filed a complaint against bd under the caption retractable technologies inc vs becton dickinson and company civil action no 207cv250 us district court eastern district of texas rti alleges that the bd integra™ syringes infringe patents licensed exclusively to rti in its complaint rti also alleges that bd engaged in false advertising with respect to certain of bd’s safetyengineered products in violation of the lanham act acted to exclude rti from various product markets and to maintain its market share through among other things exclusionary contracts in violation of state and federal antitrust laws and engaged in unfair competition in january 2008 the court severed the patent and nonpatent claims into separate cases and stayed the nonpatent claims during the pendency of the patent claims at the trial court level rti seeks money damages and injunctive relief on april 1 2008 rti filed a complaint against bd under the caption retractable technologies inc and thomas j shaw v becton dickinson and company civil action no208cv141 us district court eastern district of texas rti alleges that the bd integra™ syringes infringe another patent licensed exclusively to rti rti seeks money damages and injunctive relief on august 29 2008 the court ordered the consolidation of the patent cases on november 9 2009 at a trial of these consolidated cases the jury rendered a verdict in favor of rti on all but one of its infringement claims but did not find any willful infringement and awarded rti 5 million in damages on may 19 2010 the court granted rti’s motion for a permanent injunction against the continued sale by bd of its bd integra™ products in their current form but stayed the injunction for the duration of bd’s appeal at the same time the court lifted a stay of rti’s nonpatent claims on july 8 2011 the court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed the district court judgment that bd’s 3ml bd integra™ products infringed the asserted rti patents and affirmed the district court judgment of infringement against bd’s discontinued 1ml bd integra™ products on october 31 2011 the federal circuit court of appeals denied rti’s request for an en banc rehearing in january 2013 rti’s petition for review with the us supreme court was denied bd’s motion for further proceedings on damages was denied by the district court on the grounds that the court did not have authority to modify the 5 million damage award bd has appealed this ruling to the federal circuit court of appeals 

on september 19 2013 a jury returned a verdict against bd with respect to certain of rti’s nonpatent claims the verdict was unfavorable to bd with respect to rti’s lanham act claim and claim for attempted monopolization based on deception in the safety syringe market the jury awarded rti 1135 million for its attempted monopolization claim which will be trebled and attorneys’ fees added to under the antitrust statute the court will determine whether to award equitable relief under the lanham act including disgorgement the jury’s verdict rejected rti’s monopolization claims in the markets for safety syringes conventional syringes and safety iv catheters its attempted monopolization claims in the markets for conventional syringes and safety iv catheters and its claims for contractual restraint of trade and exclusive dealing in the markets for safety syringes conventional syringes and safety iv catheters in connection with the verdict bd recorded a pretax charge of approximately 341 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 bd plans to appeal the jury’s verdict 

on november 4 2013 the secretariat of foreign trade secex of the federal republic of brazil initiated an administrative antidumping investigation of imports of vacuum plastic tubes for blood collection into brazil from the united states of america the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland the federal republic of germany and the people’s republic of china during the period from january 2012 through december 2012 bd through its united states and international subsidiaries exports vacuum plastic tubes for blood collection into brazil and is cooperating with the investigation the investigation is expected to be completed by november 2014 but could extend longer during the course of the investigation on a provisional basis and upon completion of the investigation on a final basis the secex will issue a decision on whether grounds exist to apply antidumping measures including without limitation the imposition of duties on such vacuum plastic tubes imported into brazil once applied antidumping measures will last for as long as the measures are deemed necessary which in most cases is for five years bd does not expect that the outcome of the investigation will materially affect results of operations 

bd believes that it has meritorious defenses to each of the abovementioned suits pending against bd and is engaged in a vigorous defense of each of these matters 

bd is also involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 

  

on october 19 2009 genprobe incorporated “genprobe” filed a patent infringement action against bd in the us district court for the southern district of california the complaint alleges that the bd viper™ and bd viper™ xtr™ systems and bd probetec™ specimen collection products infringe certain us patents of genprobe on march 23 2010 genprobe filed a complaint also in the us district court for the southern district of california alleging that the bd max™ instrument infringes genprobe patents the patents alleged to be infringed are a subset of the genprobe patents asserted against bd in the october 2009 suit on june 8 2010 the court consolidated these cases on december 1 2012 bd entered into a settlement agreement with genprobe under which bd is granted a license to make use and sell products accused of infringing genprobe patents in the action the payments that bd made to genprobe under the settlement which include a settlement payment a licensing fee and ongoing royalties are not material to bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows following the settlement the case was dismissed with prejudice

company overview 

description of the company and business segments 

becton dickinson and company “bd” is a global medical technology company engaged principally in the development manufacture and sale of medical devices instrument systems and reagents used by healthcare institutions life science researchers clinical laboratories the pharmaceutical industry and the general public our business consists of three worldwide business segments — bd medical “medical” bd diagnostics “diagnostics” and bd biosciences “biosciences” our products are marketed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to endusers by bd and independent sales representatives 

strategic objectives 

bd remains focused on delivering sustainable growth and shareholder value while making appropriate investments for the future bd management operates the business consistent with the following core strategies 

 

  

  

  

  

 our strategy focuses on four specific areas within healthcare and life sciences 

 

  

  

  

 we continue to strive to improve the efficiency of our capital structure and follow these guiding principles 

 

  

  

 in assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as bd’s financial condition and operating performance management generally reviews quarterly forecast data monthly actual results segment sales and other similar information we also consider trends related to certain key financial data including gross profit margin selling and administrative expense investment in research and development return on invested capital and cash flows 

summary of financial results 

worldwide revenues in 2013 of 81 billion increased 45 from the prior year and reflected estimated volume increases of 55 including growth from acquisitions of 08 which were partially offset by estimated unfavorable foreign exchange translation of 09 and by estimated unfavorable price impacts including product mix of 01 solid growth from our medical and diagnostics segments was primarily driven by new product sales growth from acquisitions sales of safetyengineered products and geographic expansion biosciences 

  

revenue growth was primarily driven by instrument and reagent sales in emerging markets partially offset by declines in western europe revenues in the united states in 2013 of 34 billion increased 20 over the prior year and reflected growth from all segments ongoing weaker demand in the diagnostics segment’s women’s health and cancer platform continued to unfavorably impact us revenue growth in 2013 international revenues in 2013 of 47 billion increased 63 which reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 17 international revenues for 2013 reflected growth from all segments including growth attributable to emerging markets as well as strong sales of safetyengineered products sales in the united states of safetyengineered devices grew 29 to 118 billion in 2013 from 115 billion in 2012 international sales of safetyengineered devices grew 10 to 917 million in 2013 compared with 834 million in 2012 which included an estimated 19 negative impact due to unfavorable foreign currency translation international safetyengineered device revenue growth continues to be driven by strong sales in the medical segment with the largest growth in emerging markets 

we continue to invest in research and development spending geographic expansion and new product promotions to drive further revenue and profit growth our ability to sustain our longterm growth will depend on a number of factors including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion develop innovative new products and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness the healthcare industry continues to face a challenging economic environment the current economic conditions and other circumstances have resulted in pricing pressures for some of our products continued uncertainty in the research spending environment could adversely impact our biosciences segment in other areas of our us business healthcare utilization is stable but constrained additionally we have experienced constrained healthcare utilization in europe due to continued macroeconomic challenges in that region although we currently view the environment as stable 

in addition to the economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere numerous other factors can affect our ability to achieve our goals including without limitation increased competition and healthcare reform initiatives for example the us patient protection affordable care act contains the medical device excise tax that effective january 1 2013 imposes a 23 tax on certain us sales of medical devices the impact of this tax on our 2013 results is further discussed below 

our financial position remains strong with cash flows from operating activities totaling 17 billion in 2013 at september 30 2013 we had 26 billion in cash and equivalents and shortterm investments cash outflows relating to acquisitions primarily represented the purchase of safety syringes inc “safety syringes” a privately held californiabased company that specializes in the development of antineedlestick devices for prefilled syringes for 124 million net of cash acquired cash flows relating to acquisitions also included the purchase of cato software solutions “cato” a privately held austriabased manufacturer of a suite of comprehensive medication safety software solutions for 14 million net of cash acquired net cash inflows from divestitures of 736 million represented the sale of biosciences’ discovery labware unit excluding its advanced bioprocessing platform also we continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends during 2013 we repurchased 450 million of our common stock and paid cash dividends of 386 million 

we face currency exposure each reporting period that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period we evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a foreign currencyneutral basis which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we calculate foreign currencyneutral percentages by converting our currentperiod local currency financial results using the priorperiod foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our currentperiod reported results from time to time we may purchase forward contracts and options to partially protect against adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on our derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes for further discussion refer to note 12 to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

results of continuing operations 

comparisons of income from continuing operations between 2013 and 2012 are affected by the following items that are reflected in our financial results 

 

  

  

  

  

 medical segment 

medical revenue in 2013 of 43 billion increased 53 over 2012 which reflected an estimated unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 07 

the following is a summary of medical revenues by organizational unit 

 

 medical segment revenue growth was driven by solid growth in all units medical surgical systems revenue growth was largely attributable to sales in emerging markets and strong international sales of safetyengineered products revenue growth in the diabetes care unit reflected strong sales of pen needles including the bd ultrafine ™ nano and bd pentapoint ™ products as well as the bd autoshield ™ duo pen needle revenue growth in the pharmaceutical systems unit primarily benefitted from the acquisition of safety syringes in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 global sales of safetyengineered products were 10 billion compared with 966 million in the prior year and included an estimated 8 million unfavorable impact due to foreign currency translation 

  

medical operating income in 2013 was 123 billion or 286 of medical revenues compared with 116 billion or 284 of segment revenues in 2012 gross profit margin was higher in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to lower manufacturing costs resulting from project reloco a global crossfunctional business initiative to drive sustained lowcost capability primarily benefitting medical surgical systems as well as lower raw material costs partially offset by manufacturing startup costs gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by a change in useful lives of certain machinery and equipment assets effective january 1 2012 see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percent of medical revenues in 2013 increased to 184 of revenues from 177 in 2012 aggregate expenses in 2013 reflected the medical device excise tax previously discussed increased spending for expansion in emerging markets and higher expenses associated with the safety syringes and cato acquisitions these increases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation research and development expenses in 2013 increased 17 million or 11 from 2012 reflecting ongoing investment in new products and platforms 

diagnostics segment 

diagnostics revenues in 2013 of 26 billion increased 43 over 2012 which reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 09  

the following is a summary of diagnostics revenues by organizational unit 

 

 diagnostics segment revenue growth was driven by solid growth in both units particularly in emerging markets revenue growth in the preanalytical systems unit was driven by sales of safetyengineered products sales of safetyengineered products grew 1 in the united states driven by bd vacutainer tm push button blood collection set sales and 7 internationally which included an estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 2 the diagnostic systems unit experienced growth in worldwide sales of its automated diagnostic platforms including bd max tm and bd affirm tm systems along with solid growth of its bd bactec tm blood culture and tb systems and the bd phoenix tm idast platform diagnostics revenues in 2013 also reflected new product launches and a favorable comparison to the prior year due to a stronger flu season in 2013 as well as from the timing of the kiestra acquisition diagnostics segment revenue growth in the us was unfavorably impacted by continued weaker demand in the women’s health and cancer platform due to guidelines providing for increased pap smear testing intervals 

diagnostics operating income in 2013 was 638 million or 241 of diagnostics revenues compared with 653 million or 257 of revenues in 2012 gross profit margin in the diagnostics segment was down as compared to 2012 and reflected legal settlement costs amortization expense related to the jaguar plus platform an inprocess rd project acquired with the handylab acquisition and completed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the unfavorable impact of decreased sales of products which have higher gross margins see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of diagnostics revenues increased by 120 basis points in 2013 to 228 aggregate expenses in 2013 reflected an increase in investments in emerging markets and higher expenses associated with the kiestra acquisition that occurred in the second quarter of 2012 these increases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation research and development expense increased 1 million or 1 from 2012 rd spending in 2013 reflected our continued investment in the development of new products and platforms including the bd max ™ and new bd viper ™ platforms and test menus 

  

biosciences segment 

biosciences revenues of 11 billion in 2013 increased 20 over 2012 and reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 16 biosciences revenue growth was primarily driven by instrument and reagent sales in emerging markets partially offset by declines in western europe 

biosciences operating income in 2013 was 269 million or 244 of biosciences revenues compared with 262 million or 242 in 2012 the segment’s operating income in 2013 reflected a slightly higher gross profit margin as compared to 2012 primarily due to the favorable impact of increased sales of products which have higher gross margins partially offset by lower pricing on certain product lines see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of biosciences revenues was 250 in 2013 as compared with 244 in 2012 aggregate expenses reflected continued investments in emerging markets partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation research and development spending increased 6 million or 6 from 2012 and reflected spending on new products and platforms including next generation cell sorters and analyzers 

geographic revenues 

revenues in the united states in 2013 of 34 billion increased 20 over 2012 and reflected growth in all segments us revenue growth in the medical segment was primarily driven by pharmaceutical systems which was aided by the acquisition of safety syringes in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 diagnostics segment revenue growth in the united states was unfavorably impacted by a decline in women’s health and cancer platform sales due to guidelines providing for increased pap smear testing intervals biosciences revenue growth in the united states reflected slight growth in instrument placements we remain cautious about the us environment for this segment given the continued uncertainty around us government research funding due to the impact of automatic us government spending cuts or sequestration that went into effect in march 2013 

international revenues in 2013 of 47 billion increased 63 over 2012 which reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 17 international revenues in 2013 reflected continued strength in emerging market revenues and strong sales of safetyengineered products for the medical and diagnostics segments growth in the diagnostics segment also benefitted from the kiestra acquisition international biosciences revenue growth was driven by growth in emerging markets partially offset by weaker sales in western europe due to austerity measures as well as by lower levels of research funding in japan 

gross profit margin 

gross profit margin was 518 in 2013 compared with 513 in 2012 the increase primarily reflected operating performance gross profit margin was favorably impacted by approximately 80 basis points primarily due to lower manufacturing costs from continuous improvement projects such as project reloco and lower raw material costs gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by approximately 20 basis points due to a change in useful lives of certain machinery and equipment assets effective january 1 2012 largely within the medical segment gross profit margin was adversely affected by approximately 50 basis points primarily due to amortization of intangibles associated with recent acquisitions lower pricing on certain product lines and manufacturing startup costs 

operating expenses 

selling and administrative expense in 2013 was 24 billion or 301 of revenues compared with 19 billion or 250 of revenues in 2012 as discussed earlier selling and administrative expense in 2013 included charges of 363 million relating to litigation matters and 40 million related to the medical device excise tax aggregate expenses for 2013 reflected an increase in core spending of 118 million which included 61 million relating to expansion of our business in emerging markets as well as higher expenses resulting from recent acquisitions these increases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation of 19 million and a decrease in deferred compensation expense of 3 million this change in the deferred compensation liability is further discussed below 

  

research and development expense in 2013 was 494 million or 61 of revenues compared with 472 million or 61 of revenues in 2012 and reflected increased investment in new products and platforms in all three segments 

nonoperating expense and income 

interest expense in 2013 was 138 million compared with 135 million in 2012 the increase in interest expense in 2013 primarily reflected higher average levels of longterm fixedrate debt interest income was 40 million in 2013 compared with 50 million in 2012 the decrease in interest income in 2013 compared with 2012 reflected the impact of lower interest rates on investments outside the us and lower investment gains on assets related to our deferred compensation plan the offsetting movements in the deferred compensation plan liability were recorded in selling and administrative expense 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate in 2013 of 202 was lower compared with the 2012 rate of 246 the impact of the 2013 charges relating to litigation matters and a pension settlement reduced the effective tax rate in 2013 by 430 basis points the income tax rate in 2013 also reflected the favorable impact from various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions and the reinstatement of the us research and development tax credit partially offset by a lower benefit on foreign earnings the income tax rate in 2012 which was reduced by 20 basis points due to the 2012 pension settlement charge reflected the favorable impact of various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions 

income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2013 were 929 million and 467 respectively the aftertax charges relating to the litigation matters decreased income from continuing operations in 2013 by 225 million or 113 per share the aftertax charge related to pension settlement decreased income from continuing operations in 2013 by 4 million or 002 per share earnings in 2013 also reflected the unfavorable impact of the medical device excise tax of 013 per share as well as an estimated net unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of 006 per share income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2012 were 11 billion and 530 respectively the aftertax charge related to pension settlements decreased income from continuing operations in 2012 by 13 million or 006 per share earnings in 2012 also reflected an estimated overall net unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of 021 per share 

discontinued operations 

in october 2012 we sold the biosciences’ discovery labware unit excluding its advanced bioprocessing platform and received gross proceeds of approximately 740 million and recognized a pretax gain on sale of approximately 577 million for further discussion see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

financial instrument market risk 

we selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations the counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign exchange risk 

bd and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout europe asia pacific canada japan and latin america we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency these payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions we hedge substantially all such exposures primarily through the use of forward contracts we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations including sales to the us dollar at exchange 

  

rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period from time to time we may purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future earnings resulting from adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions we did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows in fiscal year 2013 

derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value for foreign currency derivatives market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities with respect to the derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2013 a 10 appreciation of the us dollar over a oneyear period would decrease pretax earnings by 31 million while a 10 depreciation of the us dollar would increase pretax earnings by 31 million comparatively considering our derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2012 a 10 appreciation of the us dollar over a oneyear period would have decreased pretax earnings by 8 million while a 10 depreciation of the us dollar would have increased pretax earnings by 8 million these calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments 

interest rate risk 

our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates our debt and interestbearing investments at september 30 2013 are substantially all us dollardenominated therefore transaction and translation exposure relating to such instruments is minimal when managing interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments we may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interestbearing investments in tandem since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure for interest rate derivative instruments fair values are provided by the financial institutions that are counterparties to these arrangements market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities a change in interest rates on shortterm debt and interestbearing investments impacts our earnings and cash flow but not the fair value of these instruments because of their limited duration a change in interest rates on longterm debt is assumed to impact the fair value of the debt but not our earnings or cash flow because the interest on such obligations is fixed based on our overall interest rate exposure at september 30 2013 and 2012 a change of 10 in interest rates would not have a material effect on our earnings or cash flows over a oneyear period an increase of 10 in interest rates would decrease the aggregate fair value of our longterm debt and related fair value hedges at september 30 2013 and 2012 by approximately 105 million and 109 million respectively a 10 decrease in interest rates would increase the aggregate fair value of these same financial instruments at september 30 2013 and 2012 by approximately 111 million and 115 million respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash flows from continuing operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2013 was 172 billion compared with 169 billion in 2012 and was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations as adjusted for depreciation and amortization the net change in working capital was primarily driven by an increase in accrued payables reflecting the charge from the rti litigation verdict partially offset by higher inventory levels and prepaid expenses net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2013 was reduced by changes in the pension obligation resulting primarily from discretionary cash contributions of 132 million an additional discretionary contribution of 40 million was made to the us pension plan in october 2013 

  

net cash flows from continuing investing activities 

capital expenditures 

our investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities and support our strategy of geographic expansion with select investments in growing markets capital expenditures were 522 million in 2013 compared with 487 million in 2012 capital spending for the medical diagnostics and biosciences segments in 2013 was 354 million 142 million and 16 million respectively and related primarily to manufacturing capacity expansions 

acquisitions of businesses 

cash outflows relating to acquisitions of 136 million in 2013 included 124 million relating to the safety syringes acquisition and 14 million associated with the cato acquisition in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2013 respectively cash outflows relating to acquisitions of 103 million in 2012 were comprised of 51 million relating to the kiestra acquisition and 52 million associated with the acquisition of sirigen for further discussion refer to note 9 to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

net cash flows from continuing financing activities 

payments of obligations and debt issuances 

net cash used for financing activities in 2013 reflected the repayment of 200 million of 455 notes due on april 15 2013 in 2012 net cash provided by financing activities included the proceeds from 500 million of 5year 175 notes and 1 billion of 10year 3125 notes issued on november 3 2011 shortterm debt decreased to 52 of total debt at the end of 2013 from 97 at the end of 2012 due to the repayment of 455 notes referred to above our weighted average cost of total debt at the end of 2013 was 38 up from 37 at the end of 2012 as of september 30 2013 total debt of 40 billion represented 431 of total capital shareholders’ equity net noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities and debt compared with 497 at september 30 2012 

repurchase of common stock 

we repurchased approximately 55 million shares of our common stock for 450 million in 2013 and 199 million shares for 15 billion in 2012 in september 2013 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 10 million of our common shares when combined with the remaining shares under the board of directors’ july 2011 repurchase authorization a total of approximately 127 million common shares remain available for purchase at september 30 2013 we plan on share repurchases of approximately 450 million in 2014 subject to market conditions 

cash and shortterm investments 

at september 30 2013 total worldwide cash and shortterm investments were 26 billion of which 14 billion was held in jurisdictions outside of the united states we regularly review the amount of cash and shortterm investments held outside the united states and currently intend to use most of such amounts to fund our international operations and their growth initiatives however if these amounts were moved out of these jurisdictions or repatriated to the united states there could be tax consequences 

government receivables 

accounts receivable balances include sales to governmentowned or governmentsupported healthcare facilities in several countries some of which are subject to delays payment may be dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries’ national economies deteriorated credit and economic conditions in parts of western europe particularly in italy and spain may continue to increase the average length of time it takes us to collect our accounts receivable in certain regions within these countries at september 30 2013 and 2012 outstanding governmental receivable balances net of reserves in italy were 73 million and 71 million respectively and in spain were 61 million and 43 million respectively 

  

we continually evaluate all governmental receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices we believe the current reserves related to all governmental receivables are adequate and that this concentration of credit risk will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity 

credit facilities 

we have in place a commercial paper borrowing program that is available to meet our shortterm financing needs including working capital requirements borrowings outstanding under this program were 200 million at september 30 2013 we have available a 1 billion syndicated credit facility with an expiration date of may 2017 this credit facility under which there were no borrowings outstanding at september 30 2013 provides backup support for our commercial paper program and can also be used for other general corporate purposes it includes a provision that enables bd subject to additional commitments made by the lenders to access up to an additional 500 million in financing through the facility for a maximum aggregate commitment of 15 billion the credit facility includes a single financial covenant that requires bd to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio ratio of earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 5to1 for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters on the last eight measurement dates this ratio has ranged from 131to1 to 167to1 in addition we have informal lines of credit outside the united states 

access to capital and credit ratings 

our ability to generate cash flow from operations issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms could be adversely affected in the event there was a material decline in the demand for our products deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions 

bd’s credit ratings at september 30 2013 were as follows 

 

 while any deterioration in our credit ratings would increase the costs associated with maintaining and borrowing under our existing credit arrangements such a downgrade would not affect our ability to draw on these credit facilities nor would it result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any outstanding debt we believe that given our debt ratings our conservative financial management policies our ability to generate cash flow and the noncyclical geographically diversified nature of our businesses we would have access to additional shortterm and longterm capital should the need arise 

contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future the table below sets forth bd’s significant contractual obligations and related scheduled payments 

 

   

 

  

  

  

 2012 compared with 2011 

comparisons of income from continuing operations between 2012 and 2011 are affected by the following items that are reflected in our financial results 

 

  

 medical segment 

medical revenues in 2012 of 41 billion increased 21 over 2011 which reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 30 

the following is a summary of medical revenues by organizational unit 

 

 medical segment revenue growth on a foreign currencyneutral basis reflected solid growth in all units medical surgical systems revenue reflected solid growth of international safetyengineered product sales and growth from sales of the bd phaseal™ product resulting from the carmel pharma ab “carmel” acquisition that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011 diabetes care revenue growth reflected continued strong sales of pen needles including sales of the bd ultrafine™ nano pharmaceutical systems revenue reflected the continued strong demand from companies producing biotech drugs and certain heparin products global sales of safetyengineered products were 966 million compared with 885 million in 2011 and included an estimated 14 million unfavorable impact due to foreign currency translation 

medical operating income in 2012 was 12 billion or 284 of medical revenues as compared with 12 billion or 295 of revenues in 2011 gross profit margin was lower in the current year than in 2011 primarily due to amortization of intangibles associated with the carmel acquisition unfavorable pricing impacts on certain product lines and the unfavorable impact of decreased sales of products which have higher gross margins these unfavorable impacts on gross profit margin were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation and lower manufacturing costs resulting from project reloco see further discussion on gross profit margin below 

  

selling and administrative expense as a percentage of medical revenues in 2012 increased to 177 of revenues from 175 of revenues in 2011 primarily due to increased spending for expansion in emerging markets and higher expenses resulting from the carmel acquisition as compared with the prior year’s period partially offset by continued spending controls and favorable foreign currency translation research and development expenses in 2012 increased 11 million or 8 over 2011 and reflected continued investment in the development of new products and platforms including new diabetes care and closed system transfer devices 

diagnostics segment 

diagnostics revenues in 2012 of 25 billion increased 23 over 2011 which reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 22  

the following is a summary of diagnostics revenues by organizational unit 

 

 revenue growth in the preanalytical systems unit on a foreign currencyneutral basis was driven by sales of safetyengineered products sales of safetyengineered products grew 2 in the united states driven by bd vacutainer tm push button blood collection set sales and 4 internationally which included an estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 5 the diagnostic systems unit experienced growth in worldwide sales of its automated diagnostic platforms including the molecular bd probetec tm  bd viper tm and bd affirm tm systems along with solid growth of its bd bactec tm blood culture and tb systems and the bd phoenix tm idast platform and its surepath products diagnostics revenues in 2012 also reflected a favorable comparison to 2011 due to new product launches and the kiestra acquisition 

diagnostics operating income in 2012 was 653 million or 257 of diagnostics revenues compared with 636 million or 257 of revenues in 2011 gross profit margin in the diagnostics segment was down as compared to 2011 and reflected unfavorable foreign currency translation higher raw material costs and the unfavorable impact of decreased sales of products which have higher gross margins see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of diagnostics revenues increased by 10 basis points in 2012 to 216 primarily due to investments in emerging markets partially offset by continued spending controls and favorable foreign currency translation research and development expense decreased 9 million or 5 from 2011 reflecting a program termination in 2011 rd spending in 2012 reflected our continued investment in the development of new products and platforms including the bd max ™ and new bd viper ™ platforms and test menus 

biosciences segment 

biosciences revenues which include the cell analysis unit and the advanced bioprocessing platform of 11 billion in 2012 decreased 15 from 2011 and reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 22 biosciences revenue growth on a foreign currencyneutral basis was primarily driven by instrument and reagent sales in emerging markets partially offset by declines in the us due to constrained research spending 

biosciences operating income in 2012 was 262 million or 242 of biosciences revenues compared with 278 million or 254 in 2011 the segment’s operating income in 2012 reflected a lower gross profit margin than 2011 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and amortization of capitalized software as well as intangibles associated with the 2011 acquisition of accuri cytometers inc “accuri” the segment’s gross profit margin was also unfavorably impacted by increases in certain raw material costs see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of 

  

biosciences revenues was 244 in 2012 as compared with 245 in 2011 and reflected continued spending controls partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation research and development spending was relatively flat to 2011 and reflects spending on new products and platforms including next generation cell sorters and analyzers 

geographic revenues 

revenues in the united states in 2012 of 33 billion increased 1 growth in us medical revenues reflected strong sales of pharmaceutical systems and diabetes care products which were partially offset by pricing pressures for certain medical surgical systems products diagnostic systems revenue growth in the us was unfavorably affected by an increasingly competitive market for microbiology products and weak sales from our geneohm™ healthcareassociated infections “hai” platform also due to a challenging competitive environment biosciences revenue in the us declined in 2012 compared with 2011 due to reduced research funding as we continue to experience constrained demand for highend instruments due to continued funding concerns in the pharmaceutical and biotech research markets as well as in the academic markets 

international revenues in 2012 of 44 billion increased 2 which reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 5 international revenues for 2012 reflected growth from all segments including growth attributable to emerging markets as well as strong sales of safetyengineered products 

gross profit margin 

gross profit margin was 513 in 2012 compared with 522 in 2011 the decrease in gross profit margin reflected the estimated net unfavorable impact of 70 basis points relating to operating performance an estimated 10 basis points relating to unfavorable foreign currency translation and an estimated 10 basis points relating to pension settlements operating performance was adversely affected by an estimated 50 basis points due to the impact of decreased sales of products which have higher gross margins operating performance also reflected the estimated impacts of 50 basis points due to unfavorable pricing impacts on certain product lines as well as 20 basis points due to increases in certain raw material costs operating performance was also adversely impacted by approximately 10 basis points due to amortization of intangibles associated with recent acquisitions approximately 20 basis points due to biosciences software amortization and approximately 30 basis points due to other unfavorable onetime impacts the unfavorable impacts on operating performance for the current year were partially offset by an estimated 80 basis points due to lower manufacturing costs from continuous improvement projects such as project reloco and lower pension costs operating performance was also favorably impacted by approximately 30 basis points due to a change in useful lives of certain machinery and equipment assets effective january 1 2012

selling and administrative expense in 2012 was 19 billion or 25 of revenues compared with 18 billion or 24 of revenues in 2011 aggregate expenses for 2012 reflected an increase in core spending of 105 million primarily relating to expansion of our business in emerging markets transactions costs relating to the kiestra acquisition and higher expenses resulting from the carmel and kiestra acquisitions aggregate expenses for 2012 also included increased spending of 23 million related to our global enterprise resource planning initiative to update our business information systems and 8 million related to pension settlements additionally aggregate expenses in 2012 included a 16 million increase in the deferred compensation plan liability as further discussed below these increases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation of 41 million and lower pension expense of 11 million 

research and development expense in 2012 was 472 million or 61 of revenues compared with 470 million or 62 of revenues in 2011 the increase in rd expenditures includes spending for new products and platforms in each of our segments as previously discussed rd expense in 2012 also included 2 million associated with pension settlements rd expense in 2011 included a noncash impairment charge of 9 million resulting from the discontinuance of a research program within the diagnostic systems unit 

  

nonoperating expense and income 

interest expense in 2012 was 135 million compared with 84 million in 2011 the increase reflected higher levels of longterm fixedrate debt partially offset by lower average interest rates on this debt as well as a reduction in the amount of capitalized interest the reduction in capitalized interest was attributable to a lower average interest rate on the overall debt portfolio interest income was 50 million in 2012 compared with 43 million in 2011 the increase was largely the result of investment gains on assets related to our deferred compensation plan offset partially by the impact of lower interest rates and lower investment levels in certain nonus locations the offsetting movements in the deferred compensation plan liability were recorded in selling and administrative expenses 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate in 2012 of 246 was lower compared with the 2011 rate of 258 the 2012 rate reflected the favorable impact of various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions while 2011 reflected the favorable impact due to the timing of certain tax benefits resulting from the retroactive extension of the us research tax credit and a european restructuring transaction 

income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2012 were 11 billion and 530 respectively the aftertax charge related to pension settlements decreased income from continuing operations in 2012 by 13 million or 006 per share earnings in 2012 also reflected an estimated overall net unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of 021 per share income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 were 12 billion and 531 respectively the aftertax charge related to the discontinuance of a research program decreased income from continuing operations in 2011 by 6 million or 003 per share 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash flows from continuing operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2012 was 17 billion compared with 16 billion in 2011 the change in operating assets and liabilities in 2012 resulted in a net use of cash and primarily reflected higher levels of inventory and accounts receivables substantially offset by lower levels of prepaid expenses net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2012 was reduced by changes in the pension obligation resulting primarily from a discretionary cash contribution of 100 million 

net cash flows from continuing investing activities 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were 487 million in 2012 compared with 509 million in 2011 capital spending for the medical diagnostics and biosciences segments in 2012 was 363 million 101 million and 14 million respectively and related primarily to manufacturing capacity expansions 

acquisitions of businesses 

cash outflows relating to acquisitions of 103 million in 2012 were comprised of 51 million relating to the kiestra acquisition and 52 million associated with the acquisition of sirigen acquisitions of businesses of 492 million in 2011 were comprised of 287 million associated with carmel and 205 million relating to accuri for further discussion refer to note 9 to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

net cash flows from continuing financing activities 

debt issuances and payments of obligations 

on november 3 2011 we issued 500 million of 5year 175 notes and 1 billion of 10year 3125 notes shortterm debt increased to 97 of total debt at the end of 2012 from 86 at the end of 2011 floating rate debt was 97 of total debt at the end of 2012 and 16 at the end of 2011 our weighted average cost of total debt at the end of 2012 was 37 down from 49 at the end of 2011 as of september 30 2012 total debt represented 497 of total capital shareholders’ equity net noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities and debt compared with 358 at september 30 2011 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue from product sales is typically recognized when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered product price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

for certain instruments sold from the biosciences segment we recognize revenue upon installation at a customer’s site as installation of these instruments is considered a significant postdelivery obligation for certain sales arrangements primarily in the us with multiple deliverables revenue and cost of products sold are recognized at the completion of each deliverable shipment installation and training these sales agreements are divided into separate units of accounting and revenue is recognized upon the completion of each deliverable based on its relative selling price the relative selling prices of installation and training are determined based on the prices at which these deliverables would be regularly sold on a standalone basis the relative selling prices of instruments are based on estimated selling prices these estimates represent the quoted sales contract price in each arrangement 

bd’s domestic businesses sell products primarily to distributors who resell the products to enduser customers we provide rebates to distributors that sell to enduser customers at prices determined under a contract between bd and the enduser customer provisions for rebates which are based on historical information for all rebates that have not yet been processed as well as sales discounts and returns are accounted for as a reduction of revenues when revenue is recognized 

impairment of assets 

goodwill and inprocess research and development assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with finite lives including core and developed technology and other longlived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units generally represent one level below reporting segments and we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar 

  

economic characteristics potential impairment of goodwill is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value our annual goodwill impairment test for 2013 did not result in any impairment charges as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

we generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with bd’s business plans the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and potentially result in different impacts to bd’s results of operations actual results may differ from management’s estimates 

income taxes 

bd maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 

bd conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions our past audit experience with similar situations and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters bd’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if upon resolution with taxing authorities we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

bd has reviewed its needs in the us for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and with exception for certain countries continues to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the us to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property plant and equipment expenditure needs deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested at september 30 2013 the cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the united states was 44 billion the determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation 

contingencies 

we are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including without limitation product liability antitrust and environmental matters as further discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses we establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries a determination of the amount of accruals if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue and when appropriate is developed after consultation with outside counsel the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows 

  

benefit plans 

we have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations these benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate pension benefit costs also include an assumption for the expected return on plan assets these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

the discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date september 30 specifically for the us pension plan we will use a discount rate of 495 for 2014 which was based on an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve the rate selected is used to measure liabilities as of the measurement date and for calculating the following year’s pension expense the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption although reviewed each year changes less frequently due to the longterm nature of the assumption this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date rather it is used only in the calculation of pension expense to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider many factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results benchmark data expected returns on various plan asset classes as well as current and expected asset allocations we will use a longterm expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 775 for the us pension plan in 2014 we believe our discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our us pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows 

 

  

 sharebased compensation 

compensation cost relating to sharebased payment transactions is recognized in net income using a fair value measurement method all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options are recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense based on their fair values over the vesting period of the awards we determine the fair value of certain sharebased awards using a latticebased binomial option valuation model that incorporates certain assumptions such as the riskfree interest rate expected volatility expected dividend yield and expected life of the options see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

bd and its representatives may from time to time make certain forwardlooking statements in publicly released materials both written and oral including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission press releases and our reports to shareholders forwardlooking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan” “expect” “believe” “intend” “will” “anticipate” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with among other things discussions of future operations and financial performance as well as our strategy for growth product development regulatory approvals market position and expenditures all statements that address operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to volume growth sales and earnings per share growth cash flows or uses and statements expressing views about future operating results — are forwardlooking statements 

forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations of future events the forwardlooking statements are and will be based on management’s thencurrent views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of their dates investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize actual results could vary materially 

  

from our expectations and projections investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements furthermore we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information future events and developments or otherwise except as required by applicable law or regulations 

the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements for further discussion of certain of these factors see item 1a risk factors

foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues bd believes its activities in some countries outside the united states involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein as well as the economic environment local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties see further discussion of this risk in item 1a risk factors 

distribution 

bd’s products are marketed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to endusers by bd and independent sales representatives order backlog is not material to bd’s business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock bd’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the bd medical segment and respiratory and flu diagnostic products in the bd diagnostics segment that relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza 

raw materials 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products bd seeks to ensure continuity of raw material supply by securing multiple options for 

  

sourcing however there are situations where raw materials are only available from one supplier which are referred to as sole sourced the use of sole sourced materials may be due to sourcing of proprietary andor patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product in other cases while a raw material can be sourced from multiple manufacturers only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance cost or other considerations in order to provide alternate sources of raw materials bd must complete a rigorous qualification process which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval if clinical trials are not required this qualification process can take 318 months depending on the criticality of the change when clinical trials are required this process may lengthen the qualification phase for one to three years bd continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and maintains business continuity plans with our suppliers bd’s continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities maintaining contingency stock internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts while bd works closely with its suppliers there may nonetheless be events that cause supply interruption reduction or termination that adversely impacts bd’s ability to manufacture and sell certain products 

research and development 

bd conducts its research and development “rd” activities at its operating units and at bd technologies in research triangle park north carolina the majority of bd’s rd activities are conducted in the united states outside the united states bd conducts rd activities at bd diagnostic systems in quebec city canada and suzhou china bd pharmaceutical systems in pont de claix france bd technologies in biopolis singapore and bd medical surgical systems in tuas singapore bd also collaborates with certain universities medical centers and other entities on rd programs and retains individual consultants to support its efforts in specialized fields bd spent approximately 472 million 470 million and 423 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

intellectual property and licenses 

bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bd’s business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bd’s business as a whole or to any business segment 

competition 

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment in addition the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations are creating increased pricing pressures particularly in developing markets some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs 

bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product 

  

innovation and productivity improvement in support of its core strategy — to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers 

thirdparty reimbursement 

healthcare providers and related facilities are generally reimbursed for their services through numerous payment systems managed by various governmental agencies worldwide eg medicare and medicaid in the united states the national health service in the united kingdom the joint federal committee in germany the commission d’evaluation des produits et prestations in france the ministry for health labor and welfare in japan the ministry of health and the national development and reform commission in china among many others private insurance companies and managed care organizations the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer’s discretion the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of these thirdparty payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products thus changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products 

while bd is actively engaged in promoting the value propositions of its products for payer provider and patient stakeholders and it employs various efforts and resources to positively impact coverage coding and payment processes in this regard it has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and payment levels for bd products additionally we expect many payers to continue to explore costcontainment strategies eg comparative and costeffectiveness analyses socalled “payforperformance” programs implemented by various public and private payers and expansion of payment bundling schemes such as accountable care organizations acos drg programs and other such methods that shift medical cost risk to providers that could potentially impact coverage andor payment levels for current or future bd products 

as bd’s product offerings are diverse across many healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment systems therefore individual countries product lines or product classes may be impacted by changes to these systems notably the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” provides for numerous substantive changes to us healthcare payment systems many of the changes set forth in this statute have only recently been promulgated through formal regulations and most of them have yet to be implemented at this time it remains unclear whether or how the implementation of regulations pursuant to the ppaca might affect payments for bd products see item 1a risk factors for a further discussion 

regulation 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

bd actively maintains fdaiso quality systems that establish standards for its product design manufacturing and distribution processes prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews of bd’s quality systems as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials these regulatory controls as well as any changes in fda policies can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

  

bd also is subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the united states concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws global anticorruption transportation safety and health and customs and exports many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years this appears to be part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the united states 

bd believes it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable law and the regulations promulgated by the applicable agencies including without limitation environmental laws and regulations and that such compliance has not had and will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or results see item 3 legal proceedings 

employees 

as of september 30 2012 bd had 29555 employees of whom 11915 were employed in the us including puerto rico bd believes that its employee relations are satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors tableend an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows 

global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our operations 

in recent years we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions further deterioration in the global economic environment may result in decreased demand for our products and services increased competition downward pressure on the prices for our products longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new 

  

technologies during fiscal year 2012 our revenue growth was adversely affected by conditions in the healthcare industry including lower healthcare utilization particularly in the us and western europe increased pricing pressure for certain products in our medical segment and an uncertain academic research spending environment for highend instruments in our biosciences segment we anticipate that these industry conditions will continue for the foreseeable future in addition there can be no assurance that these conditions will not adversely affect our ability to do so in the future weakening macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers and there can be no assurances that bd will not experience any interruptions in supply in the future we have also experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain countries in western europe and we may experience similar delays in these and other jurisdictions experiencing liquidity problems the continued weakness in world economies makes the strength and timing of economic recovery uncertain and there can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not deteriorate further 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

about 57 of our fiscal year 2012 revenues were derived from international operations and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from our international operations in the future the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 7 management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks 

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources and by country may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states or abroad or changes in reimbursement rates by private payers could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using bd products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business 

federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” was enacted in march 2010 under the ppaca beginning in 2013 medical device manufacturers such as bd will pay a 23 excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices we currently estimate that our fiscal 2013 excise tax impacting only three quarters for fiscal year 2013 will be between 40 million to 50 million we cannot predict with any certainty what other impact the ppaca may have on our business the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures these factors in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursements for our products other provisions in the law may significantly change the practice of health care and could adversely affect aspects of our business while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the united states the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of bd’s products remains uncertain 

efforts to reduce the us federal deficit could adversely affect our results of operations 

as part of the budget control act passed in august 2011 to extend the federal debt limit and reduce government spending 12 trillion in automatic spending cuts known as sequestration over the next decade are 

  

due to go into effect beginning in 2013 in the absence of further legislative action half of the automatic reductions would come from lowering the caps imposed on nondefense discretionary spending and cutting domestic entitlement programs including reductions in payments to medicare providers government research funding could also be impacted as part of any deficit reduction any such reductions in government healthcare spending or research funding could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure 

price volatility could adversely affect costs associated with our operations 

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by price volatility in the cost of raw materials components freight and energy in particular bd purchases supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results increases in the price of oil can also increase bd’s costs for packaging and transportation new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of certain raw materials and components 

bd’s future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers the development of these products requires significant research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including bd’s ability to innovate develop and manufacture new products complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad or gain and maintain market approval of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 

we cannot guarantee that any of bd’s strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

as part of our strategy to increase revenue growth we seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 

the medical technology industry is very competitive 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features clinical outcomes price services and other factors in addition increasing customer demand for more environmentallyfriendly products is creating another basis on which bd must compete we face this competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations is also creating pricing pressure particularly in developing markets some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

the medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group 

  

purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has also placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

the international operations of bd’s business may subject bd to certain business risks 

the majority of our sales come from our operations outside the united states and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets especially in emerging markets bd operations outside the united states subject bd to certain risks including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above the effects of local economic conditions changes in foreign regulatory requirements local product preferences and product requirements difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations differing labor regulations changes in tax laws potential political instability trade barriers weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders the success of our operations outside the united states will depend in part on our ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and distribution networks 

in addition under the us tax code we may be subject to additional taxation to the extent we repatriate earnings from our foreign operations to the us in the event we require more capital in the united states than is generated by our us operations to fund acquisitions or other activities and elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rate may be higher as a result 

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our bd biosciences segment 

our bd biosciences segment sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and agencies in other countries the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods the availability of governmental research funding may also continue to be adversely affected by the current economic conditions and governmental spending reductions any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect bd’s manufacturing operations and related product sales 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials and components certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment and components are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons bd elects to purchase certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers the supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of reasons including economic conditions as described above while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in some instances the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants weather natural disasters including pandemics 

  

terrorism political change failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures equipment malfunction environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products 

bd is subject to a number of pending lawsuits 

bd is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits including purported class action lawsuits for among other things alleged antitrust violations and suits alleging patent infringement and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in item 3 legal proceedings given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse affect on bd’s results of operations and cash flows 

bd is subject to extensive regulation 

bd is subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of bd’s products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources and these have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda for supporting data for submissions the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products also governmental agencies may impose new requirements regarding registration labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable fda and other regulatory requirements continue to be met 

following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production marketing or sale of our products and result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances closure of manufacturing sites seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation recent changes in enforcement practice by the fda and other agencies have resulted in increased enforcement activity which increases the compliance risk for bd and other companies in our industry 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning system 

we are engaged in a project to upgrade our enterprise resource planning “erp” system our erp system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records record transactions provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements the implementation of the new erp system has required and will continue to require the investment of significant financial and human resources in 

  

addition we may not be able to successfully complete the implementation of the new erp system without experiencing difficulties any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 

many of bd’s businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property assets these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business bd can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position in addition competitors may claim that bd products infringe upon their intellectual property and resolving any intellectual property claim can be costly and timeconsuming the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

breaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations our information technology systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyber or phishingattacks if successful these cyberattacks could compromise our confidential information and disrupt our operations cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and there can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business 

natural disasters war and other events could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

natural disasters including pandemics war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts and actions taken by the united states and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and in areas outside of the united states in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers 

we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 

our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense bd’s ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected

 item 3 legal proceedings 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally bd is not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which bd is a party in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles bd establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries in view of the uncertainties discussed below bd could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows 

  

bd is named as a defendant in the following purported class action suits brought on behalf of distributors and other entities that purchase bd’s products the “distributor plaintiffs” alleging that bd violated federal antitrust laws resulting in the charging of higher prices for bd’s products to the plaintiffs and other purported class members 

 

 these actions have been consolidated under the caption “in re hypodermic products antitrust litigation” 

bd is also named as a defendant in the following purported class action suits brought on behalf of purchasers of bd’s products such as hospitals the “hospital plaintiffs” alleging that bd violated federal and state antitrust laws resulting in the charging of higher prices for bd’s products to the plaintiffs and other purported class members 

 

 the plaintiffs in each of the above antitrust class action lawsuits seek monetary damages all of the antitrust class action lawsuits have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in a multidistrict litigation in federal court in new jersey 

on april 27 2009 bd entered into a settlement agreement with the distributor plaintiffs in these actions the settlement agreement provides for among other things the payment by bd of 45000000 in exchange for a release by all potential class members of the direct purchaser claims under federal antitrust laws related to the products and acts enumerated in the complaint and a dismissal of the case with prejudice insofar as it relates to direct purchaser claims the release would not cover potential class members that affirmatively opt out of the settlement or indirect purchaser claims on september 30 2010 the district court denied a motion to approve the settlement agreement ruling that the hospital plaintiffs and not the distributor plaintiffs are the direct purchasers with standing to sue under federal antitrust laws on june 5 2012 the us court of appeals for the third circuit reversed the district court’s standing decision and ruled that the distributor plaintiffs not the hospital plaintiffs are direct purchasers entitled to pursue damages the hospital plaintiffs requested that the ruling be reconsidered but that request was denied the settlement agreement thus remains in effect subject to certain termination provisions and must be approved as to fairness by the district court the distributor plaintiffs have filed a motion requesting that the settlement agreement be preliminarily approved as fair and reasonable certain of the hospital plaintiffs have opposed that motion bd currently cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible losses with respect to these class action matters beyond the 45000000 already accrued 

  

and changes to the amount already recognized may be required in the future as additional information becomes available 

in june 2007 retractable technologies inc “rti” filed a complaint against bd under the caption retractable technologies inc vs becton dickinson and company civil action no 207cv250 us district court eastern district of texas rti alleges that the bd integra tm syringes infringe patents licensed exclusively to rti in its complaint rti also alleges that bd engaged in false advertising with respect to certain of bd’s safetyengineered products in violation of the lanham act acted to exclude rti from various product markets and to maintain its market share through among other things exclusionary contracts in violation of state and federal antitrust laws and engaged in unfair competition in january 2008 the court severed the patent and nonpatent claims into separate cases and stayed the nonpatent claims during the pendency of the patent claims at the trial court level rti seeks money damages and injunctive relief on april 1 2008 rti filed a complaint against bd under the caption retractable technologies inc and thomas j shaw v becton dickinson and company civil action no208cv141 us district court eastern district of texas rti alleges that the bd integra tm syringes infringe another patent licensed exclusively to rti rti seeks money damages and injunctive relief on august 29 2008 the court ordered the consolidation of the patent cases on november 9 2009 at a trial of these consolidated cases the jury rendered a verdict in favor of rti on all but one of its infringement claims but did not find any willful infringement and awarded rti 5000000 in damages on may 19 2010 the court granted rti’s motion for a permanent injunction against the continued sale by bd of its bd integra tm products in their current form but stayed the injunction for the duration of bd’s appeal at the same time the court lifted a stay of rti’s nonpatent claims on july 8 2011 the court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed the district court judgment that bd’s 3ml bd integra tm products infringed the asserted rti patents and affirmed the district court judgment of infringement against bd’s discontinued 1ml bd integra tm products on october 31 2011 the federal circuit court of appeals denied rti’s request for an en banc rehearing rti has filed a petition for review with the us supreme court the trial on rti’s antitrust and false advertising claims has been postponed pending resolution of rti’s appeal of the patent ruling 

with respect to rti’s antitrust and false advertising claims bd cannot estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss as there are significant legal and factual issues to be resolved these include discovery regarding rti’s alleged damages and liability theories which has not been completed each party has filed motions seeking to exclude portions of the other party’s expert testimony and to preclude the other party from introducing certain other evidence at trial rti’s appeal of the appellate court’s patent ruling to the us supreme court adds further uncertainty to the possible future outcomes of rti’s antitrust and false advertising claims in the event that rti ultimately succeeds at trial and subsequent appeals on its antitrust and false advertising claims any potential loss could be material as rti is seeking to recover substantial damages including disgorgement of profits and damages under the federal antitrust laws which are trebled bd believes rti’s allegations are without merit 

on october 19 2009 genprobe incorporated “genprobe” filed a patent infringement action against bd in the us district court for the southern district of california the complaint alleges that the bd viper tm and bd viper tm xtr tm systems and bd probetec tm specimen collection products infringe certain us patents of genprobe on march 23 2010 genprobe filed a complaint also in the us district court for the southern district of california alleging that the bd max tm instrument infringes genprobe patents the patents alleged to be infringed are a subset of the genprobe patents asserted against bd in the october 2009 suit on june 8 2010 the court consolidated these cases in a decision dated september 28 2012 the district court for the southern district of california issued a ruling on pretrial summary judgment motions the court ruled that some of genprobe’s asserted patent claims are infringed but other claims are not infringed thus reducing from six to four the number of patents to be contested at the trial and significant defense issues relating to patent invalidity inequitable conduct and standing remain to be adjudicated genprobe is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief bd currently cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible losses for this matter as there are significant issues to be resolved either prior to or at trial including issues regarding patent invalidity inequitable conduct and standing as well as motions seeking to exclude portions of the other party’s expert testimony and to preclude the other party from introducing certain other evidence at trial 

bd believes that it has meritorious defenses to each of the abovementioned suits pending against bd and is engaged in a vigorous defense of each of these matters 

  

bd is also involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 

bd is a party to a number of federal proceedings in the united states brought under the comprehensive environment response compensation and liability act also known as “superfund” and similar state laws the affected sites are in varying stages of development in some instances the remedy has been completed while in others environmental studies are commencing for all sites there are other potentially responsible parties that may be jointly or severally liable to pay all cleanup costs

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

financial review 

company overview 

description of the company and business segments 

becton dickinson and company “bd” is a global medical technology company engaged principally in the development manufacture and sale of medical devices instrument systems and reagents used by healthcare institutions life science researchers clinical laboratories the pharmaceutical industry and the general public our business consists of three worldwide business segments — bd medical “medical” bd diagnostics “diagnostics” and bd biosciences “biosciences” our products are marketed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to endusers by bd and independent sales representatives references to years throughout this discussion relate to our fiscal years which end on september 30 

strategic objectives 

bd remains focused on delivering sustainable growth and shareholder value while making appropriate investments for the future bd management operates the business consistent with the following core strategies 

 

  

  

  

  

 our strategy focuses on four specific areas within healthcare and life sciences 

 

  

  

  

 we continue to strive to improve the efficiency of our capital structure and follow these guiding principles 

 

  

  

 in assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as bd’s financial condition and operating performance management generally reviews quarterly forecast data monthly actual results segment sales and other similar information we also consider trends related to certain key financial data including gross profit margin selling and administrative expense investment in research and development return on invested capital and cash flows 

summary of financial results 

worldwide revenues in 2012 of 77 billion increased 16 from the prior year and reflected estimated volume increases of 52 which included growth from acquisitions of 11 partially offset by estimated unfavorable foreign exchange translation of 27 and estimated price decreases of 09 solid growth from our 

  

medical and diagnostics segments was primarily driven by new product launches and growth from recent acquisitions safetyengineered products and emerging markets revenues in the united states in 2012 of 33 billion increased 1 reflecting pricing pressures for certain medical surgical systems products and an increasingly competitive market for microbiology products in addition biosciences revenue in the us declined due to reduced research funding and constrained demand for highend instruments international revenues in 2012 of 44 billion increased 2 which reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 5 international revenues for 2012 reflected growth from all segments including growth attributable to emerging markets as well as strong sales of safetyengineered products sales in the united states of safetyengineered devices grew 3 to 115 billion in 2012 from 112 billion in 2011 international sales of safetyengineered devices were 834 million in 2012 compared with 755 million in 2011 or 105 growth which included an estimated 5 negative impact due to unfavorable foreign currency translation international safetyengineered device revenue growth continues to be driven by strong sales in the medical segment with the largest growth in emerging markets including china and latin america 

we continue to invest in research and development spending geographic expansion and new product promotions to drive further revenue and profit growth our ability to sustain our longterm growth will depend on a number of factors including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion develop innovative new products with higher gross profit margins across our business segments and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness the healthcare industry continues to face a challenging economic environment the current economic conditions and other circumstances have resulted in pricing pressures for some of our products as mentioned above our biosciences segment continues to be impacted by an uncertain research spending environment and lack of overall demand for instruments and research reagents in other areas of our us business healthcare utilization is stable but constrained additionally uncertainty in europe due to continued macroeconomic challenges has resulted in constrained healthcare utilization in that region 

in addition to the economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere numerous other factors can affect our ability to achieve our goals including without limitation increased competition and healthcare reform initiatives for example the us healthcare reform law contains certain tax provisions that will affect bd the most significant impact is the medical device excise tax which imposes a 23 tax on certain us sales of medical devices beginning in january 2013 we currently estimate that our fiscal 2013 excise tax impacting only three quarters for fiscal year 2013 will be between 40 million to 50 million and will be recorded in selling and administrative expense 

our financial position remains strong with cash flows from operating activities totaling 17 billion in 2012 at september 30 2012 we had 22 billion in cash and equivalents and shortterm investments cash outflows relating to acquisitions included the purchase of kiestra lab automation bv “kiestra” a netherlandsbased company that manufactures and sells innovative lab automation solutions for the microbiology lab for 51 million net of cash acquired the company also paid 52 million net of cash acquired for sirigen group limited “sirigen” a developer of unique polymer dyes that are used in flow cytometry capital expenditures were 487 million in 2012 as we continue to invest in capacity across our segments to support future growth in november 2011 we issued 500 million of 5year 175 notes and 1 billion of 10year 3125 notes as discussed further below also we continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends during 2012 we repurchased 15 billion of our common stock and paid cash dividends of 368 million 

we face currency exposure each reporting period that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period we evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a foreign currencyneutral basis which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we calculate foreign currencyneutral percentages by converting our currentperiod local currency financial results using the priorperiod foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our currentperiod reported results from time to time we may purchase forward contracts and options to partially protect against adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on our derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes for further discussion refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

divestiture 

in april 2012 we signed a definitive agreement to sell biosciences’ discovery labware unit excluding its advanced bioprocessing platform the results of operations associated with this disposal group have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of income and cash flows and related disclosures we completed the sale on october 31 2012 gross proceeds from the sale were approximately 728 million subject to postclosing adjustments and we expect to record a gain on the sale within discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 see note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

results of continuing operations 

comparisons of income from continuing operations between 2012 and 2011 are affected by the following items that are reflected in our financial results 

 

  

 medical segment 

medical revenues in 2012 of 41 billion increased 21 over 2011 which reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 30 

the following is a summary of medical revenues by organizational unit 

 

  

 

 medical segment revenue growth on a foreign currencyneutral basis reflected solid growth in all units medical surgical systems revenue reflected solid growth of international safetyengineered product sales and growth from sales of the bd phaseal™ product resulting from the carmel pharma ab “carmel” acquisition that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 diabetes care revenue growth reflected continued strong sales of pen needles including sales of the bd ultrafine™ nano pharmaceutical systems revenue reflected the continued strong demand from companies producing biotech drugs and certain heparin products global sales of safetyengineered products were 966 million compared with 885 million in the prior year and included an estimated 14 million unfavorable impact due to foreign currency translation 

medical operating income in 2012 was 12 billion or 284 of medical revenues as compared with 12 billion or 295 of revenues in 2011 gross profit margin was lower in the current year than in 2011 primarily due to amortization of intangibles associated with the carmel acquisition unfavorable pricing impacts on certain product lines and the unfavorable impact of decreased sales of products which have higher gross margins these 

  

unfavorable impacts on gross profit margin were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation and lower manufacturing costs resulting from project reloco a global crossfunctional business initiative to drive sustained lowcost capability primarily benefitting medical surgical systems see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of medical revenues in 2012 increased to 177 of revenues from 175 of revenues in 2011 primarily due to increased spending for expansion in emerging markets and higher expenses resulting from the carmel acquisition as compared with the prior year’s period partially offset by continued spending controls and favorable foreign currency translation research and development expenses in 2012 increased 11 million or 8 and reflected continued investment in the development of new products and platforms including new diabetes care and closed system transfer devices

diagnostics operating income in 2012 was 653 million or 257 of diagnostics revenues compared with 636 million or 257 of revenues in 2011 gross profit margin in the diagnostics segment was down as compared to the prior year and reflected unfavorable foreign currency translation higher raw material costs and the unfavorable impact of decreased sales of products which have higher gross margins see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of diagnostics revenues increased by 10 basis points in 2012 to 216 primarily due to investments in emerging markets partially offset by continued spending controls and favorable foreign currency translation research and development expense decreased 9 million or 5 from 2011 reflecting a program termination in 2011 current year rd spending reflected our continued investment in the development of new products and platforms including the bd max ™ and new bd viper ™ platforms and menus 

biosciences segment 

biosciences revenues which include the cell analysis unit and the advanced bioprocessing platform of 11 billion in 2012 decreased 15 from 2011 and reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 22 biosciences revenue growth on a foreign currencyneutral basis was primarily driven by instrument and reagent sales in emerging markets partially offset by declines in the us due to constrained research spending 

  

biosciences operating income in 2012 was 262 million or 242 of biosciences revenues compared with 278 million or 254 in 2011 the segment’s operating income in 2012 reflected a lower gross profit margin than 2011 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and amortization of capitalized software as well as intangibles associated with the 2011 acquisition of accuri cytometers inc “accuri” the segment’s gross profit margin was also unfavorably impacted by increases in certain raw material costs see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of biosciences revenues was 244 in 2012 as compared with 245 in 2011 and reflected continued spending controls partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation research and development spending was relatively flat to prior year and reflects spending on new products and platforms including next generation cell sorters and analyzers 

geographic revenues 

revenues in the united states in 2012 of 33 billion increased 1 growth in us medical revenues reflected strong sales of pharmaceutical systems and diabetes care products which were partially offset by pricing pressures for certain medical surgical systems products diagnostic systems revenue growth in the us was unfavorably affected by an increasingly competitive market for microbiology products and weak sales from our geneohm™ healthcareassociated infections “hai” platform also due to a challenging competitive environment biosciences revenues in the us declined in the current year compared with the prior year due to reduced research funding as we continue to experience constrained demand for highend instruments due to continued funding concerns in the pharmaceutical and biotech research markets as well as in the academic markets 

international revenues in 2012 of 44 billion increased 2 which reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 5 international revenues for 2012 reflected growth from all segments including growth attributable to emerging markets as well as strong sales of safetyengineered products 

gross profit margin 

gross profit margin was 513 in 2012 compared with 522 in 2011 the decrease in gross profit margin reflected the estimated net unfavorable impact of 70 basis points relating to operating performance an estimated 10 basis points relating to unfavorable foreign currency translation and an estimated 10 basis points relating to pension settlements operating performance was adversely affected by an estimated 50 basis points due to the impact of decreased sales of products which have higher gross margins operating performance also reflected the estimated impacts of 50 basis points due to unfavorable pricing impacts on certain product lines as well as 20 basis points due to increases in certain raw material costs operating performance was also adversely impacted by approximately 10 basis points due to amortization of intangibles associated with recent acquisitions approximately 20 basis points due to biosciences software amortization and approximately 30 basis points due to other unfavorable onetime impacts the unfavorable impacts on operating performance for the current year were partially offset by an estimated 80 basis points due to lower manufacturing costs from continuous improvement projects such as project reloco and lower pension costs operating performance was also favorably impacted by approximately 30 basis points due to the change in useful lives of certain machinery and equipment assets see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 for additional discussion 

operating expenses 

selling and administrative expense in 2012 was 19 billion or 25 of revenues compared with 18 billion or 24 of revenues in 2011 aggregate expenses for 2012 reflected an increase in core spending of 105 million primarily relating to expansion of our business in emerging markets transactions costs relating to the kiestra acquisition and higher expenses resulting from the carmel and kiestra acquisitions aggregate expenses for the current year also included increased spending of 23 million related to our global enterprise resource planning initiative to update our business information systems and 8 million related to pension settlements additionally aggregate expenses in the current year included a 16 million increase in the deferred compensation plan liability as further discussed below these increases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation of 41 million and lower pension expense of 11 million 

  

research and development “rd” expense in 2012 was 472 million or 61 of revenues compared with 470 million or 62 of revenues in 2011 the increase in rd expenditures includes spending for new products and platforms in each of our segments as previously discussed current year expense also includes 2 million associated with pension settlements rd expense in 2011 included a noncash impairment charge of 9 million resulting from the discontinuance of a research program within the diagnostic systems unit 

nonoperating expense and income 

interest expense in 2012 was 135 million compared with 84 million in 2011 the increase reflected higher levels of longterm fixedrate debt partially offset by lower average interest rates on this debt as well as a reduction in the amount of capitalized interest the reduction in capitalized interest was attributable to a lower average interest rate on the overall debt portfolio interest income was 50 million in 2012 compared with 43 million in 2011 the increase was largely the result of investment gains on assets related to our deferred compensation plan offset partially by the impact of lower interest rates and lower investment levels in certain nonus locations the offsetting movements in the deferred compensation plan liability were recorded in selling and administrative expenses 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate in 2012 of 246 was lower compared with the 2011 rate of 258 the 2012 rate reflected the favorable impact of various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions while 2011 reflected the favorable impact due to the timing of certain tax benefits resulting from the retroactive extension of the us research tax credit and a european restructuring transaction 

income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2012 were 11 billion and 530 respectively the charge related to pension settlements decreased income from continuing operations in 2012 by 13 million or 006 per share earnings in 2012 also reflected an estimated overall net unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of 021 per share income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 were 12 billion and 531 respectively the charge related to the discontinuance of a research program decreased income from continuing operations in 2011 by 6 million or 003 per share 

financial instrument market risk 

we selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations the counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign exchange risk 

bd and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout europe asia pacific canada japan and latin america we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency these payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions we hedge substantially all such exposures primarily through the use of forward contracts we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations including sales to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period from time to time we purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted sales that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future sales resulting from adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on our derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions we did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows in fiscal year 2012 

  

derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value for foreign currency derivatives market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities with respect to the derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2012 a 10 appreciation of the us dollar over a oneyear period would decrease pretax earnings by 8 million while a 10 depreciation of the us dollar would increase pretax earnings by 8 million comparatively considering our derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2011 a 10 appreciation of the us dollar over a oneyear period would have decreased pretax earnings by 23 million while a 10 depreciation of the us dollar would have increased pretax earnings by 23 million these calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments 

interest rate risk 

our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates our debt and interestbearing investments at september 30 2012 are substantially all us dollardenominated therefore transaction and translation exposure relating to such instruments is minimal when managing interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments we may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interestbearing investments in tandem since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure for interest rate derivative instruments fair values are provided by the financial institutions that are counterparties to these arrangements market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities a change in interest rates on shortterm debt and interestbearing investments impacts our earnings and cash flow but not the fair value of these instruments because of their limited duration a change in interest rates on longterm debt is assumed to impact the fair value of the debt but not our earnings or cash flow because the interest on such obligations is fixed based on our overall interest rate exposure at september 30 2012 and 2011 a change of 10 in interest rates would not have a material effect on our earnings or cash flows over a oneyear period an increase of 10 in interest rates would decrease the aggregate fair value of our longterm debt and related fair value hedges at september 30 2012 and 2011 by approximately 109 million and 90 million respectively a 10 decrease in interest rates would increase the aggregate fair value of these same financial instruments at september 30 2012 and 2011 by approximately 115 million and 96 million respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash flows from continuing operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2012 was 17 billion compared with 16 billion in 2011 the current year change in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net use of cash and primarily reflected higher levels of inventory and accounts receivables substantially offset by lower levels of prepaid expenses net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2012 was reduced by changes in the pension obligation resulting primarily from a discretionary cash contribution of 100 million an additional discretionary contribution of 100 million was made to the us pension plan in october 2012 

net cash flows from continuing investing activities 

capital expenditures 

our investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities and support our strategy of geographic expansion with select investments in growing markets capital expenditures were 487 million in 2012 compared with 509 million in 2011 capital spending for the medical diagnostics and biosciences segments in 2012 was 363 million 101 million and 14 million respectively and related primarily to manufacturing capacity expansions

net cash flows from continuing financing activities 

debt issuances and payments of obligations 

on november 3 2011 we issued 500 million of 5year 175 notes and 1 billion of 10year 3125 notes shortterm debt increased to 97 of total debt at the end of 2012 from 86 at the end of 2011 floating rate debt was 97 of total debt at the end of 2012 and 16 at the end of 2011 our weighted average cost of total debt at the end of 2012 was 37 down from 49 at the end of 2011 debttocapitalization ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt shareholders’ equity and net noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities at september 30 2012 was 497 compared with 358 at september 30 2011 

repurchase of common stock 

we repurchased approximately 199 million shares of our common stock for 15 billion in 2012 and 184 million shares for 15 billion in 2011 a total of approximately 82 million common shares remain available for purchase at september 30 2012 under the board of directors’ july 2011 repurchase authorization we plan on share repurchases of approximately 500 million in 2013 subject to market conditions 

cash and shortterm investments 

at september 30 2012 total worldwide cash and shortterm investments were 218 billion of which 175 billion was held in jurisdictions outside of the united states we regularly review the amount of cash and shortterm investments held outside the united states and currently intend to use most of such amounts to fund our international operations and their growth initiatives however if these amounts were moved out of these jurisdictions or repatriated to the united states there could be tax consequences 

government receivables 

accounts receivable balances include sales to governmentowned or governmentsupported healthcare facilities in several countries which are subject to delays payment is dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries’ national economies deteriorating credit and economic conditions in parts of western europe particularly in italy and spain may continue to increase the average length of time it takes us to collect our accounts receivable in certain regions within these countries outstanding governmental receivable balances net of reserves in italy and spain at september 30 2012 were 71 million and 43 million respectively 

we continually evaluate all governmental receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices we believe the current reserves related to all governmental receivables are adequate and that this concentration of credit risk will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity 

credit facilities 

we have in place a commercial paper borrowing program that is available to meet our shortterm financing needs including working capital requirements borrowings outstanding under this program were 200 million at 

  

september 30 2012 during the third quarter we established a 1 billion syndicated credit facility with an expiration date of may 2017 replacing a 1 billion facility due to expire in december 2012 this new credit facility under which there were no borrowings outstanding at september 30 2012 provides backup support for our commercial paper program and can also be used for other general corporate purposes it includes a provision that enables bd subject to additional commitments made by the lenders to access up to an additional 500 million in financing through the facility for a maximum aggregate commitment of 15 billion the credit facility includes a single financial covenant that requires bd to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio ratio of earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 5to1 for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters on the last eight measurement dates this ratio has ranged from 13to1 to 26to1 in addition we have informal lines of credit outside the united states 

access to capital and credit ratings 

our ability to generate cash flow from operations issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms could be adversely affected in the event there was a material decline in the demand for our products deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions 

bd’s credit ratings at september 30 2012 which reflect an action by moody’s on september 12 2012 that placed our ratings under review for downgrade were as follows 

 

 on october 3 2012 moody’s downgraded bd’s senior unsecured debt rating to a3 and lowered its commercial paper rating to prime2 while changing its outlook to “stable” 

while further deterioration in our credit ratings would increase the costs associated with maintaining and borrowing under our existing credit arrangements such a downgrade would not affect our ability to draw on these credit facilities nor would it result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any outstanding debt we believe that given our debt ratings our conservative financial management policies our ability to generate cash flow and the noncyclical geographically diversified nature of our businesses we would have access to additional shortterm and longterm capital should the need arise 

contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future the table below sets forth bd’s significant contractual obligations and related scheduled payments

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue from product sales is typically recognized when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered product price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

for certain instruments sold from the biosciences segment we recognize revenue upon installation at a customer’s site as installation of these instruments is considered a significant postdelivery obligation for certain sales arrangements primarily in the us with multiple deliverables revenue and cost of products sold are recognized at the completion of each deliverable shipment installation and training these sales agreements are divided into separate units of accounting and revenue is recognized upon the completion of each deliverable based on its relative selling price the relative selling prices of installation and training are determined based on the prices at which these deliverables would be regularly sold on a standalone basis the relative selling prices of instruments are based on estimated selling prices these estimates represent the quoted sales contract price in each arrangement 

bd’s domestic businesses sell products primarily to distributors who resell the products to enduser customers we provide rebates to distributors that sell to enduser customers at prices determined under a contract between bd and the enduser customer provisions for rebates which are based on historical information for all rebates that have not yet been processed as well as sales discounts and returns are accounted for as a reduction of revenues when revenue is recognized 

  

impairment of assets 

goodwill and inprocess research and development assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with finite lives including core and developed technology and other longlived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units generally represent one level below reporting segments and we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics potential impairment of goodwill is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value our annual goodwill impairment test for 2012 did not result in any impairment charges as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

we generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with bd’s business plans the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and potentially result in different impacts to bd’s results of operations actual results may differ from management’s estimates 

income taxes 

bd maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 

bd conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions our past audit experience with similar situations and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters bd’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if upon resolution with taxing authorities we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

bd has reviewed its needs in the us for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and with exception for certain countries continues to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the us to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property plant and equipment expenditure needs   deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested at september 30 2012 the cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the united states was 44 billion the determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation 

contingencies 

we are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including without limitation product liability antitrust and environmental matters as further discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses we establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries a determination of the 

  

amount of accruals if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue and when appropriate is developed after consultation with outside counsel the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows 

benefit plans 

we have significant net pension and other postretirement benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate and expected return on plan assets other postretirement benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rates these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

the discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date september 30 for the us pension plan we will use a discount rate of 39 for 2013 which was based on an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve the rate selected is used to measure liabilities as of the measurement date and for calculating the following year’s pension expense the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption although reviewed each year changes less frequently due to the longterm nature of the assumption this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date rather it is used only in the calculation of pension expense to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider many factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results benchmark data expected returns on various plan asset classes as well as current and expected asset allocations we will use a longterm expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 775 for the us pension plan in 2013 we believe our discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our us pension and other postretirement plans are as follows 

 

  

 sharebased compensation 

compensation cost relating to sharebased payment transactions is recognized in net income using a fair value measurement method all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options are recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense based on their fair values over the vesting period of the awards we determine the fair value of certain sharebased awards using a latticebased binomial option valuation model that incorporates certain assumptions such as the riskfree interest rate expected volatility expected dividend yield and expected life of the options see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

  

cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

bd and its representatives may from time to time make certain forwardlooking statements in publicly released materials both written and oral including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission press releases and our reports to shareholders forwardlooking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan” “expect” “believe” “intend” “will” “anticipate” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with among other things discussions of future operations and financial performance as well as our strategy for growth product development regulatory approvals market position and expenditures all statements that address operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to volume growth sales and earnings per share growth cash flows or uses and statements expressing views about future operating results — are forwardlooking statements 

forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations of future events the forwardlooking statements are and will be based on managements thencurrent views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of their dates investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements furthermore we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information future events and developments or otherwise except as required by applicable law or regulations

foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues bd believes its activities in some countries outside the united states involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein as well as the economic environment local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties see further discussion of this risk in item 1a risk factors 

 

distribution 

 

bd’s products are marketed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to endusers by bd and independent sales representatives no customer accounted for 10 or more of revenues in fiscal year 2011 order backlog is not material to bd’s business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock bd’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the bd medical segment and respiratory and flu diagnostic products in the bd diagnostics segment that relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza 

 

raw materials 

 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment are not available from multiple sources in the case of certain principal raw materials that are available from multiple sources for various reasons including quality assurance and cost effectiveness bd elects to purchase these raw materials from sole suppliers in cases where there are regulatory requirements relating to qualification of suppliers bd may not be able to 

establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis while bd works closely with its suppliers to ensure continuity of supply the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 

 

research and development 

 

bd conducts its research and development “rd” activities at its operating units and at bd technologies in research triangle park north carolina the majority of bd’s rd activities are conducted in the united states outside the united states bd conducts rd activities at bd diagnostic systems in quebec city canada and suzhou china bd pharmaceutical systems in pont de claix france and bd medical surgical systems in tuas singapore bd also collaborates with certain universities medical centers and other entities on rd programs and retains individual consultants to support its efforts in specialized fields bd spent approximately 476 million 431 million and 405 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively fiscal 2011 spending included a 9 million charge resulting from the discontinuance of a research program 

 

intellectual property and licenses 

 

bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bd’s business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bd’s business as a whole or to any business segment 

 

competition 

 

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace whose dynamics are changing technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment in addition the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations are creating increased pricing pressures particularly in developing markets some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs new entrants may also appear particularly from these lowcost countries 

 

bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement in support of its core strategy — to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers 

 

thirdparty reimbursement 

 

healthcare providers and related facilities are generally reimbursed for their services through numerous payment systems managed by various governmental agencies worldwide eg medicare and medicaid in the 

united states the national health service in the united kingdom the joint federal committee in germany the commission d’evaluation des produits et prestations in france the ministry for health labor and welfare in japan the ministry of health and the national development and reform commission in china among many others private insurance companies and managed care organizations the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer’s discretion the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of these thirdparty payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products thus changes in reimbursement level or method may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products 

 

while bd is actively engaged in promoting the value of its products for payers and patients and it employs various efforts and resources to positively impact coverage coding and payment processes in this regard it has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and payment levels for bd products additionally we expect many payers to continue to explore costcontainment strategies eg comparative and costeffectiveness analyses socalled “payforperformance” programs implemented by various public and private payers and expansion of payment bundling schemes such as accountable care organizations acos drg programs and other such methods that shift medical cost risk to providers that could potentially impact coverage andor payment levels for current or future bd products 

 

as bd’s product offerings are diverse across many healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment systems therefore individual countries product lines or product classes may be impacted by changes to these systems notably the recentlyenacted healthcare reform legislation in the united states ie the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” provides for numerous substantive changes to us healthcare payment systems many of the changes set forth in this statute have only recently been promulgated through formal regulations and most of them have yet to be implemented at this time it remains unclear whether or how the implementation of regulations pursuant to the ppaca might affect payments for bd products see item 1a risk factors for a further discussion 

 

regulation 

 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

 

bd actively maintains fdaiso quality systems that establish standards for its product design manufacturing and distribution processes prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews of bd’s quality systems as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials these regulatory controls as well as any changes in fda policies can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes 

 

these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

 

bd also is subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the united states concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws global anticorruption transportation safety and health and customs and exports many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years this 

appears to be part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the united states 

 

bd believes it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable law and the regulations promulgated by the applicable agencies including without limitation environmental laws and regulations and that such compliance has not had and will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or results see item 3 legal proceedings 

 

employees 

 

as of september 30 2011 bd had 29369 employees of whom 12041 were employed in the us including puerto rico bd believes that its employee relations are satisfactory 

 

other matters 

 

becton dickinson france sa “bdfrance” a subsidiary of bd was listed among approximately 2200 other companies in an october 27 2005 report of the independent inquiry committee “iic” of the united nations “un” as having been involved in humanitarian contracts in which unauthorized payments were suspected of having been made to the iraqi government in connection with the un’s oilforfood programme the “programme” in connection with the iic’s report becton dickinson ag a swiss subsidiary of bd received a letter of inquiry from the vendor review committee “vrc” of the united nations procurement service dated november 22 2005 the letter of inquiry said that the vrc is reviewing becton dickinson ag’s registration status in light of bdfrance being listed in the iic’s report and asked us for any information we might be able to provide relating to the findings of the report bd conducted an internal review and found no evidence that bd or any bd employee made authorized or approved improper payments to the iraqi government in connection with the programme the representative utilized by bd in iraq also unequivocally denied having made any such payments and bd was unable to find any evidence of such payments being made by this representative bd reported the results of its internal review to the vrc in may 2008 bd received a letter from the un stating that becton dickinson ag had been suspended from the un secretariat procurement division’s vendor roster for a minimum period of six months we have requested that becton dickinson ag be reinstated bd believes that the suspension has not had and will not have a material adverse effect on bd 

 

in may 2007 the french judicial police conducted searches of bdfrance’s offices in france with respect to the matters that were the subject of the 2005 iic report we were informed that bdfrance is one of a number of companies named in the iic report that is being investigated by the french judicial police in june 2009 the belgian federal police contacted bd to interview certain individuals and review documents related to sales made under the programme we are cooperating fully with these investigations

forwardlooking statements 

 

bd and its representatives may from timetotime make certain forwardlooking statements in publiclyreleased materials both written and oral including statements contained in filings with the sec and in our reports to shareholders additional information regarding our forwardlooking statements is contained in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows 

 

current economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our operations 

 

the global economic conditions may result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services increased pricing pressure longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies during fiscal year 2011 our revenue growth was adversely affected by conditions in the healthcare industry including lower healthcare utilization particularly in the us and western europe cost containment efforts by governments and other payors for healthcare services and other factors these conditions resulted in weaker overall customer demand and increased pricing pressure for some of our products we anticipate that these industry conditions will continue for the foreseeable future in addition while the economic downturn has not impaired our ability to access credit markets to date there can be no assurance that these conditions will not adversely affect our ability to do so in the future the current macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers and there can be no assurances that bd will not experience any interruptions in supply in the future we have also experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain countries in western europe and we may experience similar delays in these and other jurisdictions experiencing liquidity problems the continued weakness in world economies makes the strength and timing of any economic recovery uncertain and there can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not deteriorate further 

 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

 

over half of our fiscal year 2011 revenues were derived from international operations our revenues outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 7 management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks 

 

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states as part of healthcare reform or otherwise as discussed below or abroad could significantly 

reduce reimbursement for procedures using bd products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business 

 

federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

 

the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” was enacted in march 2010 under the ppaca beginning in 2013 medical device manufacturers such as bd will pay a 23 excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices sales of bd products that we estimate to be subject to this tax represented about 80 of bd’s total us revenues in fiscal year 2011 we cannot predict with any certainty what other impact the ppaca may have on our business the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures these factors in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursements for our products while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the united states the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of bd’s products remains uncertain 

 

efforts to reduce the us federal deficit could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

as part of the law passed in august 2011 to extend the federal debt limit and reduce government spending a bipartisan committee was established to identify up to 15 trillion in cuts to federal programs on november 21 2011 the joint committee announced that it would not reach an agreement by the prescribed deadline which will trigger an automatic 12 trillion in additional spending cuts in the absence of further legislative action half of the automatic reductions would come from lowering the caps imposed on domestic discretionary spending and cutting domestic entitlement programs including reductions in payments to medicare providers government research funding could also be impacted as part of any deficit reduction any such reductions in government healthcare spending or research funding could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure 

 

price volatility could adversely affect costs associated with our operations 

 

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by price volatility in the cost of raw materials components freight and energy in particular bd purchases supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products any significant increases in resin purchase costs could impact future operating results increases in the price of oil can also increase bd’s costs for packaging and transportation new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of certain raw materials and components these cost increases may adversely affect our profitability 

 

bd’s future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers the development of these products requires significant research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including bd’s ability to innovate develop and manufacture new products complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad or gain and maintain market approval of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 

we cannot guarantee that any of bd’s strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

 

as part of our strategy to increase revenue growth we seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 

 

the medical technology industry is very competitive 

 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in addition increasing customer demand for more environmentallyfriendly products is creating another basis on which bd must compete the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations is also creating pricing pressure particularly in developing markets some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs new entrants may also appear particularly from these lowcost countries 

 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

 

the medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has also placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

 

the international operations of bd’s business may subject bd to certain business risks 

 

bd operations outside the united states subject bd to certain risks including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above the effects of local economic conditions changes in foreign regulatory requirements local product preferences difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations differing labor regulations changes in tax laws potential political instability trade barriers weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders the success of our operations outside the united states will depend in part on our ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and distribution networks 

 

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our bd biosciences segment 

 

our bd biosciences segment sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and agencies in other countries the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable there have been instances where nih 

grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods the availability of governmental research funding may also continue to be adversely affected by the current economic downturn any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 

 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect bd’s manufacturing operations and related product sales 

 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials and components certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment and components are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons bd elects to purchase certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers the supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of reasons including current economic conditions as described above while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition where there are regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials and components could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 

 

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in addition in some instances the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants as a result weather natural disasters including pandemics terrorism political change failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures equipment malfunction environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products 

 

bd is subject to a number of pending lawsuits 

 

bd is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits including purported class action lawsuits for among other things alleged antitrust violations and patent infringement and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in item 3 legal proceedings given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could adversely affect bd’s results of operations and cash flows 

 

bd is subject to extensive regulation 

 

bd is subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of bd’s products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources and these have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda for supporting data for submissions the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products also governmental agencies may impose new requirements regarding registration labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable fda and other regulatory requirements continue to be met 

 

following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the 

production marketing or sale of our products and result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances closure of manufacturing sites seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation recent changes in enforcement practice by the fda and other agencies have resulted in increased enforcement activity which increases the compliance risk for bd and other companies in our industry 

 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

 

we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning system 

 

we are engaged in a project to upgrade our enterprise resource planning “erp” system our erp system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records record transactions provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements the design and implementation of the new erp system has required and will continue to require the investment of significant financial and human resources the total cost needed to implement the new erp system may turn out to be more than we currently anticipate in addition we may not be able to successfully implement the new erp system without experiencing difficulties any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 

 

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 

 

many of bd’s businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property assets while we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other intellectual property asset would materially adversely affect bd operations these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business bd can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows in addition competitors may claim that bd products infringe upon their intellectual property resolving any intellectual property claim can be costly and timeconsuming 

 

natural disasters war and other events could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

 

natural disasters including pandemics war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts and actions taken by the united states and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and in areas outside of the united states in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers 

we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 

 

our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense bd’s ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

bd is named as a defendant in the following purported class action suits brought on behalf of distributors and other entities that purchase bd’s products the “distributor plaintiffs” alleging that bd violated federal antitrust laws resulting in the charging of higher prices for bd’s products to the plaintiffs and other purported class members 

 

 

 

these actions have been consolidated under the caption “in re hypodermic products antitrust litigation” 

 

bd is also named as a defendant in the following purported class action suits brought on behalf of purchasers of bd’s products such as hospitals the “hospital plaintiffs” alleging that bd violated federal and state antitrust laws resulting in the charging of higher prices for bd’s products to the plaintiffs and other purported class members 

 

 

 

the plaintiffs in each of the above antitrust class action lawsuits seek monetary damages all of the antitrust class action lawsuits have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in a multidistrict litigation mdl in federal court in new jersey 

 

on april 27 2009 bd entered into a settlement agreement with the distributor plaintiffs in these actions the settlement agreement provided for among other things the payment by bd of 45 million in exchange for a release by all potential class members of the direct purchaser claims under federal antitrust laws related to the products and acts enumerated in the complaint and a dismissal of the case with prejudice insofar as it relates to direct purchaser claims the release would not cover potential class members that affirmatively opt out of the settlement on september 30 2010 the court issued an order denying a motion to approve the settlement agreement ruling that the hospital plaintiffs and not the distributor plaintiffs are the direct purchasers entitled to pursue damages under the federal antitrust laws for certain sales of bd products the settlement agreement currently remains in effect subject to certain termination provisions and the federal court of appeals has granted the distributor plaintiffs’ request to appeal the trial court’s order on an interlocutory basis bd currently cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible losses with respect to these class action matters beyond the 45 million already accrued and changes to the amount already recognized may be required in the future as additional information becomes available

on october 19 2009 genprobe incorporated “genprobe” filed a patent infringement action against bd in the us district court for the southern district of california the complaint alleges that the bd viper tm and bd viper tm xtr tm systems and bd probetec tm specimen collection products infringe certain us patents of genprobe on march 23 2010 genprobe filed a complaint also in the us district court for the southern district of california alleging that the bd max tm instrument infringes genprobe patents the patents alleged to be infringed are a subset of the genprobe patents asserted against bd in the october 2009 suit on june 8 2010 the court consolidated these cases genprobe is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief bd currently cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible losses for this matter as the proceedings are in relatively early stages and there are significant issues to be resolved 

 

bd believes that it has meritorious defenses to each of the abovementioned suits pending against bd and is engaged in a vigorous defense of each of these matters 

 

bd is also involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 

 

bd is a party to a number of federal proceedings in the united states brought under the comprehensive environment response compensation and liability act also known as “superfund” and similar state laws the affected sites are in varying stages of development in some instances the remedy has been completed while in others environmental studies are commencing for all sites there are other potentially responsible parties that may be jointly or severally liable to pay all cleanup costs 

 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally bd is not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which bd is a party in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles bd establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries in view of the uncertainties discussed below bd could incur charges in excess of any currently 

established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows

financial review 

 

company overview 

 

description of the company and business segments 

 

becton dickinson and company “bd” is a global medical technology company engaged principally in the development manufacture and sale of medical devices instrument systems and reagents used by healthcare institutions life science researchers clinical laboratories the pharmaceutical industry and the general public our business consists of three worldwide business segments — bd medical “medical” bd diagnostics “diagnostics” and bd biosciences “biosciences” our products are marketed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to endusers by bd and independent sales representatives references to years throughout this discussion relate to our fiscal years which end on september 30 

 

strategic objectives 

 

bd remains focused on delivering sustainable growth and shareholder value while making appropriate investments for the future bd management operates the business consistent with the following core strategies 

 

  

our strategy focuses on four specific areas within healthcare and life sciences 

 

  

we continue to strive to improve the efficiency of our capital structure and follow these guiding principles 

 

  

in assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as bd’s financial condition and operating performance management generally reviews quarterly forecast data monthly actual results segment sales and other similar information we also consider trends related to certain key financial data including gross profit margin selling and administrative expense investment in research and development return on invested capital and cash flows 

financial results 

 

worldwide revenues in 2011 of 78 billion increased 6 from the prior year and reflected volume increases of approximately 4 estimated favorable foreign exchange translation of 3 and estimated price decreases of just under 1 reflecting an ongoing downward trend worldwide revenue growth was also negatively impacted by about 2 percentage points due to an unfavorable comparison to 2010 which included strong sales related to the h1n1 flu pandemic supplemental government spending in japan and economic stimulus research spending in the us we experienced strong international sales of safetyengineered products and strong growth in emerging markets which was offset in part by weaker demand in western europe resulting from austerity measures and lower healthcare utilization sales in the united states of safetyengineered devices grew 1 to 112 billion in 2011 from 111 billion in 2010 international sales of safetyengineered devices grew 21 to 755 million in 2011 from 622 million in 2010 which included an estimated 8 of favorable foreign currency translation international safetyengineered device revenue growth continues to be driven by strong growth in the medical segment with the largest growth in emerging markets including china and latin america 

 

the healthcare industry is facing a challenging economic environment the current economic conditions and other circumstances have resulted in pricing pressures for some of our products and we expect this downward pricing trend to continue through fiscal year 2012 in addition healthcare utilization in the us and western europe remains constrained due to decreases in government and private healthcare spending resulting in less demand for our products and we also expect these conditions to continue into fiscal 2012 we are also experiencing increased raw material costs our anticipated revenue growth over the next three years is expected to come from business growth and expansion among all segments and regions of the world and the development in each business segment of new products and services that provide increased benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers our ability to sustain our longterm growth will depend on a number of factors including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion develop innovative new products with higher gross profit margins across our business segments and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness in addition to the economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere numerous other factors can affect our ability to achieve these goals including without limitation increased competition and healthcare reform initiatives for example the us healthcare reform law contains certain tax provisions that will affect bd the most significant impact is the medical device excise tax which imposes a 23 tax on certain us sales of medical devices beginning in january 2013 sales of bd products that we estimate to be subject to this tax represented about 80 of bd’s total us revenues in fiscal year 2011 

 

our financial position remains strong with cash flows from operating activities totaling 17 billion in 2011 at september 30 2011 we had 16 billion in cash and equivalents and shortterm investments in 2011 cash outflows relating to acquisitions included the purchase of carmel pharma ab “carmel pharma” a swedish company that manufactures the bd phaseal ® system a closedsystem drug transfer device for the safe handling of hazardous drugs that are packaged in vials for 287 million net of cash acquired cash outflows in 2011 also reflected the acquisition of accuri cytometers inc “accuri” a company that develops and manufactures personal flow cytometers for researchers for 205 million net of cash acquired capital expenditures were 515 million in 2011 as we continue to invest in capacity across our segments to support future growth bd’s strong cash flow generation also provided the flexibility to continue to return value to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends during 2011 we repurchased 184 million shares of common stock for 15 billion and paid cash dividends to our shareholders totaling 361 million in november 2011 we issued 500 million of 5year 175 notes and 1 billion of 10year 3125 notes as discussed further below 

 

we face currency exposure each reporting period that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period from time to time we purchase forward contracts and options to partially protect against adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on our derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows in fiscal year 2011 or 2012 the favorable impact of 

foreign currency on revenues for 2011 reflected favorable foreign currency translation and a favorable comparison resulting from hedge losses recognized in 2010 for further discussion refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

 

results of continuing operations 

 

comparisons of income from continuing operations between 2011 and 2010 are affected by the following items that are reflected in our financial results 

 

  

in addition our 2011 results were unfavorably impacted by the effects of the earthquake and tsunami in japan that occurred earlier in the year for the total fiscal year 2011 these events had an estimated unfavorable impact of about 15 million on revenues and approximately 005 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

 

medical segment 

 

medical revenues in 2011 of 40 billion increased 211 million or 56 over 2010 which reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 33 

 

the following is a summary of medical revenues by organizational unit 

 

 

 

 

  

revenue growth in the medical segment reflected strong growth of pharmaceutical systems and international safetyengineered product sales revenues of safetyengineered products increased 334 internationally which included an estimated favorable foreign exchange impact of 97 revenue growth in the pharmaceutical systems unit was driven by doubledigit growth in the united states japan and latin america us revenue growth in the pharmaceutical systems unit in 2011 was aided by strong sales to companies producing certain generic heparin products revenue growth in the diabetes care unit resulted primarily from continued strong growth in worldwide pen needle sales medical revenues in 2011 also reflected an unfavorable comparison to the prioryear period that included strong sales related to the h1n1 flu pandemic primarily in the first half of the year we estimate that this unfavorable comparison negatively impacted medical’s revenue growth rate by approximately 22 percentage points 

 

medical operating income in 2011 was 12 billion or 295 of medical revenues as compared with 11 billion or 295 of revenues in 2010 gross profit margin was higher in the current year than 2010 due to increased sales of products with relatively high gross margins as well as continued manufacturing productivity and lower manufacturing startup costs these favorable impacts on gross profit margin were partially offset by increases in certain raw material costs and higher pension costs allocated to the segment see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of 

medical revenues in 2011 increased to 175 of revenues from 173 of revenues in 2010 primarily due to the acquisition of carmel pharma and unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offset by continued spending controls research and development expenses in 2011 increased 17 million or 13 and reflected continued investment in the development of new products and platforms including new infusion therapy products and new pen needle introductions 

 

diagnostics segment 

 

diagnostics revenues in 2011 of 25 billion increased 161 million or 70 over 2010 which reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 31 

 

the following is a summary of diagnostics revenues by organizational unit 

 

 

 

 

  

revenue growth in the preanalytical systems unit was driven by sales of safetyengineered products sales of safetyengineered products grew 3 in the united states driven by bd vacutainer tm push button blood collection set sales and 15 internationally which included an estimated favorable foreign exchange impact of 7 the diagnostic systems unit experienced growth in worldwide sales of its automated diagnostic platforms including the molecular bd probetec tm  bd viper tm and bd affirm tm systems along with solid growth of its bd bactec tm blood culture and tb systems and the bd phoenix tm idast platform and its healthcareassociated infections “hai” product offerings diagnostics revenues in 2011 also reflected an unfavorable comparison to the prioryear period that included strong sales related to the flu pandemic in 2010 we estimate that this unfavorable comparison negatively impacted diagnostics’ revenue growth rate by approximately 06 percentage points 

 

diagnostics operating income in 2011 was 636 million or 257 of diagnostics revenues compared with 607 million or 262 of revenues in 2010 gross profit margin in the diagnostics segment was relatively flat as compared to the prior year and reflected favorable foreign currency translation offset by higher raw material costs primarily resin see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of diagnostics revenues increased by 30 basis points in 2011 to 215 primarily due to investments in emerging markets and unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offset by continued spending controls research and development expense increased 13 million or 9 over 2010 and reflected continued investment in the development of new products and platforms including the bd max tm and new bd viper tm platforms and menus 

 

biosciences segment 

 

biosciences revenues in 2011 of 13 billion increased 84 million or 67 over 2010 which reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 35 

the following is a summary of biosciences revenues by organizational unit 

 

 

 

biosciences revenue growth was primarily driven by instrument and reagent sales in the cell analysis unit the segment’s overall revenue growth was affected by slower growth in sales of discovery labware products in the us revenue growth in 2011 was also negatively impacted by approximately 36 percentage points due to an unfavorable comparison to 2010 which included strong sales from us stimulus spending and supplemental spending in japan 

 

biosciences operating income in 2011 was 376 million or 281 of biosciences revenues compared with 354 million or 282 in 2010 the segment’s operating income in 2011 reflected a higher gross profit margin than 2010 primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and higher margins on service revenue these favorable variances from the prior year were partially offset by amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition of accuri and increases in certain raw material costs see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense was 221 in 2011 as compared with 219 in 2010 and reflected unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offset by continued spending controls research and development spending increased 11 million or 12 and reflected spending on new products and platforms including the bd facs verse tm analyzer and other next generation cell sorters and analyzers 

 

geographic revenues 

 

revenues in the united states in 2011 of 34 billion increased 2 us revenue growth was negatively impacted by approximately 24 percentage points due to an unfavorable comparison to 2010 which included strong sales related to the flu pandemic and stimulus spending the medical segment experienced strong sales of pharmaceutical systems products in the us diagnostics revenue growth was driven by solid growth in infectious disease and molecular diagnostic platforms revenue growth in the biosciences segment was driven by the cell analysis unit partially offset by lower sales growth of discovery labware products 

 

international revenues in 2011 of 45 billion increased 95 which reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 59 overall international growth was driven by sales in emerging markets with especially strong performance in asia pacific and latin america which was partially offset by slower growth in western europe international revenue growth was negatively impacted by about 15 percentage points due to an unfavorable comparison to 2010 which included strong sales related to the h1n1 flu pandemic and supplemental spending in japan revenue growth in the medical segment was driven by strong sales of safetyengineered products diagnostic revenue growth reflected solid growth of women’s health and cancer products within the diagnostic systems unit as governments are expanding programs for cervical cancer screening in developing markets biosciences revenue growth was driven by the cell analysis unit’s instrument and reagent sales primarily in emerging markets 

 

gross profit margin 

 

gross profit margin was 523 in 2011 compared with 519 in 2010 gross profit margin in 2011 reflected estimated favorable impacts of 20 basis points relating to foreign currency translation and 30 basis points relating to operating performance the favorable impact from operating performance resulted from increased sales of products with relatively higher gross margins increased productivity and lower manufacturing startup costs which were partially offset by increases in resin and other raw material costs and higher 

pension costs gross profit margin in 2011 was also unfavorably impacted by 10 basis points as a result of the amortization of intangibles associated with the accuri acquisition 

 

operating expenses 

 

selling and administrative expense in 2011 of 19 billion or 237 of revenues increased 130 million or 8 compared with 17 billion or 233 of revenues in 2010 aggregate expenses reflected 46 million of unfavorable foreign exchange and increases in core spending of 53 million reflecting funding to expand our business in emerging markets and higher shipping costs aggregate expenses also reflected a 6 million charge to bad debt expense related to european receivables increased pension costs of 13 million and higher acquisitionrelated expenses of 6 million aggregate expenses for the year also included increased spending of 14 million related to our global enterprise resource planning initiative to update our business information systems these increases were partially offset by a 7 million decrease in the deferred compensation plan liability as further discussed below 

 

research and development “rd” expense in 2011 was 476 million or 61 of revenues compared with 431 million or 58 of revenues in 2010 the increase in rd expenditures includes spending for new products and platforms in each of our segments as previously discussed rd expense also included a noncash impairment charge of 9 million in 2011 resulting from the discontinuance of a research program within the diagnostic systems unit 

 

nonoperating expense and income 

 

interest expense in 2011 was 84 million compared with 51 million in 2010 this increase reflected higher levels of longterm fixed rate debt partially offset by lower average interest rates on the overall longterm debt portfolio interest income was 43 million in 2011 compared with 35 million in 2010 this increase resulted from higher interest rates and levels of investments outside the united states net of investment losses on assets related to our deferred compensation plan the related decrease in the deferred compensation plan liability was recorded as a decrease in selling and administrative expenses

the effective tax rate in 2011 of 263 was lower compared with the 2010 rate of 292 and reflected a favorable impact of 13 percentage points due to certain tax benefits these benefits resulted from the retroactive extension of the us research tax credit as well as a european restructuring transaction in addition the 2010 rate was unfavorably impacted by 06 percentage points from the expiration of the rd tax credit and by 05 percentage points from the noncash charge related to healthcare reform impacting medicare part d reimbursements 

 

income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

 

income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 were 13 billion and 559 respectively the charge related to the discontinuance of a research program decreased income from continuing operations in 2011 by 9 million or 003 per share 2011 earnings also reflected an overall net favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of 028 per share income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2010 were 12 billion and 490 respectively the charge related to healthcare reform decreased income from continuing operations in 2010 by 9 million or 004 per share 

 

financial instrument market risk 

 

we selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations the counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign exchange risk 

 

bd and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout europe asia pacific canada japan and latin america we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency these payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions we hedge substantially all such exposures primarily through the use of forward contracts we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations including sales to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period from time to time we purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted sales that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future sales resulting from adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on our derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions 

 

derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value for foreign currency derivatives market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities with respect to the derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2011 a 10 appreciation of the us dollar over a oneyear period would decrease pretax earnings by 23 million while a 10 depreciation of the us dollar would increase pretax earnings by 23 million comparatively considering our derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2010 a 10 appreciation of the us dollar over a oneyear period would have decreased pretax earnings by 30 million while a 10 depreciation of the us dollar would have increased pretax earnings by 30 million these calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates our debt and interestbearing investments at september 30 2011 are substantially all us dollardenominated therefore transaction and translation exposure relating to such instruments is minimal when managing interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments we may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interestbearing investments in tandem since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure for interest rate derivative instruments fair values are provided by the financial institutions that are counterparties to these arrangements market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities a change in interest rates on shortterm debt and interestbearing investments impacts our earnings and cash flow but not the fair value of these instruments because of their limited duration a change in interest rates on longterm debt is assumed to impact the fair value of the debt but not our earnings or cash flow because the interest on such obligations is fixed based on our overall interest rate exposure at september 30 2011 and 2010 a change of 10 in interest rates would not have a material effect on our earnings or cash flows over a oneyear period an increase of 10 in interest rates would decrease the aggregate fair value of our longterm debt and related fair value hedges at september 30 2011 and 2010 by approximately 90 million and 56 million respectively a 10 decrease in interest rates would increase the aggregate fair value of these same financial instruments at september 30 2011 and 2010 by approximately 96 million and 59 million respectively 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

net cash flows from continuing operating activities 

 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2011 was 17 billion unchanged from 2010 the change in operating assets and liabilities resulted from a net use of cash and primarily reflected higher levels of inventory and prepaid expenses net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2010 was reduced 

by discretionary cash contributions to the us pension plan of 175 million an additional discretionary cash contribution of 100 million was made to the us pension plan in october 2011 

 

net cash flows from continuing investing activities 

 

capital expenditures 

 

our investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities and support our strategy of geographic expansion with select investments in growing markets capital expenditures were 515 million in 2011 compared with 537 million in 2010 capital spending for the medical diagnostics and biosciences segments in 2011 was 367 million 93 million and 37 million respectively and related primarily to manufacturing capacity expansions 

 

acquisitions of businesses 

 

cash outflows relating to acquisitions of 492 million in 2011 were comprised of 287 million associated with the acquisition of carmel pharma and 205 million associated with the acquisition of accuri for further discussion refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

 

net cash flows from continuing financing activities 

 

debt issuances and payments of obligations 

 

on november 8 2010 we issued 700 million of 10year 325 notes and 300 million of 30year 500 notes shortterm debt decreased to 9 of total debt at the end of 2011 from 12 at the end of 2010 floating rate debt was 16 of total debt at the end of 2011 and 24 at the end of 2010 our weighted average cost of total debt at the end of 2011 was 49 up from 46 at the end of 2010 debttocapitalization ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt shareholders’ equity and net noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities at september 30 2011 was 358 compared with 237 at september 30 2010 

 

on november 3 2011 we issued 500 million of 5year 175 notes and 1 billion of 10year 3125 notes the net proceeds from these issuances are expected to be used for repurchases of our common stock and other general corporate purposes which may include funding for working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions 

 

repurchase of common stock 

 

we repurchased approximately 184 million shares of our common stock for 15 billion in 2011 and 101 million shares for 750 million in 2010 in july 2011 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 18 million of our common shares when combined with the remaining shares under the september 2010 board of directors’ repurchase authorization a total of approximately 28 million common shares remain available for purchase at september 30 2011 we plan on share repurchases of 15 billion in 2012 subject to market conditions such repurchases are expected to be funded primarily by the newlyissued debt in november 2011 as discussed further above 

 

cash and shortterm investments 

 

at september 30 2011 total worldwide cash and shortterm investments were 156 billion of which 134 billion was held in jurisdictions outside of the united states we regularly review the amount of cash and shortterm investments held outside the united states and currently intend to use most of such amounts to fund our international operations and their growth initiatives however if these amounts were moved out of these jurisdictions or repatriated to the united states there could be tax consequences 

government receivables 

 

accounts receivable balances include sales to governmentowned or governmentsupported healthcare facilities because these customers are governmentowned or supported we could be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or by defaults in these countries 

 

we continually evaluate all government receivables particularly in spain italy and other parts of western europe for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices we believe the current reserves related to government receivables are adequate and this concentration of credit risk is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity 

 

credit facilities 

 

we have in place a commercial paper borrowing program that is available to meet our shortterm financing needs including working capital requirements borrowings outstanding under this program were 200 million at september 30 2011 we maintain a 1 billion syndicated credit facility in order to provide backup support for our commercial paper program and for other general corporate purposes this credit facility expires in december 2012 and includes a single financial covenant that requires bd to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio ratio of earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 5to1 for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters on the last eight measurement dates this ratio had ranged from 19to1 to 29to1 there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at september 30 2011 in addition we have informal lines of credit outside the united states 

 

access to capital and credit ratings 

 

our ability to generate cash flow from operations issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms could be adversely affected in the event there was a material decline in the demand for our products deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions 

 

bd’s credit ratings at september 30 2011 were as follows 

 

 

 

upon review of our plans for the november 2011 debt issuance standard  poor’s lowered bd’s senior unsecured debt rating to a and its commercial paper rating to a1 while affirming a rating outlook for bd of “stable” at the same time moody’s affirmed its senior unsecured debt rating of a2 and commercial paper rating of p1 but lowered its rating outlook for bd to “negative” 

 

while further deterioration in our credit ratings would increase the costs associated with maintaining and borrowing under its existing credit arrangements such a downgrade would not affect our ability to draw on these credit facilities nor would it result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any outstanding debt we believe that given our debt ratings our conservative financial management policies our ability to generate cash flow and the noncyclical geographically diversified nature of our businesses we would have access to additional shortterm and longterm capital should the need arise 

contractual obligations 

 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future the table below sets forth bd’s significant contractual obligations and related scheduled payments 

 

 

 

 

  

2010 compared with 2009 

 

results of continuing operations 

 

worldwide revenues in 2010 of 74 billion increased 55 from the prior year and reflected volume increases of approximately 6 unfavorable foreign exchange translation of 01 inclusive of hedge losses and price decreases of 04 the increase is attributable to solid revenue growth in the medical segment continued improvement in biosciences sales and to a lesser extent growth in diagnostics segment revenues 

 

comparisons of income from continuing operations between 2010 and 2009 are affected by the following significant items that are reflected in our 2010 financial results 

 

  

medical segment 

 

medical revenues in 2010 of 38 billion increased 239 million or 67 over 2009 which reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 05 net of hedge losses 

the following is a summary of medical revenues by organizational unit 

 

 

 

 

  

revenue growth in the medical surgical systems unit continues to be driven by sales of safetyengineered products and prefilled flush syringes revenues of safetyengineered products increased 5 in the united states and 15 internationally which included an estimated favorable foreign exchange impact of 3 net of hedge losses revenue growth in the diabetes care unit resulted primarily from continued strong growth in worldwide pen needle sales and a comarketing agreement in the united states revenue growth in the pharmaceutical systems unit was driven by doubledigit growth in the united states japan and asia pacific revenues related to the h1n1 pandemic grew 15 million to 45 million for the medical surgical systems unit and grew 10 million to 35 million for the pharmaceutical systems unit in 2010 

 

medical operating income in 2010 was 11 billion or 295 of medical revenues as compared with 10 billion or 295 of revenues in 2009 favorable manufacturing productivity improvements were substantially offset by a slight decrease in gross profit margin resulting from unfavorable foreign currency translation a modest increase in the cost of raw materials and increased manufacturing startup and restructuring costs see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of medical revenues in 2010 declined to 173 of revenues from 175 of revenues in 2009 primarily due to continued diligent spending controls research and development expenses in 2010 increased 8 million or 7 and reflected continued investment in the development of new products and platforms 

 

diagnostics segment 

 

diagnostics revenues in 2010 of 23 billion increased 93 million or 42 over 2009 which reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 02 net of hedge losses 

 

the following is a summary of diagnostics revenues by organizational unit 

 

 

 

revenue growth in the preanalytical systems unit was driven by sales of safetyengineered products sales of safetyengineered products grew 5 in the united states driven by bd vacutainer tm push button blood collection set sales and 7 internationally which included an estimated favorable foreign exchange impact of 1 net of hedge losses the diagnostic systems unit experienced growth in worldwide sales of its automated diagnostic platforms including the molecular bd probetec tm  bd viper tm and bd affirm tm systems along with solid growth of its bd bactec tm blood culture and tb systems and the bd phoenix tm idast platform revenues related to the flu pandemic were 13 million in 2010 compared with 22 million in 2009 for the diagnostic systems unit 

diagnostics operating income in 2010 was 607 million or 262 of diagnostics revenues compared with 607 million or 273 of revenues in 2009 the diagnostics segment experienced a decline in gross profit margin that reflected unfavorable foreign currency translation and startup costs associated with acquisitions this decline was partially offset by sales growth of products that have higher overall gross profit margins in particular safetyengineered products and the bd probetec tm and bd viper tm systems see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of diagnostics revenues remained the same in 2010 at 212 due to continued spending controls research and development expense increased modestly over 2009 and reflected continued investment in the development of new products and platforms with particular emphasis on our molecular platforms 

 

biosciences segment 

 

biosciences revenues in 2010 of 13 billion increased 53 million or 44 over 2009 which reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 24 due to hedge losses biosciences revenues reflected a larger portion of our hedge losses which are allocated to the segments based on their proportionate share of international sales of usproduced products 

 

the following is a summary of biosciences revenues by organizational unit 

 

 

 

revenue growth in the cell analysis unit reflected increased demand for instruments and reagents and was aided by stimulus programs in the us as well as supplemental funding in japan revenue growth in the discovery labware unit reflected increased sales to major biopharmaceutical customers offset by reduced private label sales compared with 2009 

 

biosciences operating income in 2010 was 354 million or 282 of biosciences revenues compared with 362 million or 301 in 2009 the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues reflects lower gross profit from the unfavorable impact of hedge losses partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation selling and administrative expense was 219 in 2010 as compared with 216 in 2009 and reflected new direct selling programs and inflationary factors research and development expense increased 10 million or 11 and reflected spending on new product development and advanced technology 

 

geographic revenues 

 

revenues in the united states in 2010 of 33 billion increased 5 overall growth was led by sales of safetyengineered products which increased 5 to 111 billion from 106 billion in 2009 as well as sales of diabetes care products revenue growth also reflected sales of immunocytometry instruments and reagents aided by stimulus programs in the us 

 

international revenues in 2010 of 41 billion increased 6 and reflected nominal impact from net foreign currency translation sales growth was led by doubledigit growth in asia pacific latin america and japan international sales of safetyengineered devices grew 95 to 622 million in 2010 from 568 million in 2009 which included an estimated impact of net favorable foreign currency translation of 14 sales growth in western europe was unfavorably impacted by continuing adverse macroeconomic conditions and an unfavorable comparison to 2009 which included flurelated sales that did not reoccur in 2010 

gross profit margin 

 

gross profit margin was 519 in 2010 compared with 526 in 2009 gross profit margin in 2010 reflected an estimated unfavorable impact primarily from hedging activity of 90 basis points partially offsetting these losses was a net favorable operating performance impact of 20 basis points operating performance reflected higher sales of products with higher gross margins partially offset by higher manufacturing startup and restructuring costs higher pension costs and increases in certain raw material costs 

 

operating expenses 

 

selling and administrative expense in 2010 of 17 billion or 233 of revenues increased 41 million or 2 compared with 17 billion or 241 of revenues in 2009 this increase reflected 32 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation increased spending in 2010 included 18 million in core spending 16 million related to our global enterprise resource planning initiative to update our business information systems and 15 million in pension costs aggregate expenses for 2009 reflected the 45 million litigation charge previously discussed

nonoperating expense and income 

 

interest expense in 2010 was 51 million compared with 40 million in 2009 this increase reflected higher levels of longterm fixed rate debt partially offset by lower interest rates on floating rate debt and a benefit from higher levels of capitalized interest interest income was 35 million in 2010 compared with 33 million in 2009 this increase resulted primarily from higher investment levels other income expense net in 2010 included the gain recognized on the sale of the extended dwell catheter product platform of 18 million and a writedown of investments of 14 million 

 

income taxes 

 

the effective tax rate in 2010 of 292 was higher compared with the 2009 rate of 261 and reflected the unfavorable impact of certain unusual items the 2010 rate was unfavorably impacted by 06 percentage points from the expiration of the rd tax credit and by 05 percentage points from the noncash charge related to healthcare reform impacting medicare part d reimbursements in addition the 2009 rate reflected a 12 percentage point benefit due to various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions 

 

income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

 

income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2010 were 12 billion and 490 respectively the noncash charge related to healthcare reform decreased income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2010 by 9 million or 4 cents respectively the current year’s earnings also reflected an overall net unfavorable impact of foreign exchange fluctuations of 26 cents including hedge losses income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 were 12 million and 473 respectively the tax benefit discussed above increased income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 by 20 million or 8 cents respectively the litigation charge discussed above decreased income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 by 28 million or 11 cents respectively 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

net cash flows from continuing operating activities 

 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2010 was 17 billion unchanged from 2009 the change in operating assets and liabilities resulted from a net use of cash and reflected higher levels of accounts 

receivable and inventory net cash provided by continuing operating activities was reduced by discretionary cash contributions to the us pension plan of 175 million and 75 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

net cash flows from continuing investing activities 

 

capital expenditures were 537 million in 2010 compared with 585 million in 2009 capital spending for the medical diagnostics and biosciences segments in 2010 was 369 million 109 million and 50 million respectively and related primarily to manufacturing capacity expansions 

 

cash outflows relating to acquisitions of 281 million in 2010 primarily related to a cash outflow of 275 million associated with the acquisition of handylab inc for further discussion refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

 

on july 30 2010 the company sold the ophthalmic systems unit and the surgical blades platform the sale of the critical care and extended dwell catheter product platforms was completed on september 30 2010 cash proceeds received in the fourth quarter 2010 from these divestitures were 260 million net of working capital adjustments for further discussion refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

 

net cash flows from continuing financing activities 

 

the change in shortterm debt reflected the repayment of 200 million of 715 notes due october 1 2009 using the proceeds from the issuance of 500 million of 10year 500 notes and 250 million of 30year 600 notes in may 2009 shortterm debt decreased to 12 of total debt at the end of 2010 from 21 at the end of 2009 floating rate debt was 24 of total debt at the end of 2010 and 32 at the end of 2009 our weighted average cost of total debt at the end of 2010 was 46 down from 49 at the end of 2009 debttocapitalization ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt shareholders’ equity and net noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities at september 30 2010 was 237 compared to 268 at september 30 2009 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

revenue from product sales is typically recognized when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered product price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

 

for certain instruments sold from the biosciences segment we recognize revenue upon installation at a customer’s site as installation of these instruments is considered a significant postdelivery obligation for certain sales arrangements primarily in the us with multiple deliverables revenue and cost of products sold are recognized at the completion of each deliverable shipment installation and training these sales agreements are divided into separate units of accounting and revenue is recognized upon the completion of 

each deliverable based on its relative selling price the relative selling prices of installation and training are determined based on the prices at which these deliverables would be regularly sold on a standalone basis the relative selling prices of instruments are based on estimated selling prices these estimates represent the quoted sales contract price in each arrangement 

 

bd’s domestic businesses sell products primarily to distributors who resell the products to enduser customers we provide rebates to distributors that sell to enduser customers at prices determined under a contract between bd and the enduser customer provisions for rebates which are based on historical information for all rebates that have not yet been processed as well as sales discounts and returns are accounted for as a reduction of revenues when revenue is recognized 

 

impairment of assets 

 

goodwill and inprocess research and development assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment arise intangible assets with finite lives including core and developed technology and other longlived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present 

 

we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units generally represent one level below reporting segments and we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2011 annual impairment assessment we identified six reporting units potential impairment of goodwill is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value our annual goodwill impairment test for 2011 did not result in any impairment charges as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

 

we generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with bd’s business plans the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and potentially result in different impacts to bd’s results of operations actual results may differ from management’s estimates 

 

income taxes 

 

bd maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 

 

bd conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions our past audit experience with similar situations and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters bd’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if upon resolution with taxing authorities we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 

 

deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested at september 30 2011 the cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the united states was 38 billion the determination of the amount of the unrecognized 

deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation 

 

contingencies 

 

we are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including without limitation product liability antitrust and environmental matters as further discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses we establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries a determination of the amount of accruals if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue and when appropriate is developed after consultation with outside counsel the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters 

 

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance accordingly in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows 

 

benefit plans 

 

we have significant net pension and other postretirement benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate and expected return on plan assets other postretirement benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rates these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

 

the discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date september 30 for the us pension plan we will use a discount rate of 49 for 2012 which was based on an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve the rate selected is used to measure liabilities as of the measurement date and for calculating the following year’s pension expense the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption although reviewed each year changes less frequently due to the longterm nature of the assumption this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date rather it is used only in the calculation of pension expense to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider many factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results benchmark data expected returns on various plan asset classes as well as current and expected asset allocations we will use a longterm expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 775 for the us pension plan in 2012 we believe our discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 

 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our us pension and other postretirement plans are as follows 

 

 34 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

compensation cost relating to sharebased payment transactions is recognized in net income using a fair value measurement method all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options are recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense based on their fair values over the vesting period of the awards we determine the fair value of certain sharebased awards using a latticebased binomial option valuation model that incorporates certain assumptions such as the riskfree interest rate expected volatility expected dividend yield and expected life of the options see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion 

 

cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

 

bd and its representatives may from time to time make certain forwardlooking statements in publicly released materials both written and oral including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission press releases and our reports to shareholders forwardlooking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan” “expect” “believe” “intend” “will” “anticipate” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with among other things discussions of future operations and financial performance as well as our strategy for growth product development regulatory approvals market position and expenditures all statements that address operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to volume growth sales and earnings per share growth cash flows or uses and statements expressing views about future operating results — are forwardlooking statements 

 

forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations of future events the forwardlooking statements are and will be based on management’s thencurrent views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of their dates investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements furthermore we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information future events and developments or otherwise except as required by applicable law or regulations 

 

the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements for further discussion of certain of these factors see item 1a risk factors 

 

 35 

  

 36 

 

  

the foregoing list sets forth many but not all of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forwardlooking statements investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties

international operations 

bd’s products are manufactured and sold worldwide for reporting purposes we organize our operations outside the us as follows europe which includes the middle east and africa japan asia pacific which includes australia and all of asia except japan latin america which includes mexico and brazil and canada the principal products sold by bd outside of the us are needles and syringes insulin syringes and pen needles diagnostic systems bd vacutainer tm brand blood collection products bd hypak tm brand prefillable syringe systems infusion therapy products flow cytometry instruments and reagents and disposable laboratory products bd has manufacturing operations in brazil canada china france germany india ireland japan mexico pakistan singapore south korea spain sweden and the united kingdom geographic information with respect to bd’s operations is included under the heading “geographic information” in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and is incorporated herein by reference

foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues bd believes its activities in some countries outside the us involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein as well as the economic environment local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties see further discussion of this risk in item 1a risk factors

distribution 

bd’s products are marketed in the us and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to endusers by bd and independent sales representatives no customer accounted for 10 or more of revenues in fiscal year 2009 order backlog is not material to bd’s business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock bd’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the bd medical segment and respiratory and flu diagnostic products in the bd diagnostics segment that relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza

raw materials 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment are not available from multiple sources in the case of certain principal raw materials that are available from multiple sources for various reasons including quality assurance and cost effectiveness bd elects to purchase these raw materials from sole suppliers in cases where there are regulatory requirements relating to qualification of suppliers bd may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis while bd works closely with its suppliers to ensure continuity of supply the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products

research and development 

bd conducts its research and development activities at its operating units and at bd technologies in research triangle park north carolina substantially all of bd’s research and development activities are conducted in the us bd also collaborates with certain universities medical centers and other entities on research and development programs and retains individual consultants to support its efforts in specialized fields bd spent approximately 408 million 396 million and 359 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in addition bd incurred acquired inprocess research and development charges of 122 million related to the acquisitions of tripath imaging inc and plasso technology ltd in fiscal year 2007

intellectual property and licenses 

bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the us and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bd’s business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bd’s business as a whole or to any business segment

competition 

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace whose dynamics are changing technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology and regulation of increasingly more sophisticated and complex medical products is increasing companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and

instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among other companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment in addition the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations are creating increased pricing pressures particularly in developing markets some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs new entrants may also appear particularly from these lowcost countries 

bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to implement one of its core strategies – to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers – and maintain an advantage in the competitive environment in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement

thirdparty reimbursement 

healthcare providers andor facilities are generally reimbursed for their services through numerous payment systems maintained by governmental agencies eg medicare and medicaid in the us the national health service in the uk the joint federal committee in germany the commission d’evaluation des produits et prestations in france and the ministry for health labor and welfare in japan private insurance companies and managed care organizations the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case typically depends on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at the payer’s discretion the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products thus changes in reimbursement level or method may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products while bd is actively engaged in promoting the value of its products for payers and patients and it employs various efforts and resources to positively impact coverage coding and payment processes in this regard it has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and the payment level for bd products additionally we expect many payers to continue to explore costcontainment strategies eg comparative effectiveness analyses socalled “payforperformance” programs implemented by various public and private payers and expansion of payment bundling schemes that could potentially impact coverage andor payment levels for current or future bd products

as bd’s product offerings are diverse across many healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment systems therefore individual countries product lines or product classes may be impacted by changes to these systems notably healthcare reform that is currently under consideration in the us congress could substantially change the health insurance system in this country as yet it is unclear whether or how this might affect payment for bd products

regulation 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing

prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews of bd’s manufacturing processes product performance and advertising and promotional materials these regulatory controls can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes

these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls on may 11 2009 bd received a warning letter from the fda citing concerns that a communication posted on bd’s website contained some language that the fda believed could be interpreted as promoting the use of the bd ä ez flu ab test to diagnose patients that were suspected of having the 2009 variant of the h1n1 flu virus in response bd immediately removed the information from its website and implemented a series of comprehensive corrective and preventive actions around promotional activities bd subsequently held a followup meeting with the fda in july 2009 during which the fda indicated it was satisfied with bd’s response to date

bd believes it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable law and the regulations promulgated by such agencies including a without limitation environmental laws and regulations and that such compliance has not had and will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or results see item 3 legal proceedings

employees 

as of september 30 2009 bd had 29116 employees of whom 12698 were employed in the us including puerto rico bd believes that its employee relations are satisfactory

other matters 

becton dickinson france sa “bdfrance” a subsidiary of bd was listed among approximately 2200 other companies in an october 27 2005 report of the independent inquiry committee “iic” of the united nations “un” as having been involved in humanitarian contracts in which unauthorized payments were suspected of having been made to the iraqi government in connection with the un’s oilforfood programme the “programme” in connection with the iic’s report becton dickinson ag a swiss subsidiary of bd received a letter of inquiry from the vendor review committee “vrc” of the united nations procurement service dated november 22 2005 the letter of inquiry said that the vrc is reviewing becton dickinson ag’s registration status in light of bdfrance being listed in the iic’s report and asked us for any information we might be able to provide relating to the findings of the report bd conducted an internal review and found no evidence that bd or any bd employee made authorized or approved improper payments to the iraqi government in connection with the programme the representative utilized by bd in iraq also unequivocally denied having made any such payments and bd was unable to find any evidence of such payments being made by this representative bd has also reported the results of its internal review to the vrc in may 2008 bd received a letter from the un stating that becton dickinson ag had been suspended from the un secretariat procurement division’s vendor roster for a minimum period of six months we have requested that becton dickinson ag be reinstated bd believes that the suspension has not had and will not have a material adverse effect on bd

in may 2007 the french judicial police conducted searches of bdfrance’s offices in france with respect to the matters that were the subject of the 2005 iic report we were informed that bdfrance is one of a number of companies named in the iic report that is being investigated by the french judicial police in june 2009 the belgian federal police contacted bd to interview certain individuals and review documents related to sales made under the programme we are cooperating fully with these investigations

tablestart 


 item 1a   risk factors tableend 

an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows

current economic conditions could adversely affect our operations 

the global financial crisis has caused extreme disruption in the financial markets including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability while these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets to date there can be no assurance that these conditions will not adversely affect our ability to do so in the future particularly if there is further deterioration in the world financial markets and major economies the current economic conditions may also adversely affect the business of our customers and the amount spent on healthcare generally this could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition during 2009 the global recession weakened the demand for our products in certain areas of our business in particular that of our biosciences segment in the us which was affected by a slowdown in researchrelated capital spending the strength and timing of any economic recovery remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that the economic downturn will not continue to affect our operations in the future

in addition the current economic conditions may adversely affect our suppliers such as resin suppliers that do substantial business with the automotive industry which could cause disruptions in our ability to produce our products for example during fiscal year 2009 lyondell chemical company and certain affiliated entities collectively “lyondell” filed for protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code lyondell supplies bd with medical grade resins used to manufacture products in our bd medical and bd diagnostics segments in addition smurfitstone container corp a supplier of packaging materials also filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 while bd has not experienced any interruption in the supply from any of its suppliers to date there can be no assurances that bd will not experience any interruptions in supply in the future

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

over half of our fiscal year 2009 revenues were derived from international operations our revenues outside the us may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year 2009 worldwide currencies experienced extreme volatility which negatively impacted our reported results a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to address any impact is contained in item 7 management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations our hedging activities may however only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks

proposals to reform the us healthcare system may have a material adverse effect on us 

the us congress is considering legislation to reform the us healthcare system in an effort to contain healthcare costs and increase access although a number of proposals have received varying levels of support in congress there still is no consensus on a number of key issues including coverage mandates and the establishment of a public healthcare insurance option several proposals on how to finance healthcare reform are also being considered certain proposals would impose an excise tax on medical device companies such as bd which could go into effect as early as calendar year 2010 while we cannot predict what healthcare legislation if any will be passed into law such legislation could among other things lower reimbursements for our products reduce the volume of medical procedures or impose additional financial burdens on bd

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the us as part of the healthcare reform being debated or abroad could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using bd medical devices or result in denial of reimbursement for those products see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business

price volatility could adversely affect the results of our operations 

our results of operations could be negatively impacted by price volatility in the cost of raw materials components freight and energy in particular bd purchases supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products any significant increases in resin purchase costs could impact future operating results increases in the price of oil can also increase bd’s costs for packaging and transportation these cost increases may adversely affect our profitability

bd’s future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers the development of these products requires significant research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including bd’s ability to innovate develop and manufacture new products complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad or gain and maintain market approval of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance

the medical technology industry is very competitive 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than us with respect to particular markets other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in addition the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations are creating increased pricing pressures particularly in developing markets some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs new entrants may also appear particularly from these lowcost countries

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect bd’s manufacturing operations and related product sales 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials and components we have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of these materials however certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment and components are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons bd elects to purchase certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers the supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of reasons including current economic conditions as described above while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition where there are regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials and components could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in addition in some instances the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants as a result weather natural disasters including pandemic disease terrorism political change or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products

bd is subject to a number of pending lawsuits 

bd is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits including purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and product liability and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in item 3 legal proceedings given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could adversely affect bd’s results of operations and cash flows

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

the medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals

we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning system 

we have initiated a project to upgrade our enterprise resource planning “erp” system our erp system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records record transactions provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements the design and implementation of the new erp system has required and will continue to require the investment of significant financial and human resources the total cost needed to implement the new erp system may turn out to be more than we currently anticipate in addition we may not be able to successfully implement the new erp system without experiencing difficulties any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business

bd is subject to extensive regulation 

bd is subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of bd’s products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart nonus regulatory agencies before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products in addition regulatory requirements outside the us change frequently requiring prompt action to maintain compliance particularly when product modifications are required

following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting clinical trial and other

requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production marketing or sale of our products and result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances closure of manufacturing sites seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation 

we cannot guarantee that any of bd’s strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

while our strategy to increase revenue growth is driven primarily by internal product development we seek to supplement our growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate it into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful

the international operations of bd’s business may subject bd to certain business risks 

bd operations outside the us subject bd to certain risks including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange as discussed above the spread of a global economic downturn changes in foreign regulatory requirements potential political instability trade barriers weakening of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders the success of our operations outside the us will depend in part on our ability to acquire or form alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and distribution networks

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our bd biosciences segment 

our bd biosciences segment sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and as was experienced in fiscal year 2009 general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and agencies in other countries the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods the availability of governmental research funding may also continue to be adversely affected by the current economic downturn any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property rights 

many of bd’s businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property rights while we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other intellectual property asset would materially adversely affect bd operations these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business bd can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows

natural disasters war and other events could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

natural disasters including pandemics war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts and actions taken by the united states and other governments in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the us and in areas outside of the us in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers recently the world health organization issued its highest pandemic alert relating to the h1n1 flu depending on its severity such a pandemic could adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers

we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 

our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense the company’s ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected

company overview 

becton dickinson and company “bd” is a global medical technology company engaged principally in the development manufacture and sale of medical devices instrument systems and reagents used by healthcare institutions life science researchers clinical laboratories the pharmaceutical industry and the general public our business consists of three worldwide business segments — bd medical “medical” bd diagnostics “diagnostics” and bd biosciences “biosciences” our products are marketed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to endusers by bd and independent sales representatives references to years throughout this discussion relate to our fiscal years which end on september 30

bd management operates the business consistent with the following core strategies

 

our efforts to increase revenues are focused on four specific areas of healthcare

 

in assessing the outcomes of these strategies and bd’s financial condition and operating performance management generally reviews quarterly forecast data monthly actual results segment sales and other similar information we also consider trends related to certain key financial data including gross profit margin selling and administrative expense investment in research and development return on invested capital and cash flows

worldwide revenues in 2009 of 72 billion increased 1 from the prior year and reflected volume increases of approximately 5 and price increases of less than 1 which were partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency translation of 4 after factoring in hedge gains our reported revenues reflect the effect current economic conditions are having on customer demand in certain areas of our business us revenues increased 3 to 32 billion sales in the united states of safetyengineered devices grew 4 to 11 billion in 2009 from 10 billion in 2008 international revenues of 40 billion were relatively flat compared with the prior year and reflected an estimated 7 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency translation net of hedge gains international sales of safetyengineered devices grew 7 to 571 million in 2009 from 534 million in 2008 and reflected an estimated 10 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency translation net of hedge gains

our anticipated revenue growth over the next three years is expected to come from business growth and expansion among all segments and regions of the world and the development in each business segment of new products and services that provide increased benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers our ability to sustain our longterm growth will depend on a number of factors including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion develop innovative new products with higher gross profit margins across our business segments and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness numerous factors can affect our ability to achieve these goals including without limitation economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere increased competition and healthcare reform initiatives specifically there are various healthcare reform proposals in the us congress that if enacted in their current form would impose an excise tax on medical device manufacturers such as bd

we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of the period we purchase forward contracts to partially protect against adverse foreign exchange rate movements gains or losses on our derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions

during 2009 the us dollar strengthened against most foreign currencies primarily the euro compared to rates from 2008 the resulting unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on revenues in 2009 was mitigated to an extent by hedge gains recorded in revenues resulting from our hedging activities for further discussion refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

results of continuing operations 

comparisons of income from continuing operations between 2009 and 2008 are affected by the following significant items that are reflected in our 2009 financial results 

 

 

medical segment 

medical revenues in 2009 of 37 billion increased 11 million or 03 over 2008 as volume growth was mostly offset by an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 5 percentage points net of hedge gains

the following is a summary of revenues by organizational unit

 

on a foreign currencyneutral basis revenue growth of the medical surgical systems unit continues to be driven by sales in safetyengineered products and prefilled flush syringes revenues of safetyengineered products increased 2 in the united states and 13 internationally which included an estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 12 net of hedge gains revenue growth in the diabetes care unit resulted primarily from worldwide pen needle sales revenue growth in the pharmaceutical systems unit was driven by growth in europe and asia pacific offset by lower sales in the united states when compared to 2008 which included nonrecurring sales to companies producing certain generic heparin products revenues related to the h1n1 pandemic were 30 million for the medical surgical systems unit and 25 million for the pharmaceutical systems unit in 2009

medical operating income was 11 billion or 297 of medical revenues in 2009 as compared with 11 billion or 283 of revenues in 2008 operating income as a percentage of revenues reflected an increase in gross profit margin primarily resulting from favorable currency translation including hedge gains and a modest benefit from lower raw materials cost which was partially offset by increased manufacturing startup costs see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of medical revenues in 2009 declined to 173 of revenues from 178 of revenues in 2008 primarily due to tight spending controls research and development expenses in 2009 increased 6 million or 5 reflecting continued investment in the development of new products and platforms

diagnostics segment 

diagnostics revenues in 2009 of 22 billion increased 66 million or 3 over 2008 revenues in 2009 reflected an estimated unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 4 percentage points net of hedge gains

the following is a summary of revenues by organizational unit

 

revenue growth in the preanalytical systems unit was driven by sales of safetyengineered products sales of safetyengineered products grew 6 in the united states driven by bd vacutainer push button blood collection set sales and 4 internationally which included an estimated unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 10 net of hedge gains the diagnostics systems unit experienced growth in worldwide sales of its automated diagnostic platforms including the molecular bd probetec  bd 

viper and bd affirm systems along with solid growth of its bd bactec blood culture and tb systems and the bd phoenix idast platform revenues of flurelated products were 22 million in 2009 in addition revenues from tripath grew 11 million to 130 million and revenues from geneohm grew 9 million to 51 million in 2009 

diagnostics operating income was 607 million or 273 of diagnostics revenues in 2009 compared with 526 million or 243 of revenues in 2008 the diagnostics segment experienced an improvement in gross profit margin from sales growth of products that have higher overall gross profit margins in particular safetyengineered products and the bd probetec and bd viper systems this was partially offset by increases in raw material costs and unfavorable foreign exchange see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of diagnostics revenues in 2009 was 212 compared with 220 in 2008 primarily due to tight spending controls research and development expense increased 10 million or 7 reflecting continued investment in the development of new products and platforms with particular emphasis on our molecular platforms

biosciences segment 

biosciences revenues in 2009 of 12 billion increased 9 million or 1 over 2008 which reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 1 percentage point net of hedge gains

the following is a summary of revenues by organizational unit

 

 

 revenue growth in the cell analysis unit reflected lessening demand for instruments and research reagents caused primarily by adverse economic conditions in the us that resulted in funding constraints and lower demand for capital equipment the unit was also impacted by reduced research spending in other regions revenue growth in the discovery labware unit was adversely impacted by reduced sales to a major bionutrients customer compared with 2008 biosciences revenues reflected a larger portion of our hedge gains which are allocated to the segments based on their proportionate share of international sales of usproduced products

biosciences operating income was 362 million or 301 of biosciences revenues in 2009 compared with 334 million or 279 in 2008 the increase in operating income as a percentage of revenues reflects gross profit improvement from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation including hedge gains see further discussion on gross profit margin below in addition selling and administrative expense as a percentage of biosciences revenues declined in 2009 to 216 from 230 in 2008 primarily due to tight spending controls research and development expense in 2009 was flat compared to 2008

geographic revenues 

revenues in the united states in 2009 of 32 billion increased 3 overall growth was led by sales of safetyengineered products which increased 4 to 11 billion as well as sales of diabetes care products revenue growth was adversely impacted by lower sales of immunocytometry instruments and reagents and pharmaceutical systems products as previously discussed

international revenues in 2009 of 40 billion were relatively flat compared with the prior year as increased sales volume was offset by an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 7 percentage points net of hedge gains volume growth was led by sales in western europe asia pacific and latin america in 2009 international sales of safetyengineered devices grew

7 to 571 million in 2009 from 534 million in 2008 and reflected an estimated 10 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency translation 

gross profit margin 

gross profit margin increased to 526 in 2009 from 513 in 2008 gross profit margin in 2009 reflected an estimated favorable impact of 140 basis points from both foreign currency translation and the hedging of certain foreign currencies and 20 basis points from lower raw materials cost partially offsetting these gains were increases in manufacturing startup costs of approximately 30 basis points

operating expenses 

selling and administrative expense was 17 billion or 238 of revenues in 2009 compared with 17 billion or 240 of revenues in 2008 aggregate expenses reflected the 45 million litigation charge previously discussed and 48 million of increased core spending these increases were partially offset by 84 million of favorable foreign exchange impacts

research and development “rd” expense in 2009 was 408 million or 57 of revenues compared with 396 million or 56 of revenues in 2008 the increase in rd expenditures includes spending for new products and platforms in the medical and diagnostics segments as previously discussed

operating income 

operating margin in 2009 was 230 of revenues compared with 217 in 2008 the litigation charge noted above decreased operating margin in 2009 by 70 basis points

nonoperating expense and income 

interest expense was 40 million in 2009 compared with 36 million in 2008 this increase reflected higher debt levels offset in part by lower interest rates on floating rate debt interest income was 33 million in 2009 compared with 39 million in 2008 this decrease was attributable to the impact of lower interest rates on floating rate investments partially offset by a benefit from investment gains on assets associated with our deferred compensation plan a related increase in the deferred compensation plan liability was recorded as an increase in selling and administrative expenses

income taxes 

the effective tax rate in 2009 was 260 compared with the 2008 rate of 275 and reflected a 12 benefit due to various tax settlements in multiple jurisdictions

discontinued operations 

in july 2009 the company sold certain assets and liabilities related to the elastics and thermometer components of the home healthcare product line of the medical segment for 51 million see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion

income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 were 12 billion and 492 respectively the tax benefit discussed above increased income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 by 20 million or 8 cents respectively the litigation charge discussed above decreased income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 by 28 million or 11 cents respectively income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2008 were 11 million and 442 respectively

financial instrument market risk 

we selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations the counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes

bd and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout europe asia pacific canada japan and latin america we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency these payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions we hedge substantially all such exposures primarily through the use of forward contracts and options we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations specifically sales to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future sales resulting from adverse foreign exchange rate movements we purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted sales that are denominated in foreign currencies gains or losses on our derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions

derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value for foreign currency derivatives market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities with respect to the derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2009 a 10 appreciation of the us dollar over a oneyear period would increase pretax earnings by 85 million while a 10 depreciation of the us dollar would decrease pretax earnings by 85 million comparatively considering our derivative instruments outstanding at september 30 2008 a 10 appreciation of the us dollar over a oneyear period would have increased pretax earnings by 91 million while a 10 depreciation of the us dollar would have decreased pretax earnings by 91 million these calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments

our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm us dollar interest rates our debt and interestbearing investments at september 30 2009 are substantially all us dollardenominated therefore transaction and translation exposure relating to such instruments is minimal when managing interest rate exposures we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments we may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interestbearing investments in tandem since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure for interest rate derivative instruments fair values are provided by the financial institutions that are counterparties to these arrangements market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities a change in interest rates on shortterm debt and interestbearing investments impacts our earnings and cash flow but not the fair value of these instruments because of their limited duration a change in interest rates on longterm debt is assumed to impact the fair value of the debt but not our earnings or cash flow because the interest on such obligations is fixed based on our overall interest rate exposure at september 30 2009 and 2008 a change of 10 in interest rates would not have a material effect on our earnings or cash flows over a oneyear period an increase of 10 in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our longterm debt and interest rate swaps at september 30 2009 and 2008 by approximately 66 million and 35 million respectively a 10 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our longterm debt and interest rate swaps at september 30 2009 and 2008 by approximately 71 million and 39 million respectively

liquidity and capital resources 

cash generated from operations along with available cash and cash equivalents is expected to be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs including capital expenditures cash dividends and common stock repurchases in 2010

net cash flows from continuing operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2009 was 17 billion unchanged from 2008 net income excluding noncash items primarily depreciation amortization sharebased compensation and deferred income taxes was the primary source of operating cash flow during 2009 the change in operating assets and liabilities was a net use of cash and reflected higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory accounts receivable increased primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 particularly in europe inventory levels increased primarily due to a build up of inventory in anticipation of orders relating to the h1n1 pandemic and seasonal flu products

net cash flows from continuing investing activities 

net cash used for continuing investing activities in 2009 was 11 billion compared with 783 million in 2008 capital expenditures were 591 million in 2009 compared with 602 million in 2008 capital spending for the medical diagnostics and biosciences segments was 414 million 102 million and 56 million respectively in 2009 and related primarily to manufacturing

capacity expansions the increase in cash used for purchases of shortterm investments is primarily related to the temporary investment of proceeds from the longterm debt issuance discussed below the increase in cash used for capital software investment is primarily related to our enterprisewide program to upgrade our business information systems 

in november 2009 we acquired 100 of the outstanding shares of handylab inc a company that develops and manufactures molecular diagnostic assays and automation platforms the purchase price was 275 million in cash for further discussion refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

net cash flows from continuing financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 80 million in 2009 as compared with 586 million in 2008 in may 2009 we issued 500 million of 10year 500 notes and 250 million of 30year 600 notes the proceeds of which were used to repay 200 million of 715 notes due october 1 2009 to fund a discretionary pension contribution of 175 million in october 2009 and for other general corporate purposes total debt was 19 billion and 12 billion at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively shortterm debt increased to 21 of total debt at yearend from 17 at the end of 2008 floating rate debt was 32 of total debt at the end of 2009 and 35 at the end of 2008 our weighted average cost of total debt at the end of 2009 was 49 unchanged from the end of 2008 debttocapitalization at yearend increased to 268 compared to 188 last year primarily due to our debt issuance

we have in place a commercial paper borrowing program that is available to meet our shortterm financing needs including working capital requirements borrowings outstanding under this program were 200 million at september 30 2009 we maintain a 1 billion syndicated credit facility in order to provide backup support for our commercial paper program and for other general corporate purposes this credit facility expires in december 2012 and includes a single financial covenant that requires bd to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio ratio of earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 5to1 for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters on the last eight measurement dates this ratio had ranged from 26to1 to 34to1 there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at september 30 2009 in addition we have informal lines of credit outside the united states

at september 30 2009 standard and poor’s rated our longterm debt “aa” and our commercial paper “a1” our moody’s ratings at september 30 2009 were “a2” for longterm debt and “p1” for commercial paper the outlook from both agencies was “stable”

we repurchased shares of our common stock for approximately 550 million in 2009 and 450 million in 2008 at september 30 2009 approximately 76 million common shares remained available for purchase under a november 2008 board of directors’ authorization to repurchase up to 10 million common shares 

bd’s ability to generate cash flow from operations issue debt enter into other financing arrangements and attract longterm capital on acceptable terms could be adversely affected in the event there was a material decline in the demand for bd’s products deterioration in bd’s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions while a deterioration in the company’s credit ratings would increase the costs associated with maintaining and borrowing under its existing credit arrangements such a downgrade would not affect the company’s ability to draw on these credit facilities nor would it result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any outstanding debt bd believes that given its debt ratings its conservative financial management policies its ability to generate cash flow and the noncyclical geographically diversified nature of its businesses the company would have access to additional shortterm and longterm capital should the need arise

contractual obligations 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future the table below sets forth bd’s significant contractual obligations and related scheduled payments

 

 

 2008 compared with 2007

medical revenues reflected the growth of the pharmaceutical systems and diabetes care units primarily outside of the united states and the continued global conversion to safetyengineered products the pharmaceutical systems unit grew by 19 driven by growth in europe and asiapacific offset by lower growth in the united states when compared to fiscal 2007 which

reflected very high growth to support customer product launches revenue growth in the diabetes care unit of 12 was driven primarily by doubledigit growth in all regions outside of the united states revenue in the medical surgical systems unit was primarily driven by growth in safetyengineered products and prefilled flush syringes sales of safetyengineered products increased 3 in the united states and 38 internationally 

medical operating income was 11 billion or 283 of medical revenues in 2008 as compared with 10 billion or 285 of revenues in 2007 operating income as a percentage of revenues reflects declines in gross margin from increased costs of raw materials inventory writeoffs and declines in sales of products that have higher overall gross profit margins these items more than offset favorable manufacturing efficiencies and controls on selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expense as a percentage of medical revenues in 2008 declined to 178 of revenues from 187 of revenues in 2007 primarily due to tight spending controls research and development expenses in 2008 increased 80 million or 7 reflecting continued investment in the development of new products and platforms

diagnostics operating income was 526 million or 243 of diagnostics revenues in 2008 compared with 343 million or 180 of revenues in 2007 segment operating income reflects the inprocess research and development charges of 115 million in 2007 related to the tripath acquisition the diagnostics segment experienced a slight improvement in gross profit margin from sales growth of products that have higher overall gross profit margins in particular safetyengineered products and the bd probetec and bd viper systems and favorable foreign exchange these improvements were slightly offset by manufacturing startup costs and increases in raw material costs see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of diagnostics revenues in 2008 was 220 compared with 224 in 2007 primarily due to tight spending controls research and development expense increased 16 million or 14 reflecting continued investment in the development of new products and platforms with particular emphasis on our molecular platforms

biosciences segment 

biosciences revenues in 2008 of 12 billion increased 161 million or 16 over 2007 which reflected an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 6 percentage points

the following is a summary of revenues by organizational unit

 

 

 revenue growth in the cell analysis unit reflected strong sales of instruments and flow cytometry reagents driven by increased demand for research instruments and clinical reagents revenue growth in the discovery labware unit reflected reduced sales to a major bionutrients customer compared with 2007

biosciences operating income was 334 million or 279 of biosciences revenues in 2008 compared with 259 million or 250 in 2007 segment operating income in 2007 included an inprocess research and development charge of 7 million relating to the plasso acquisition the increase in operating income as a percentage of revenues reflects gross profit improvement from relatively higher sales growth of products that have higher overall gross profit margins and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation see further discussion on gross profit margin below selling and administrative expense as a percentage of biosciences revenues in 2008 was 230 as compared with 240 in 2007 primarily due to tight spending controls research and development expense in 2008 increased 11 million or 15 reflecting spending on new product development and advanced technology

geographic revenues 

revenues in the united states in 2008 of 31 billion increased 5 us sales of safetyengineered devices grew 5 to 1036 billion in 2008 overall growth was also led by increased sales of immunocytometry instruments and reagents diabetes care products and infectious disease testing systems

international revenues in 2008 increased 19 to 40 billion reflecting an estimated impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 11 percentage points volume growth was led by solid sales in europe and certain asia pacific countries in 2008 international sales of safetyengineered devices were approximately 534 million in 2008 compared with 414 million in 2007

gross profit margin 

gross profit margin decreased to 513 in 2008 from 517 in 2007 gross profit margin in 2008 as compared with 2007 reflected an estimated 07 unfavorable impact resulting from increased costs of raw materials primarily resins and manufacturing startup costs and an estimated 01 favorable impact of foreign currency translation increased sales of products with relatively higher margins and productivity gains were partially offset by among other things asset writeoffs resulting in an estimated net favorable impact of 02

operating expenses 

selling and administrative expense was 17 billion or 240 of revenues in 2008 compared with 16 billion or 252 of revenues in 2007 the increase in aggregate expenses for 2008 reflect an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 80 million increases in base spending of 24 million and expenses of 9 million associated with tripath which was acquired in december 2006

research and development “rd” expense in 2008 was 396 million or 56 of revenues compared with 360 million or 57 of revenues in 2007 the increase in rd expenditures includes spending for new programs in each of our segments as previously discussed

operating income 

operating margin in 2008 was 217 of revenues compared with 189 in 2007 operating income of 12 billion in 2007 reflected 122 million of acquired inprocess rd charges as further discussed above which lowered 2007 operating margin by 190 basis points

nonoperating expense and income 

interest expense was 36 million in 2008 compared with 46 million in 2007 reflecting a decline in interest rates interest income was 39 million in 2008 compared with 46 million in 2007 the favorable impact of higher investment levels was more than offset by investment losses in assets we hold to offset liabilities related to our deferred compensation plan the related reduction in the deferred compensation liability was recorded as a reduction in selling and administrative expenses 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate in 2008 was 275 compared with the 2007 rate of 290 the 2007 rate reflected the nondeductibility of the acquired inprocess rd charges of 122 million which was partially offset by the impact of approximately 03 resulting from the retroactive reinstatement of the research and experimentation tax credit

income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2008 were 11 billion and 442 respectively income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2007 were 842 million and 330 respectively the acquired inprocess rd charges decreased income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2007 by 122 million and by 48 respectively

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash flows from continuing operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2008 of 17 billion increased 435 million over 2007 the increase in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities reflects improvements in accounts receivable and inventory

net cash flows from continuing investing activities 

net cash used for continuing investing activities in 2008 was 783 million compared with 10 billion in 2007 acquisitions of businesses represented the net cash paid for the cytopeia acquisition in 2008 and for the tripath acquisition in 2007 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion on acquisitions capital expenditures were 602 million in 2008 compared with 556 million in 2007 medical capital spending of 378 million and diagnostics capital spending of 124 million in 2008 related primarily to various capacity expansions biosciences capital spending of 83 million in 2008 included spending on manufacturing capacity expansions

net cash flows from continuing financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 586 million in 2008 as compared with 726 million in 2007 and included the repurchase of shares of our common stock for approximately 450 million in both years total debt was 12 billion at both september 30 2008 and 2007 shortterm debt decreased to 17 of total debt at yearend from 18 at the end of 2007 floating rate debt was 35 of total debt at the end of 2008 and 36 at the end of 2007 our weighted average cost of total debt at the end of 2008 was 49 down from 57 at the end of 2007 debttocapitalization at yearend improved to 188 from 209 last year

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the

carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources for any given estimate or assumption made by management it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue from product sales is typically recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer however we recognize revenue for certain instruments sold from the biosciences segment upon installation at a customer’s site as installation of these instruments is considered a significant postdelivery obligation in addition for certain sales arrangements primarily in the us with multiple deliverables revenue and cost of products sold are recognized at the completion of each deliverable shipment installation and training these sales agreements are divided into separate units of accounting and revenue is recognized upon the completion of each deliverable based on the relative fair values of items delivered fair values are generally determined based on sales of the individual deliverables to other third parties

bd’s domestic businesses sell products primarily to distributors who resell the products to enduser customers we provide rebates to distributors that sell to enduser customers at prices determined under a contract between bd and the enduser customer provisions for rebates as well as sales discounts and returns are accounted for as a reduction of revenues when revenue is recognized

impairment of assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually or whenever indicators of impairment arise potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value at september 30 2009 there were no reporting units that were deemed to be at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived assets are reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present impairment reviews are based on a cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume revenue and expense growth rates changes in working capital use appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with bd’s business plans the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and potentially result in different impacts to bd’s results of operations actual results may differ from management’s estimates

investments 

we hold equity interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within or adjacent to bd’s strategic focus for investments in companies that are publicly traded market prices are available however for investments in companies that are not publicly traded fair value is difficult to determine we write down an investment when management believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future

tax valuation allowances 

bd maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history expected future earnings carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset

contingencies 

we are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including without limitation product liability antitrust and environmental matters as further discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses we establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters without considering possible thirdparty recoveries a determination of the amount of accruals if any for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue and when appropriate is developed after consultation with outside counsel the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters

given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur

charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance accordingly in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows 

benefit plans 

we have significant net pension and other postretirement benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate and expected return on plan assets other postretirement benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rates these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported in addition to the analysis below see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion

the discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date september 30 for the us pension plan we used a discount rate of 590 as of september 30 2009 which was based on an actuariallydetermined companyspecific yield curve the rate selected is used to measure liabilities as of the measurement date and for calculating the following year’s pension expense the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption although reviewed each year is changed less frequently due to the longterm nature of the assumption this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date rather it is used only in the calculation of pension expense to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider many factors including our historical assumptions compared with actual results benchmark data expected returns on various plan asset classes as well as current and expected asset allocations at september 30 2009 we used a longterm expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 800 for the us pension plan we believe our discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our us pension and other postretirement plans are as follows

 

 

sharebased compensation 

compensation cost relating to sharebased payment transactions is recognized in net income using a fair value measurement method all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options are recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense based on their fair values over the vesting period of the awards we determine the fair value of certain sharebased awards using a latticebased binomial option valuation model that incorporates certain assumptions such as the riskfree interest rate expected volatility expected dividend yield and expected life of the options see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion

cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements 

bd and its representatives may from timetotime make certain forwardlooking statements in publicly released materials both written and oral including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission press releases and our reports to shareholders forwardlooking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan” “expect” “believe” “intend” “will” “anticipate” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with among other things discussions of future operations and financial performance as well as our strategy for growth product development regulatory approvals market position and expenditures all statements that address operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to volume growth sales and earnings per share growth cash flows or uses and statements expressing views about future operating results — are forwardlooking statements

forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations of future events the forwardlooking statements are and will be based on management’s thencurrent views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of their dates investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements furthermore we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information future events and developments or otherwise except as required by applicable law or regulations

distribution 

bd’s products and services are marketed in the us and internationally through independent sales representatives and independent distribution channels and directly to endusers sales to a single us distributor that supplies products from the bd medical and bd diagnostics segments to many endusers accounted for approximately 9 of total bd revenues in fiscal 2007 however the endusers of bd’s products have access to them through other distributors and as a result bd believes that sales to this distributor would be replaced largely if not entirely by other sales if bd no longer sold products to this distributor order backlog is not material to bd’s business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock bd’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the bd medical segment and respiratory and flu diagnostic products in the bd diagnostics segment that relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza 

raw materials 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment are not available from multiple sources in the case of certain principal raw materials that are available from multiple sources for various reasons including quality assurance and cost effectiveness bd elects to purchase these raw materials from sole suppliers in other cases where there are regulatory requirements relating to qualification of suppliers bd may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis while bd works closely with its suppliers to ensure continuity of supply the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 

research and development

intellectual property and licenses 

bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bd’s business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bd’s business as a whole or any business segment 

competition 

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace whose dynamics are changing technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology and regulation of increasingly more sophisticated and complex medical products is increasing companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of safetyengineered devices and in life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among other companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment 

bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to implement one of its core strategies—to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers—and maintain an advantage in the competitive environment in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement 

thirdparty reimbursement 

healthcare providers andor facilities are generally reimbursed for their services through numerous payment systems designed by governmental agencies eg medicare and medicaid in the us the national health service in the uk the joint federal committee in germany the commission d’evaluation des produits et prestations in france and the ministry for health labor and welfare in japan private insurance companies and managed care programs the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case typically depends on the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at the payer’s discretion the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products thus changes in reimbursement level or method may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products while bd is actively engaged in promoting the value of its products for payers and patients and it employs various efforts and resources to positively impact coverage coding and payment processes in this regard it has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and adequate payment level for bd products additionally we expect many payers to continue to explore costcontainment strategies eg competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services within the medicare program socalled “payforperformance” programs implemented by various public and private payers etc that could potentially impact coverage andor payment levels for current or future bd products 

as bd’s product offerings are diverse across many healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment systems therefore while individual countries product lines or product classes may be impacted bd does not believe that significant changes to any one of these systems would have a material adverse effect on bd 

regulation 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews of bd’s manufacturing processes and product performance these regulatory controls can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and 

continued availability of new products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes 

  these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

in november 2006 we received a warning letter from the fda with respect to our facility in san lorenzo puerto rico at which we manufacture certain blood collection products the warning letter makes certain observations regarding our compliance with the current good manufacturing practices requirements of the fda’s quality system regulation in response to the warning letter bd developed and implemented a comprehensive corrective and preventive action plan that was completed in fiscal year 2007 the fda recently reinspected the san lorenzo facility and found all warning letter commitments met and satisfactory we are awaiting a closeout letter 

bd believes it is in compliance in all material respects with the regulations promulgated by such agencies and that such compliance has not had and bd believes should not have a material adverse effect on bd bd also believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations such compliance has not had and bd believes should not have a material adverse effect on bd see item 3 legal proceedings 

employees 

as of september 30 2007 bd had 28018 employees of whom 12803 were employed in the united states including puerto rico bd believes that its employee relations are satisfactory 

other matters

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows 

bd’s future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers the development of these products requires significant research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including bd’s ability to innovate develop and manufacture new products complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad or gain and maintain market approval of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 

the medical device industry is very competitive 

the medical device industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than us we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than us with respect to particular markets nonmedical device companies including pharmaceutical companies also offer alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device see “competition” under item 1 business the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in addition some competitors have established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations as a means to lower their costs new entrants may also appear particularly from these lowcost countries 

inflation and fluctuations in the cost of raw materials could adversely affect the results of our operations 

  it is possible that general inflation rates will rise in 2008 and beyond and could have a greater impact on worldwide economies and consequently on bd bd purchases supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products any significant increases in resin purchase costs could impact future operating results 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials would adversely affect bd’s manufacturing operations and related product sales 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials we have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of these materials however certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons bd elects to purchase certain raw materials from sole suppliers while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition where there are regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement 

sources on a timely basis the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in addition in some instances the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants as a result natural disasters including pandemic disease political change or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products 

bd is subject to a number of pending lawsuits  

bd is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits including purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and product liability and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in item 3 legal proceedings given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s results of operations and cash flows 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

the medical device industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations “gpos” and integrated health delivery networks “idns” have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the us or abroad in a manner could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using bd medical devices or result in denial of reimbursement for those products see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the product can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market any recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

bd is subject to extensive regulation 

bd is subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of bd’s products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart nonus regulatory agencies before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products 

  following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay the production or marketing of our products and result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or seizures or recalls of products 

we cannot guarantee that any of bd’s strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

while our strategy to increase revenue growth is driven primarily by internal product development we will seek to supplement our growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate it into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

over half of our fiscal year 2007 revenues were derived from international operations our revenues outside the us are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the heading “financial instrument market risk” under “financial review” contained in exhibit 13 which is incorporated herein by reference we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

the international operations of bd’s business may subject bd to certain business risks 

bd operations outside the us subject bd to certain risks including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange as discussed above changes in foreign regulatory requirements potential political instability trade barriers weakening of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders the success of our operations outside the us will depend in part on our ability to acquire or form alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and distribution networks 

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our bd biosciences segment 

our bd biosciences segment sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and agencies in other countries for their funding the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable in addition there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property rights 

many of bd’s businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property rights while we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other intellectual property asset would materially affect bd operations these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business bd can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have a material adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

natural disasters war or terrorism could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

natural disasters war terrorism and international conflicts and actions taken by the united states and other governments in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the us and in areas outside of the us in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or our ability to source materials from our suppliers

bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bd’s business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bd’s business as a whole 

competition 

bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace whose dynamics are changing technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology and regulation of increasingly more sophisticated and complex medical products is increasing companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of safetyengineered devices and in life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among other companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment 

bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to implement one of its core strategies—to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers—and maintain an advantage in the competitive environment in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement 

thirdparty reimbursement 

healthcare providers andor facilities are generally reimbursed for their services through numerous payment systems designed by governmental agencies eg medicare and medicaid in the us the national health service in the uk the joint federal committee in germany the commission d’evaluation des produits et prestations in france and the ministry for health labor and welfare in japan private insurance companies and managed care programs the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case typically depends on the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at the payer’s discretion the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products thus changes in reimbursement level or method may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products while bd is actively engaged in promoting the value of its products for payers and patients and it employs various efforts and resources to positively impact coverage coding and payment processes in this regard it has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and adequate payment level for bd products additionally we expect many payers to continue to explore costcontainment strategies that could potentially impact coverage andor payment levels for current or future bd products 

as bd’s product offerings are diverse across many healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment systems therefore bd does not believe that significant changes to any one of these systems while potentially impacting individual product lines or classes would have a material adverse effect on bd 

regulation 

bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews of bd’s manufacturing processes and product performance these regulatory controls can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes 

these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

in november 2006 we received a warning letter from the fda with respect to our facility in san lorenzo puerto rico at which we manufacture certain blood collection products the warning letter makes certain observations regarding our compliance with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the fda’s quality system regulation we are preparing a response plan for submission to the fda 

bd believes it is in compliance in all material respects with the regulations promulgated by such agencies and that such compliance has not had and bd believes should not have a material adverse effect on bd bd also believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations such compliance has not had and bd believes should not have a material adverse effect on bd see item 3 legal proceedings 

employees 

as of september 30 2006 bd had 26990 employees of whom 12288 were employed in the united states including puerto rico bd believes that its employee relations are satisfactory

cautionary statement pursuant to private securities litigation reform act of 1995—“safe harbor” for forwardlooking statements 

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “act” provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of bd bd and its representatives may from time to time make certain forwardlooking statements in publicly released materials both written and oral including statements contained in this report and filings with the sec and in our other reports to shareholders forwardlooking statements may be identified by the use of words like plan expect “believe” “intend” will anticipate estimate and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with among other things discussions of future operations and financial performance as well as our strategy for growth product development regulatory approvals market position and expenditures all statements that address operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future – including statements relating to volume growth sales and earnings per share growth and statements expressing views about future operating results – are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the act 

forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations of future events the forwardlooking statements are and will be based on managements thencurrent views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of their dates investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements furthermore we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events and developments or otherwise 

the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements 

regional national and foreign economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues expenses and resulting margins 

we operate in a highly competitive environment new product introductions by our current or future competitors could adversely affect our ability to compete in the global market for example new forms of inhaled or other methods of insulin delivery such as the new inhaled form of insulin approved by the fda and european authorities could adversely impact sales of our insulin injection devices patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely impact our competitive position 

changes in domestic and foreign healthcare industry practices and regulations resulting in increased pricing pressures including the continued consolidation among healthcare providers trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion reimbursement and pricing generally 

the effects if any of governmental and media activities relating to us congressional hearings regarding the business practices of group purchasing organizations which negotiate product prices on behalf of their member hospitals with bd and other suppliers 

fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and the ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships particularly with respect to solesource suppliers and the potential adverse effects of any disruption in the availability of such raw materials 

our ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of any restructuring programs that we may undertake 

adoption of or changes in government laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign operations including those relating to trade monetary and fiscal policies taxation environmental matters sales 

practices price controls licensing and regulatory approval of new products or changes in enforcement practices with respect to any such laws and regulations fluctuations in us and international governmental funding and policies for life science research 

difficulties inherent in product development including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals in the united states and abroad or gain and maintain market approval of products as well as the possibility of encountering infringement claims by competitors with respect to patent or other intellectual property rights all of which can preclude or delay commercialization of a product 

pending and potential litigation or other proceedings adverse to bd including antitrust claims product liability claims and patent infringement claims as well as other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our sec filings 

the effects if any of adverse media exposure or other publicity regarding bd’s business or operations 

our ability to achieve earnings forecasts which are generated based on projected volumes and sales of many product types some of which are more profitable than others there can be no assurance that we will achieve the projected level or mix of product sales 

the effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in bd’s pension plans and the possibility that bd may need to make additional contributions to the plans as a result of any decline in the value of such assets 

our ability to effect infrastructure enhancements and incorporate new systems technologies into our operations 

product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls regulatory action on the part of the fda or foreign counterparts or declining sales 

economic and political conditions in international markets including civil unrest governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders 

the effects of natural disasters including hurricanes or pandemic diseases on our ability to manufacture our products particularly where production of a product line is concentrated in one or more plants or on our ability to source components from suppliers that are needed for such manufacturing 

our ability to penetrate developing and emerging markets which also depends on economic and political conditions and how well we are able to acquire or form strategic business alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities distribution networks sales equipment and technology 

the impact of business combinations including acquisitions and divestitures both internally for bd and externally in the healthcare industry 

issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board or the sec 

the foregoing list sets forth many but not all of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forwardlooking statements investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties 




 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the significant risks that could impact bd’s business financial condition or operating results 

bd’s future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 

a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers the development of these products requires significant research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including bd’s ability to innovate develop and manufacture new products complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad or gain and maintain market approval of our products in addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 

the medical device industry is very competitive 

the medical device industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than us we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than us with respect to particular markets nonmedical device companies including pharmaceutical companies also offer alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device see “competition” under item 1 business in addition some competitors have established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations as a means to lower their costs new entrants may also appear particularly in these lowcost countries 

the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may materially adversely affect our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials would adversely affect bd’s manufacturing operations and related product sales 

bd purchases many different types of raw materials we have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of these materials however certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment are not available from multiple sources in addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons bd elects to purchase certain raw materials from sole suppliers while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful in addition where there are regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products and have a material adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in addition in some instances the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants as a result natural disasters including pandemic disease political change or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

bd is subject to a number of pending lawsuits  

bd is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits including purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and product liability and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in item 3 legal proceedings given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles bd establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses from these actions are estimable in view of the uncertainties discussed above we 

could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bd’s results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods in which they are recorded or paid 

consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

the medical device industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations “gpos” and integrated health delivery networks “idns” have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products and adversely affect bd’s earnings financial condition or cash flows 

changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 

our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the us or abroad in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using bd medical devices or that denies coverage for those products may materially adversely affect our earnings financial condition or cash flows see “thirdparty reimbursement” under item 1 business 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the product can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market any recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

bd is subject to extensive regulation 

bd is subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies most of bd’s products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart nonus regulatory agencies before they can be marketed or sold the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products 

following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay the production or marketing of our products and result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or seizures or recalls of products any of which could materially adversely affect our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

we cannot guarantee that any of bd’s strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful 

while our strategy to increase revenue growth is driven primarily by internal product development we will seek to supplement our growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances such transactions are inherently risky the success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate it into our existing business there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful or that the transaction will not materially adversely affect our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 

over half of our fiscal year 2006 revenues were derived from international operations our revenues outside the us are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the heading “financial instrument market risk” under “financial review” contained in exhibit 13 which is incorporated herein by reference we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

the international operations of bd’s business may subject bd to certain business risks 

bd operations outside the us subject bd to certain risks including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange as discussed above changes in foreign regulatory requirements potential political instability trade barriers weakening of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders the success of our operations outside the us will depend in part on our ability to acquire or form alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and distribution networks 

reductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our bd biosciences segment 

our bd biosciences segment sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions a number of these customers are also dependent upon grants from us government agencies such as the us national institutes of health “nih” and agencies in other countries for their funding the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable in addition there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 

our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property rights 

many of bd’s businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property rights while we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other intellectual property asset would materially affect bd operations these intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business bd can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have a material adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 

natural disasters war or terrorism could adversely affect bd’s future revenues and operating income 

natural disasters war terrorism and international conflicts and actions taken by the united states and other governments in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the us and in areas outside of the us in which we operate these events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or our ability to source materials from our suppliers and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows

  foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues bd believes its activities in some countries outside the united states involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the foregoing factors as well as local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties 

distribution 

  bd’s products and services are marketed in the us and internationally through independent sales representatives and independent distribution channels and directly to endusers sales to a single us distributor that supplies products from the bd medical and bd diagnostics segments to many endusers accounted for approximately 11 of total bd revenues in fiscal 2005 however the endusers of bd’s products have access to them through other distributors and as a result bd believes that sales to this distributor would be replaced largely if not entirely by other sales if bd no longer sold products to this distributor order backlog is not material to bd’s business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock bd’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal although an incidence of the influenza virus can affect demand for certain medical devices in the bd medical segment and respiratory and flu diagnostic products of the bd diagnostics segment in various countries 

raw materials 

  bd purchases many different types of raw materials including plastics glass metals yarn and yarn goods paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products while all but a few of bd’s principal raw materials are available from multiple sources for various reasons eg quality assurance and cost effectiveness bd elects to purchase certain raw materials from sole suppliers however certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment are not available from multiple sources in other cases where there are regulatory requirements relating to qualification of suppliers bd may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis while bd works closely with its suppliers to ensure continuity of supply the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 

research and development 

  bd conducts its research and development activities at its operating units and at bd technologies in research triangle park north carolina substantially all of bd’s research and development activities are conducted in the us bd also collaborates with certain universities medical centers and other entities on research and development programs bd also retains individual consultants to support its efforts in specialized fields bd spent approximately 272 million 236 million and 224 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

intellectual property and licenses 

  bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bd’s business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bd’s business as a whole 

competition 

  bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace whose dynamics are changing technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology and regulation of increasingly more sophisticated and complex medical products is increasing companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of safetyengineered devices and in life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among other companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment 

  bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bd’s competitive position varies among bd’s various product offerings in order to implement one of its core strategies—to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers—and maintain an advantage in the competitive environment in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement 

thirdparty reimbursement 

  healthcare providers andor facilities are generally reimbursed for their services through numerous payment systems designed by governmental agencies eg medicare and medicaid in the us nhs in the uk mhlw in japan private insurance companies and managed care programs the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case typically depends on the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis or the devices andor drugs utilized or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at the payer’s discretion the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products thus changes in reimbursement level or method may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products while bd is actively engaged in promoting the value of its products for payers and patients and it employs various efforts and resources to identify and address reimbursement issues and minimize negative outcomes in this regard it has no control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and adequate payment level for bd products additionally many payers continue to explore cost containment strategies that could potentially impact coverage andor payment levels for current or future products 

  as bd’s product offerings are diverse across many healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment systems therefore bd does not believe that significant changes to any one of these systems while potentially impacting individual product lines or classes would have a material adverse effect on bd 

   bd’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of bd’s medical products the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

  prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews of bd’s manufacturing processes and product performance these regulatory controls can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes 

  these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions bd also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

  bd believes it is in compliance in all material respects with the regulations promulgated by such agencies and that such compliance has not had and bd believes should not have a material adverse effect on bd bd also believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations such compliance has not had and bd believes should not have a material adverse effect on bd see item 3 legal proceedings 

employees 

  as of september 30 2005 bd had 25571 employees of whom 11624 were employed in the united states including puerto rico bd believes that its employee relations are satisfactory

international operations 

  bds products are manufactured and sold worldwide bds operations outside the united states are conducted in canada and in five geographic regions europe including the middle east and africa japan asia pacific which includes australia and all of asia except japan south latin america which includes brazil and north latin america which includes mexico the principal products sold by bd outside of the united states are hypodermic needles and syringes insulin syringes and pen needles diagnostic systems bd vacutainer ™ brand blood collection products bd hypak ™ brand prefillable syringe systems infusion therapy products flow cytometry analyzers and sorters and disposable laboratory products bd has manufacturing operations outside the united states in brazil china france germany india ireland japan korea mexico pakistan singapore spain sweden and the united kingdom geographic information with respect to bds operations is included under the heading “geographic information” in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in exhibit 13 and is incorporated herein by reference 

  foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues bd believes its activities in some countries outside the united states involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the foregoing factors as well as local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties 

revenues and distribution 

  bds products and services are marketed in the us and internationally through sales representatives and independent distribution channels and directly to endusers sales to a single us distributor that supplies products from the bd medical and bd diagnostics segments to many endusers accounted for approximately 11 of total bd revenues in fiscal 2004 however the endusers of bds products have access to them through other distributors and as a result bd believes that sales to this distributor would be replaced largely if not entirely by other sales if bd no longer sold products to this distributor order backlog is not material to bds business inasmuch as orders for bd products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock bds worldwide sales are not generally seasonal although an incidence of the influenza virus can affect demand for certain medical devices in the bd medical segment and respiratory and flu diagnostic products of the bd diagnostics segment in various countries 

  revenues on the sale of certain instruments in the bd biosciences segment are recognized upon completion of installation of the instrument at the customers site in other instances in the bd biosciences segment where the sales agreement provides for multiple deliverables revenue is recognized at the completion of each deliverable substantially all other revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title passes to customers bd provides rebates to distributors that sell to enduser customers at prices determined under a contract between bd and the enduser customer or distributor bd estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid and records the liability as a reduction of revenues when bd records the sale of the product 

raw materials 

  bd purchases many different types of raw materials including plastics glass metals yarn and yarn goods paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products while all but a few of bds principal raw materials are available from multiple sources for various reasons eg quality assurance and cost effectiveness bd elects to purchase certain raw materials from sole suppliers however certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment are not available from multiple sources in other cases where there are regulatory requirements relating to 

qualification of suppliers bd may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis while bd works closely with its suppliers to ensure continuity of supply the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 

research and development 

  bd conducts its research and development activities at its operating units and at bd technologies in research triangle park north carolina substantially all of bds research and development activities are conducted in the us bd also collaborates with certain universities medical centers and other entities on research and development programs bd also retains individual consultants to support its efforts in specialized fields bd spent approximately 236 million 224 million and 207 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended september 30 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

intellectual property and licenses 

  bd owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the united states and other countries bd is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to bds business bd believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to bds business as a whole 

competition 

  bd operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace whose dynamics are changing technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology and regulation of increasingly more sophisticated and complex medical products is increasing companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field some are more specialized than bd with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than bd new companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well acquisitions and collaborations by and among other companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment 

  bd competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion the impact of these factors on bds competitive position varies among bds various product offerings in order to implement one of its core strategies—to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers—and maintain an advantage in the competitive environment in which it operates bd continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement 

thirdparty reimbursement 

  healthcare providers andor facilities are generally reimbursed for their services through numerous payment systems designed by governmental agencies eg medicare and medicaid in the us nhs in the uk mhlw in japan private insurance companies and managed care programs the manner and level of reimbursement in any given case typically depends on the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis or the devices andor drugs utilized or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at the payers discretion the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products thus changes in reimbursement level or method may either positively or negatively impact sales of bd products while bd is actively engaged in promoting the value of its products for payers and patients and it employs various efforts and resources to identify and address reimbursement 

issues and minimize negative outcomes in this regard it has no control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and adequate payment level for bd products 

  as bds product offerings are diverse across many healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment systems therefore bd does not believe that significant changes to any one of these systems while potentially impacting individual product lines or classes would have a material adverse effect on bd 

regulation 

  bds medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration “fda” and various other federal and state agencies as well as by a number of foreign governmental agencies these agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of medical products of the type manufactured by bd the scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the europe japan and asia pacific regions in which bd operates has been increasing 

  prior to marketing or selling most of its products bd must secure approval from the fda and counterpart nonus regulatory agencies following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in an ongoing review of bds manufacturing processes and product performance these regulatory controls can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products where possible bd anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes 

  these agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against bd such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions from timetotime bd has undertaken voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls 

  bd believes it is in compliance in all material respects with the regulations promulgated by such agencies and that such compliance has not had and bd believes should not have a material adverse effect on bd bd also believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations such compliance has not had and bd believes should not have a material adverse effect on bd see item 3 legal proceedings—environmental matters 

employees 

  as of september 30 2004 bd had 25005 employees of whom 11441 were employed in the united states including puerto rico bd believes that its employee relations are satisfactory 

available information 

  bd maintains a website at wwwbdcom  bd makes available its annual reports on form 10k its quarterly reports on form 10q and its current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission these filings may be found at wwwbdcominvestors  printed copies of the foregoing documents may also be obtained without charge by contacting investor relations becton dickinson and company 1 becton drive franklin lakes new jersey 074171880 phone 18002846845

item 3 legal proceedings

litigation  other than environmental

    in 1986 we acquired a business that manufactured among other things latex
surgical gloves in 1995 we divested this glove business we along with a
number of other manufacturers have been named as a defendant in approximately
524 product liability lawsuits related to natural rubber latex that have been
filed in various state and federal courts cases pending in federal court are
being coordinated under the matter in re latex gloves products liability
litigation mdl docket no 1148 in philadelphia and analogous procedures have
been implemented in the state courts of california pennsylvania new jersey and
new york generally these actions allege that medical personnel have suffered
allergic reactions ranging from skin irritation to anaphylaxis as a result of
exposure to medical gloves containing natural rubber latex since the inception
of this litigation 377 of these cases have been closed with no liability to bd
313 of which were closed with prejudice and 28 cases have been settled for an
aggregate de minimis amount we are vigorously defending these remaining
lawsuits

    we along with another manufacturer and several medical product
distributors are named as a defendant in four product liability lawsuits
relating to healthcare workers who allegedly sustained accidental needlesticks
but have not become infected with any disease generally the remaining actions
allege that healthcare workers have sustained needlesticks using hollowbore
needle devices manufactured by bd and as a result require medical testing
counseling andor treatment several actions additionally allege that the
healthcare workers have sustained mental anguish plaintiffs seek money damages
in all of these actions we had previously been named as a defendant in seven
similar suits relating to healthcare workers who allegedly sustained accidental
needlesticks each of which has either been dismissed with prejudice or
voluntarily withdrawn regarding the four pending suits

     in ohio grant vs becton dickinson et al case no 98cvb075616 franklin
     county court which was filed on july 22 1998 the court of appeals by
     order dated june 3 2003 reversed the trial courts granting of class
     certification and remanded the case for a determination of whether the
     class can be redefined or the action should be dismissed

     in illinois mccaster vs becton dickinson et al case no 98l09478 cook
     county circuit court which was filed on august 13 1998 the court issued
     an order on november 22 2002 denying plaintiffs renewed motion for class
     certification the plaintiff has voluntarily dismissed the action without
     prejudice and with leave to refile within one year

     in oklahoma and south carolina cases have been filed on behalf of an
     unspecified number of healthcare workers seeking class action certification
     under the laws of these states  in state court in oklahoma under the
     caption palmer vs becton dickinson et al case no cj98685 sequoyah

     court filed on october 27 1998 and in state court in south carolina
     under the caption bales vs becton dickinson et al case no
     98cp404343 richland county court of common pleas filed on november
     25 1998

    we continue to oppose class action certification in these cases and will
continue vigorously to defend these lawsuits including pursuing all appropriate
rights of appeal

    bd has insurance policies in place and believes that a substantial portion
of the potential liability if any in the latex and class action matters would
be covered by insurance in order to protect our rights to additional coverage
we filed an action for declaratory judgment under the caption becton dickinson
and company vs adriatic insurance company et al docket no midl364999mt
middlesex county superior court in new jersey state court we have withdrawn
this action with the right to refile so that settlement discussions with the
insurance companies may proceed we have established reserves to cover
reasonably anticipated legal defense costs in all product liability lawsuits
including the needlestick class action and latex matters with regard to the
latex matters we recorded special charges in 2000 and 1998 of 20 million and
12 million respectively based on a review of available information at that
time these charges were recorded to reflect the minimum amount within the then
most probable range of current estimates of litigation defense costs we do not
anticipate incurring significant onetime charges similar to 2000 and 1998
relating to the latex matters in future years

    on november 6 2003 a class action complaint was filed against the company
in the supreme court of british columbia under the caption danielle cardozo by
her litigation guardian darlene cardozo v becton dickinson and company civil
action no s83059 alleging personal injury to all persons in british columbia
that received test results generated by the bd probetec et instrument
plaintiffs seek money damages in an as yet undisclosed amount we are assessing
this action and intend to vigorously defend this matter

    on january 17 2003 retractable technologies inc plaintiff filed a
third amended complaint against bd another manufacturer and two group
purchasing organizations gpos under the caption retractable technologies
inc vs becton dickinson and company et al civil action no 501 cv 036
united states district court eastern district of texas plaintiff alleges that
bd and other defendants conspired to exclude it from the market and to maintain
bds market share by entering into longterm contracts in violation of state and
federal antitrust laws plaintiff also has asserted claims for business
disparagement common law conspiracy and tortious interference with business
relationships plaintiff seeks money damages in an as yet undisclosed amount on
october 6 2003 bd filed a motion for summary judgment argument of that motion
was heard on december 11 2003 and a trial date has been set for february 3
2004 we continue to vigorously defend this matter

    we also are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other legal
proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business

    we currently are engaged in discovery or are otherwise in the early stages
with respect to certain of the litigation to which we are a party and
therefore it is difficult to predict the outcome of such litigation in
addition given the uncertain nature of litigation generally and of the current
litigation environment it is difficult to predict the outcome of any litigation
regardless of its stage a number of the cases pending against bd present
complex factual and legal issues and are subject to a number of variables
including but not limited to the facts and circumstances of each particular
case the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought and differences in
applicable law as a result we are not able to estimate the amount or range of
loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of such matters in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves
to the extent probable future losses are estimable while we believe that the
claims against bd are without merit and upon resolution should not have a
material adverse effect on bd in view of the uncertainties discussed above we
could incur charges in excess of currently established reserves and to the
extent available excess liability insurance accordingly in the opinion of
management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could
have a material adverse effect on bds consolidated results of operations and
consolidated net cash flows in the period or periods in which they are recorded
or paid we continue to believe that we have a number of valid defenses to each
of the suits pending against bd and are engaged in a vigorous defense of each of
these matters

environmental matters

    we are also a party to a number of federal proceedings in the united states
brought under the comprehensive environment response compensation and liability
act also known as superfund and

                                       7




page

similar state laws for all sites there are other potentially responsible
parties that may be jointly or severally liable to pay all cleanup costs we
accrue costs for estimated environmental liabilities based upon our best
estimate within the range of probable losses without considering possible
thirdparty recoveries while we believe that upon resolution of such matters
the claims against bd should not have a material adverse effect on bd we could
incur charges in excess of presently established reserves and to the extent
available excess liability insurance accordingly in the opinion of
management any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could
have a material adverse effect on bds consolidated results of operations and
consolidated net cash flows in the period or periods in which they are recorded
or paid

countries outside the united states involve greater risk than its domestic
business due to the foregoing factors as well as local commercial and economic
policies and political uncertainties

revenues and distribution

internationally through sales representatives and independent distribution
channels and directly to endusers sales to a distributor which supplies bd
products from the medical systems and clinical laboratory solutions segments to
many endusers accounted for approximately 11 of total bd revenues in fiscal
2002 order backlog is not material to bds business inasmuch as orders for bd
products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items
temporarily out of stock

    revenue on the sale of certain instruments in the biosciences segment is
recognized upon completion of installation of the instrument at the customers

competition

    a number of companies some of which are more specialized than bd compete
in the medical technology field in each such case competition involves only a
part of bds product lines competition in bds markets is based on a
combination of factors including price quality service reputation
distribution and promotion ongoing investments in research quality management
quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement are
required to maintain an advantage in the competitive environments in which bd
operates

    new companies have entered the medical technology field and established

    for various reasons including quality assurance sole source availability
and cost effectiveness we purchase certain raw materials from sole suppliers
due primarily to regulatory requirements we may not always be able to quickly
establish additional or replacement sources for certain of these solesourced
raw materials while bd works closely with its suppliers to ensure continuity of
supply the termination reduction or interruption in supply of these
solesourced raw materials could have an adverse impact on our ability to
manufacture and sell certain of our products

the united states food and drug administration and various other federal and
state agencies as well as by a number of foreign governmental agencies bd

believes should not have a material adverse effect on its business

cautionary statement pursuant to private securities litigation reform act of
1995  safe harbor for forwardlooking statements

    the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the act provides a
safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of bd bd and
its representatives may from time to time make certain forwardlooking
statements in publiclyreleased materials both written and oral including
statements contained in this report and filings with the securities and exchange
commission and in our other reports to shareholders forwardlooking statements
may be identified by the use of words like plan expect believe
intend will anticipate estimate and other words of similar meaning in
conjunction with among other things discussions of future operations and
financial performance as well as our strategy for growth product development
regulatory approvals market position and expenditures all statements which
address operating performance or events or developments that we expect or
anticipate will occur in the future  including statements relating to volume
growth sales and earnings per share growth and statements expressing views
about future operating results  are forwardlooking statements within the
meaning of the act

    forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations of future
events the forwardlooking statements are and will be based on managements
then current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating
performance and speak only as of their dates investors should realize that if
underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties
materialize actual results could vary materially from our expectations and
projections investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on
any forwardlooking statements furthermore we undertake no obligation to
update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new
information future events and developments or otherwise

    the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results
to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements

    o regional national and foreign economic factors including inflation and
      fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and the
      potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues expenses and resulting
      margins

    o competitive product and pricing pressures and our ability to gain or
      maintain market share in the global market as a result of actions by
      competitors including technological advances achieved and patents
      attained by competitors as patents on our products expire while we
      believe our opportunities for sustained profitable growth are
      considerable actions of our competitors could impact our earnings
      share of sales and volume growth

                                       3

     o changes in domestic and foreign healthcare resulting in pricing
       pressures including the continued consolidation among healthcare
       providers trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment
       and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion
       reimbursement and pricing generally

     o the effects if any of governmental and media activities relating to
       us congressional hearings regarding the business practices of group
       purchasing organizations which negotiate product prices on behalf of
       their member hospitals with bd and other suppliers

     o fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and the
       ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships

     o adoption of or changes in government laws and regulations affecting
       domestic and foreign operations including those relating to trade
       monetary and fiscal policies taxation environmental matters sales
       practices price controls licensing and regulatory approval of new
       products or changes in enforcement practices with respect to any such
       laws and regulations

     o difficulties inherent in product development including the potential
       inability to successfully continue technological innovation complete
       clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals in the united states and
       abroad or gain and maintain market approval of products and the
       possibility of encountering infringement claims by competitors with
       respect to patent or other intellectual property rights all of which
       can preclude or delay commercialization of a product

     o significant litigation adverse to bd including product liability claims
       patent infringement claims and antitrust claims as well as other risks
       and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our securities and
       exchange commission filings

     o the effects if any of adverse media exposure or other publicity
       regarding bds business operations or allegations made or related to
       litigation pending against bd

     o our ability to achieve earnings forecasts which are generated based on
       projected volumes and sales of many product types some of which are
       more profitable than others there can be no assurance that we will
       achieve the projected level or mix of product sales

     o the effect of market fluctuations on the value of the assets in bds
       pension plans and the possibility that bd may need to make additional
       contributions to the plans as a result of any decline in the value of
       such assets

     o our ability to effect infrastructure enhancements and incorporate new
       systems technologies into our operations

     o product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls
       regulatory action on the part of the food and drug administration or
       foreign counterparts or declining sales

     o economic and political conditions in international markets including
       civil unrest governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to
       transfer capital across borders

     o our ability to penetrate developing and emerging markets which also
       depends on economic and political conditions and our ability to
       successfully acquire or form strategic business alliances with local
       companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production
       facilities distribution networks sales equipment and technology

     o the impact of business combinations including acquisitions and
       divestitures both internally for bd and externally in the healthcare
       industry

     o issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the american
       institute of certified public accountants the financial accounting
       standards board or the securities and exchange commission

    the foregoing list sets forth many but not all of the factors that could
impact our ability to achieve results described in any forwardlooking
statements investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or
identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete
statement of all potential risks and uncertainties

item 3 legal proceedings

litigation  other than environmental

    in 1986 we acquired a business that manufactured among other things latex
surgical gloves in 1995 we divested this glove business we along with a
number of other manufacturers have been named as a defendant in approximately
520 product liability lawsuits related to natural rubber latex that have been
filed in various state and federal courts cases pending in federal court are
being coordinated under the matter in re latex gloves products liability
litigation mdl docket no 1148 in philadelphia and analogous procedures have
been implemented in the state courts of california pennsylvania new jersey and
new york generally these actions allege that medical personnel have suffered
allergic reactions ranging from skin irritation to anaphylaxis as a result of
exposure to medical gloves containing natural rubber latex since the inception
of this litigation 227 of these cases have been closed with no liability to bd
166 of which were closed with prejudice and 14 cases have been settled for an
aggregate de minimis amount we are vigorously defending the remaining lawsuits

    we along with another manufacturer and several medical product
distributors are named as a defendant in six product liability lawsuits
relating to healthcare workers who allegedly sustained accidental needlesticks
but have not become infected with any disease we had previously been named as a
defendant in five similar suits relating to healthcare workers who allegedly
sustained accidental needlesticks each of which has either been dismissed with
prejudice or voluntarily withdrawn regarding the six pending suits

     in texas usrey vs becton dickinson et al the court of appeals for the
     second district of texas filed an opinion on august 16 2001 reversing the
     trial courts certification of a class and remanding the case to the trial
     court for further proceedings consistent with that opinion plaintiffs
     petitioned the appellate court for rehearing which the court of appeals
     denied on october 25 2001

     in ohio grant vs becton dickinson et al case no 98cvb075616 franklin
     county court which was filed on july 22 1998 the court issued a
     decision on july 17 2002 certifying a class we have filed an appeal of
     the courts ruling with the ohio court of appeals for the 10th appellate
     judicial district

     in illinois mccaster vs becton dickinson et al case no 98l09478 cook
     county circuit court which was filed on august 13 1998 the appeals
     court issued a decision on march 6 2002 denying plaintiffs petition for
     review of the trial courts january 11 2002 decision to deny class
     certification on july 30 2002 the plaintiff filed a motion with the
     trial court to reopen the issue of certification based on the ohio decision
     in the grant case on november 22 2002 the court issued an order denying
     plaintiffs renewed motion for class certification

     in new york oklahoma and south carolina cases have been filed on behalf
     of an unspecified number of healthcare workers seeking class action
     certification under the laws of these states generally these remaining
     actions allege that healthcare workers have sustained needle sticks using
     hollowbore needle devices manufactured by bd and as a result require
     medical testing counseling andor treatment several actions additionally
     allege that the healthcare workers have sustained mental anguish
     plaintiffs seek money damages in all of these actions which are pending in
     state court in oklahoma under the caption palmer vs becton dickinson et
     al case no cj98685 sequoyah county district court filed on october
     27 1998 in state court in south carolina under the caption bales vs
     becton dickinson et al case no 98cp404343 richland county court of
     common pleas filed on november 25 1998 and in federal court in new
     york under the caption benner vs becton dickinson et al case
     no 99civ4798whp filed on june 1 1999

    we continue to oppose class action certification in these cases and will
continue vigorously to defend these lawsuits including pursuing all appropriate
rights of appeal

    bd has insurance policies in place and believes that a substantial portion
of the potential liability if any in the latex and class action matters would
be covered by insurance in order to protect our rights to additional coverage
we filed an action for declaratory judgement under the caption becton dickinson

superior court in new jersey state court we have withdrawn this action with
the right to refile so that settlement discussions with the insurance companies
may proceed we have established reserves to cover reasonably anticipated
defense costs in all product liability lawsuits including the needlestick class
action and latex matters

    on january 18 2002 retractable technologies inc plaintiff filed a
second amended complaint against bd another manufacturer and two group
purchasing organizations gpos under the caption retractable technologies
inc vs becton dickinson and company et al civil action no 501 cv 036
united states district court eastern district of texas plaintiff alleges that
bd and other defendants conspired to exclude it from the market and to maintain
bds market share by entering into longterm contracts in violation of state and
federal antitrust laws plaintiff also has asserted claims for business
disparagement common law conspiracy and tortious interference with business
relationships plaintiff seeks money damages in an as yet undisclosed amount on
february 22 2002 bd filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on
august 2 2002 the court issued a memorandum opinion and order denying that
motion discovery is proceeding and a trial date has been set for april 8
2003 we continue to vigorously defend this matter

    we also are involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other legal
proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business

    we currently are engaged in discovery or are otherwise in the early stages
with respect to certain of the litigation to which we are a party and
therefore it is difficult to predict the outcome of such litigation in
addition given the uncertain nature of litigation generally and of the current
litigation environment it is difficult to predict the outcome of any litigation
regardless of its stage a number of the cases pending against bd present
complex factual and legal issues and are subject to a number of variables
including but not limited to the facts and circumstances of each particular
case the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought and differences in
applicable law as a result we are not able to estimate the amount or range of
loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of such matters while we
believe that the claims against bd are without merit and upon resolution
should not have a material adverse effect on bd in view of the uncertainties
discussed above we could incur charges in excess of currently established
reserves and to the extent available excess liability insurance accordingly
in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the
aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bds consolidated results of
operations and consolidated net cash flows in the period or periods in which
they are recorded or paid we continue to believe that we have a number of valid
defenses to each of the suits pending against bd and are engaged in a vigorous
defense of each of these matters

environmental matters

    we are also a party to a number of federal proceedings in the united states
brought under the comprehensive environment response compensation and liability
act also known as superfund and similar state laws for all sites there are
other potentially responsible parties that may be jointly or severally liable to
pay all cleanup costs we accrue costs for estimated environmental liabilities
based upon our best estimate within the range of probable losses without
considering possible thirdparty recoveries while we believe that upon
resolution the environmental claims against bd should not have a material
adverse effect on bd we could incur charges in excess of presently established
reserves and to the extent available excess liability insurance accordingly
in the opinion of management any such future charges individually or in the
aggregate could have a material adverse effect on bds consolidated results of
operations and consolidated net cash flows in the period or periods in which
they are recorded or paid

cautionary statement pursuant to private securities litigation reform act of
1995  safe harbor for forwardlooking statements

    the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the act provides a
safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of bd bd and
its representatives may from time to time make certain forwardlooking
statements in publiclyreleased materials both written and oral including
statements contained in this report and filings with the securities and exchange
commission and in our other reports to shareholders forwardlooking statements
may be identified by the use of words like plan expect believe
intend will anticipate estimate and other words of similar meaning in
conjunction with among other things discussions of future operations and
financial performance as well as our strategy for growth product development
regulatory approvals market position and expenditures all statements which
address operating performance or events or developments that we expect or
anticipate will occur in the future  including statements relating to volume
growth sales and earnings per share growth and statements expressing views
about future operating results  are forwardlooking statements within the
meaning of the act

    forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations of future
events the forwardlooking statements are and will be based on managements
then current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating
performance and speak only as of their dates investors should realize that if
underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties
materialize actual results could vary materially from our expectations and
projections investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on
any forwardlooking statements furthermore we undertake no obligation to
update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new
information future events and developments or otherwise

    the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results
to differ from our expectations in any forwardlooking statements

     regional national and foreign economic factors including inflation and
     fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and the
     potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues expenses and resulting
     margins

     competitive product and pricing pressures and our ability to gain or
     maintain market share in the global market as a result of actions by
     competitors including technological advances achieved and patents attained
     by competitors as patents on our products expire while we believe our
     opportunities for sustained profitable growth are considerable actions of
     competitors could impact our earnings share of sales and volume growth

                                       3

     changes in domestic and foreign healthcare resulting in pricing pressures
     including the continued consolidation among healthcare providers trends
     toward managed care and healthcare cost containment and government laws and
     regulations relating to sales and promotion reimbursement and pricing
     generally

     fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and the ability
     to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships

     government laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign operations
     including those relating to trade monetary and fiscal policies taxation
     environmental matters price controls licensing and regulatory approval of
     new products

     difficulties inherent in product development including the potential
     inability to successfully continue technological innovation complete
     clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals in the united states and
     abroad or gain and maintain market approval of products and the
     possibility of encountering infringement claims by competitors with respect
     to patent or other intellectual property rights all of which can preclude
     or delay commercialization of a product

     significant litigation adverse to bd including product liability claims
     patent infringement claims and antitrust claims as well as other risks
     and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our securities and exchange
     commission filings

     our ability to achieve earnings forecasts which are generated based on
     projected volumes and sales of many product types some of which are more
     profitable than others there can be no assurance that we will achieve a
     projected level or mix of product sales

     product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls
     regulatory action on the part of the us food and drug administration or
     foreign counterparts or declining sales

     economic and political conditions in international markets including civil
     unrest governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer
     capital across borders

     our ability to penetrate developing and emerging markets which also
     depends on economic and political conditions and how well we are able to
     acquire or form strategic business alliances with local companies and make
     necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities
     distribution networks sales equipment and technology

     the impact of business combinations including acquisitions and
     divestitures both internally for bd and externally in the healthcare
     industry

     issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the american institute
     of certified public accountants the financial accounting standards board
     or the securities and exchange commission

    the foregoing list sets forth many but not all of the factors that could
impact our ability to achieve results described in any forwardlooking
statements investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or
identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete
statement of all potential risks and uncertainties
