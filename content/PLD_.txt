with the broadening of ecommerce adoption driving requirements for increased warehouse space to store inventory surging customer demand has continued to outpace supply we believe this demand surge is driven by three primary factors i overall consumption growth ii customer supply chains still repositioning to address the significant shift to ecommerce as well as preparing for higher growth and service expectations and iii our customers’ desire for more supply chain resiliency with inventorytosales ratios below prepandemic levels our customers not only need to restock for this shortfall but build an additional safety stock we believe these forces have placed a premium on speedtomarket and flexibility driving demand for years to come 

 

the scale of our 10 billion square foot portfolio allows us to help our customers in a multitude of unique ways we continue to focus on differentiated ways to meet our customers’ needs through our prologis essentials business this program includes product and service solutions for our customers’ operations workforce energy transportation and data and analytic needs our integrated suite of solutions allows our customers to benefit from our global scale strategic partnerships with vendors and local expertise to obtain services and products more efficiently we use our proprietary data and analytics to provide our customers actionable insights on everything from inventory shipping security communications management and dock visibility

at december 31 2021 we owned or had investments in on a whollyowned basis or through ventures properties and development projects based on gross book value and total expected investment at completion respectively in the following geographies 

 

 

throughout this discussion we reflect amounts in the united states “us” dollar our reporting currency included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies principally the british pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated to us dollars we mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by investing outside the us through coinvestment ventures borrowing in the functional currency of our subsidiaries and utilizing derivative financial instruments

 

 

 

operating segments

 

our business comprises two operating segments real estate operations and strategic capital 

 

below is information summarizing consolidated activity within our segments over the last three years in millions 

 

 



 



 

 

real estate operations

 

rental rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contribute 85 to 90 of our consolidated revenues earnings and ffo we collect rent from our customers through operating leases including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs for leases that commenced during 2021 within the consolidated operating portfolio the weighted average lease term was 62 months we expect to generate internal growth by increasing rents maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses the primary driver of our revenue growth will be rolling inplace leases to current market rents as leases expire we believe our active portfolio management combined with the skills of our property leasing maintenance capital energy sustainability and risk management teams allow us to maximize noi across our portfolio substantially all of our consolidated rental revenue noi and cash flows are generated in the us 

 

development given the scarcity of modern logistics facilities in our target markets our development business provides the opportunity to build to our customers’ current and future requirements and deepen our market presence we believe we have a competitive advantage due to i the strategic locations of our global land bank and redevelopment sites ii the development expertise of our local teams iii the depth of our customer relationships and iv our ability to integrate sustainable design features and practices as detailed in our environmental stewardship social responsibility and governance section below that result in costsavings and operational efficiencies for our customers successful development and redevelopment efforts provide significant earnings growth as projects are leased generate income and increase the net asset value of our real estate operations segment generally we develop properties in the us for longterm hold and outside the us for contribution to our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures 

 

strategic capital

 

our strategic capital segment allows us to partner with many of the world’s largest institutional investors we capitalize our business through private equity principally perpetual openended or longterm ventures and two publicly traded vehicles nippon prologis reit inc in japan and fibra prologis in mexico we align our interests with our partners by holding significant ownership interests in all of our eight unconsolidated coinvestment ventures ranging from 15 to 50 this structure allows us to reduce our exposure to foreign currency movements for investments outside the us

 

this segment produces durable longterm cash flows and generally contributes 10 to 15 of our recurring consolidated revenues earnings and ffo we generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures principally through asset management and property management services asset management fees are primarily driven by the real estate valuation of the respective ventures we earn additional revenues by providing leasing acquisition construction management development and disposition services in certain ventures we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees “promotes” or “promote revenues” periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation based primarily on the appreciation of the portfolio  we plan to profitably grow this business by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures most of the strategic capital revenues are generated outside the us

 

 

 

future growth

 

we believe the quality and scale of our global portfolio our ability to build out the global land bank our strategic capital business the expertise of our team the depth of our customer relationships and the strength of our balance sheet are differentiators that allow us to drive growth in revenues noi earnings ffo and cash flows

 

 



 



 

we are able to maintain strong margins despite rising construction costs as we experienced in 2021 due to our procurement activities that mitigate a portion of the inflationary increases as well as rising market rents we measure the estimated value creation of a development project as the margin above our tei based on our current estimates our consolidated land including options and covered land plays has the potential to support the development of 222 billion 264 billion on an om basis of tei of new logistics space as properties stabilize we expect to realize the value creation principally through contributions to unconsolidated coinvestment ventures and increases in the noi of the consolidated portfolio our current investment in the development portfolio was 27 billion and we expect our development activities to increase in 2022 

 



 

 

 

 



 



 



 



 

competition 

 

real estate ownership is highly fragmented and we face competition from many owners and operators competitively priced logistics space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge which in turn could affect our operating results we face competition regarding our capital deployment activities including regional national and global operators or developers we also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business

 

despite the competition our global reach and local market knowledge over the years has given us distinct competitive advantages including the following

environmental matters

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired including land while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect beyond amounts recorded at december 31 2021 see further discussion in item 1a risk factors and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

 

governmental matters

 

we are exposed to various regulatory requirements taxes tariffs trade wars and laws within the countries in which we operate and unexpected changes in these items may result in unanticipated losses adverse tax consequences and affect our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be impacted by the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations and transfer pricing regulations the impact of regional or countryspecific economic instability including government shutdowns or other internal trade alliances or agreements could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see further discussion in item 1a risk factors

 

insurance coverage

 

we carry insurance coverage on our properties we determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance selfinsurance and a whollyowned captive insurance entity additionally in 2021 we sponsored catastrophe bonds that provide further insurance coverage for potential losses resulting from earthquake risks in the us the costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through expense reimbursements from our customers we believe our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured see further discussion in item 1a risk factors

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition including but not limited to our financial position results of operations cash flow ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market value of our securities these risks relate to prologis as well as our investments in consolidated and unconsolidated entities and include among others i risks related to our global operations ii risks related to our business iii risks related to financing and capital iv risks related to income taxes and v general risks

 

risks related to our global operations

 

as a global company we are subject to social political and economic risks of doing business in many countries

 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the us during 2021 we generated approximately 620 million or 130 of our consolidated revenues from operations outside the us circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect us include but are not limited to the following factors

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

 



 



 



 



 

in addition we may be impacted by the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other factors

 

compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs

 

we are required to comply with many regulations in different countries including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar laws and regulations our properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as the americans with disabilities act and state and local fire lifesafety energy and greenhouse gas emissions requirements noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants while we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us

 

disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition

 

to the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect i the value of our properties ii the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing iii our ability to make principal and interest payments on or refinance any outstanding debt when due and iv the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect the market price of our securities and our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders

 

the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position

 

we hold significant real estate investments in international markets where the us dollar is not the functional currency at december 31 2021 approximately 91 billion or 156 of our total consolidated assets were invested in a currency other than the us dollar principally the british pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen for the year ended december 31 2021 422 million or 121 of our total consolidated segment noi was denominated in a currency other than the us dollar see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information on these amounts as a result we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our business and specifically our us dollar reported financial position and results of operations

 

our hedging of foreign currency and interest rate risk may not effectively limit our exposure to these risks

 

we attempt to mitigate our risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we have significant investments thereby providing a natural hedge we may also enter into derivative financial instruments that we designate as net investment hedges as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments we enter into other foreign currency contracts such as forwards to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flow associated with the translation of future earnings of our international subsidiaries although we attempt to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in foreign currency rates there can be no assurance that those attempts will be successful in addition we occasionally use interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate risk and limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency or interest rates and the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements the funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of the hedged foreign currency or the size of the underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of the breakage the failure to hedge effectively against foreign exchange changes or interest rate changes may adversely affect our business

 

 

 

risks related to our business

 

general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results

 

we are exposed to the economic conditions and other events and occurrences in the local regional national and international geographies in which we own properties our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties

 

at december 31 2021 307 of our consolidated operating properties or 138 billion based on consolidated gross book value or investment before depreciation were located in california central valley san francisco bay area and southern california markets which represented 259 of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 330 of our consolidated operating property noi our revenues from and the value of our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for logistics properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california’s economic climate because of the investment we have located in california a downturn in california’s economy or real estate conditions including state income tax and property tax laws could adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to california we also have significant holdings defined as more than 3 of total consolidated investment before depreciation in operating properties in certain markets located in atlanta chicago dallasfort worth houston lehigh valley new jerseynew york city seattle and south florida of these markets no single market contributed more than 10 of our total consolidated investment before depreciation in operating properties our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties conditions such as an oversupply of logistics space or a reduction in demand for logistics space among other factors may impact operating conditions any material oversupply of logistics space or material reduction in demand for logistics space could adversely affect our overall business 

 

our om portfolio which includes our consolidated properties and properties owned by our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures has concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above as well as in markets in china france japan mexico and the uk and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets which may reduce economic returns to investors

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as secured mortgage debt payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments as a reit under the irc we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable reit subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment to generate liquidity if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale we may not pursue such sales

 

we may decide to sell or contribute properties to certain of our coinvestment ventures or sell properties to third parties to generate proceeds to fund our capital deployment activities our ability to sell or contribute properties on advantageous terms is affected by i competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties ii economic and market conditions including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties and iii other factors beyond our control if our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or at all the coinvestment ventures or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital in the private and public markets in order to acquire properties from us should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then dispositions and contributions could be delayed 

 

if we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations sales or contributions of properties or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation divesting properties at less than optimal terms incurring debt entering into leases with new customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates there can be no assurance however that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us additionally taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our business and in particular our distributable cash flow and debt covenants

 

our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector

 

our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the logistics sector this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified

 

 

 

investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business

 

investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio market research and our asset management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated factors that may affect real estate values and cash flows include

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

these factors may affect our ability to recover our investment in the properties and result in impairment charges 

 

our customers may be unable to meet their lease obligations or we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or release space on favorable terms as leases expire

 

our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations at december 31 2021 our top 10 customers accounted for 167 of our consolidated ner and 140 of our om ner in the event of default by a significant number of customers we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord and we may be unable to release spaces a customer may experience a downturn in its business which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease in addition a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow 

 

we are also subject to the risk that upon the expiration of leases they may not be renewed by existing customers the space may not be released to new customers or the terms of renewal or releasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire or we may lose potential customers

 

we may acquire properties and companies that involve risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

 

we have acquired properties and will continue to acquire properties through the direct acquisition of real estate the acquisition of entities that own real estate or through additional investments in coinvestment ventures that acquire properties the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates when we acquire properties we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures additionally there is and it is expected there will continue to be significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities the acquired properties or entities may be subject to liabilities including tax liabilities which may be without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based on our new ownership of any of these entities or properties then we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it 

 

we may be unable to integrate the operations of newly acquired companies and realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits or do so within the anticipated timeframe potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include i the inability to dispose of nonindustrial assets or operations that are outside of our area of expertise ii potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses delays or regulatory conditions associated with these transactions and iii performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing these transactions and integrating the companies’ operations 

 

 

 

our real estate development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful

 

our real estate development and redevelopment strategy is focused on monetizing land and redevelopment sites in the future through development of logistics facilities to hold for longterm investment and for contribution or sale to a coinvestment venture or third party depending on market conditions our liquidity needs and other factors we may increase our investment in the development renovation and redevelopment business and we expect to complete the buildout and leasing of our current development portfolio we may also develop renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed coinvestment ventures the real estate development renovation and redevelopment business includes the following significant risks

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming and attracting thirdparty investment in coinvestment ventures investing in new or existing coinvestment ventures and managing properties through coinvestment ventures

 

at december 31 2021 we had investments in coinvestment ventures both public and private that owned operating properties with a gross book value of approximately 54 billion our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in these ventures and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through coinvestment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances however there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new coinvestment ventures or attract thirdparty investment or that additional investments in new or existing ventures to develop or acquire properties will be successful further there can be no assurance that we are able to realize value from our existing or future investments the same factors that impact the valuation of our consolidated portfolio as discussed above also impact the portfolios held by the coinvestment ventures and could result in other than temporary impairment of our investment and a reduction in fee revenues 

 

our coinvestment ventures involve certain additional risks that we do not otherwise face including

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our coinvestment ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives however we may not be able to continue to do so indefinitely we have formed publicly traded investment vehicles such as npr and fibra prologis for which we serve as sponsor or manager these entities bear their own risks related to trading markets foreign currency exchange rates and market demand we have contributed and may continue to contribute assets into such vehicles there is a risk that our managerial relationship may be terminated 

 

we have also made investments in early and growthstage companies that are focused on emerging technology these companies may not be successful at raising additional capital or generating cash flows to sustain operations which could result in the impairment of our investment in addition through prologis essentials we are investing in the development of new business lines that are complementary to our core business these business lines may not be successful and may include risks that are different than investing in our core real estate business

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition

 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination

 

environmental laws in some countries including the us also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of our properties are known to contain asbestoscontaining building materials

 

in addition some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances furthermore certain of our properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in connection with certain divested properties we have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties

 

our insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses 

 

we and our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy namely windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets we believe our properties and the properties of our coinvestment ventures are adequately insured certain losses however including losses from floods earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots and pandemics generally are not insured against or not fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property

 

furthermore we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties and if there is recourse debt then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our business 

 

 

 

a number of our investments both whollyowned and owned through coinvestment ventures are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity us properties located in active seismic areas include properties in our markets in california and seattle international properties located in active seismic areas include japan and mexico we generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to selfinsure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis we have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for our assets in japan based on this analysis

 

furthermore a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane or flood risk we carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants

 

risks related to financing and capital

 

we may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments

 

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and if the maturing debt is secured the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness our credit facilities and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates increases in market interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements

 

covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition

 

the terms of our various credit agreements including our credit facilities and term loans the indentures under which certain of our senior notes are issued and other note agreements require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage ratios leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios these covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness if we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations our business and financial condition generally and in particular the amount of our distributable cash flow could be adversely affected 

 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity

 

at december 31 2021 our credit ratings were a3 from moody’s with a stable outlook and a from sp with a positive outlook a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization

 

the credit ratings of our senior notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing also a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our credit facilities and other debt instruments adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and in particular our refinancing and other capital market activities our ability to manage debt maturities our future growth and our development and acquisition activity

 

in order to meet reit distribution requirements we may need access to external sources of capital

 

to qualify as a reit we are required each year to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders and we may be subject to tax to the extent our taxable income is not fully distributed historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders however we may elect to pay a portion of the distribution in shares of our stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital furthermore to maintain our reit status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all depends on a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities

 

 

transition to an alternative reference rate due to the cessation of the london interbank offered rate “libor” could have a negative impact on our required debt payments and the value of our related debt and derivative financial instruments

 

in march 2021 the financial conduct authority “fca” formally announced that the publication of libor was ending and confirmed that usd liborindexed rates would cease to be published after june 30 2023 certain interbank offered rates “ibor” ceased on december 31 2021 for discussion on the transition of these rates see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as its preferred alternative rate for usd libor for debt and derivative financial instruments this extended cessation date for usd liborindexed rates would allow most legacy usd libor contracts to mature before disruptions occur in the usd libor market without the need to transition those contracts to sofr at december 31 2021 only the available usd commitments on our global senior credit facilities were indexed to usd libor see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional discussion regarding our variable rate debt

 

our global senior credit facility agreements contain provisions that reference a comparable or successor rate to the extent usd libor rates are no longer available and no mandatory prepayment or redemption provisions would be triggered in that instance we anticipate managing the transition from usd libor to sofr using the language set out in our agreements and through potentially modifying our debt and derivative instruments however future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications and we may incur significant associated costs in doing so we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact on our debt payments and value of our related debt and derivative financial instruments

 

our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock or units in the op

 

any additional future issuance of common stock or op units will reduce the percentage of our common stock and units owned by investors in most circumstances stockholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock or units in addition depending on the terms and pricing of any additional offering of our common stock or op units and the utilization of the proceeds our stockholders and unitholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock or units

 

risks related to income tax

 

the failure of prologis inc to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences

 

prologis inc elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the irc commencing with the taxable year ended december 31 1997 we believe prologis inc has been organized and operated to qualify as a reit under the irc and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the irc to enable prologis inc to continue to qualify as a reit however it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow prologis inc to qualify as a reit or that our future operations could cause prologis inc to fail to qualify qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some annually and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex sections of the irc for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control for example to qualify as a reit prologis inc must derive at least 95 of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition prologis inc must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders but we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances our own stock the provisions of the irc and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a reit are more complicated for prologis inc because we hold substantially all of our assets through the op

 

if prologis inc fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be required to pay federal income tax including for taxable years prior to 2018 any applicable alternative minimum tax on taxable income at regular corporate rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions prologis inc would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it lost the qualification and would be subject to corporate tax on builtin gains that exist at the time of reit reelection if recognized within the fiveyear period after reelection and potentially 10 years for certain states if prologis inc lost its reit status our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved in addition we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment operations and distributions would be reduced

 

furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits that elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the irc provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit 95 and 75 gross income tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to us federal income tax in addition a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect on the ability of prologis inc to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus its ability to qualify as a reit

 

 

in addition we may acquire properties through the acquisition of reit entities that own the real estate if a gain in such assets is not otherwise recognized by the seller or target in such acquisitions and such entities were to fail to satisfy the reit requirements for any year they would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the reit qualification was lost and the acquired assets would be subject to corporate tax on builtin gains that exist at the time of reit reelection or if earlier at the time of prologis’ acquisition of the assets a sale of such assets within the 5year recognition period and potentially 10 years for certain states could result in corporate tax liabilities that could be significant 

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction

 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties including by contributing properties to our coinvestment ventures under the irc any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service “irs” may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions while we believe that the irs would not prevail in any such dispute if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

 

legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us

 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the us state local and foreign income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate reits similar entities and investments additional changes are likely to continue to occur in the future both in and outside of the us and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders any increases in tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes

 

complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities

 

our use of taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the irc no more than 20 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities

 

general risks

 

our business may be materially and adversely affected by the impact of the global pandemic of covid19 

the world health organization and certain national and local governments characterized covid19 as a pandemic in march 2020 the covid19 outbreak has disrupted financial markets and global national and local economies there are government restrictions on activities across the globe the impact of the covid19 outbreak on our business that of our coinvestment ventures and our customers for the longterm continues to be uncertain

 

given the ongoing and dynamic nature of these circumstances we cannot predict the extent to which the continuation of the covid19 pandemic may impact our business and operating results and that of our coinvestment ventures but its impact may include the following

 



 



 



 



 



 

 

 

any prolonged economic downturn escalation of the outbreak or disruption in the financial markets may also impact our ability to access capital markets to issue debt or equity securities and to complete real estate transactions at attractive pricing or at all

 

these items may materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and real estate values

 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks

 

despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks such as malware ransomware or unauthorized access any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business we may incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions thirdparty security events at vendors subprocessors and service providers could also impact our data and operations via unauthorized access to information or disruption of services which may ultimately result in financial losses despite training detection systems and response procedures an increase in email attacks phishing and business email compromise may create disruption to our business and financial risk

 

although security incidents have had an insignificant financial impact on our operating results the growing frequency of attempts may lead to increased costs to protect the company and respond to any events including additional personnel consultants and protection technologies any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws unauthorized access to information of ours and others significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business additionally remediation costs for security events may not be covered by our insurance

 

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel

 

we depend on the deep industry knowledge and the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees from time to time our personnel and their roles may change while we believe that we are able to retain our key talent and find suitable employees to meet our needs the loss of key personnel any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our business if we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected

 

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting

 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements or a decline in the price of our securities

 

we are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and could be required to implement new or stricter regulations which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition

 

we are also exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate our logistics facilities may be exposed to catastrophic weather events such as severe storms fires or floods if the frequency of extreme weather events increases our exposure to these events could increase we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain or stricter energy efficiency standards or greenhouse gas regulations for the commercial building sectors we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the potential impacts of future climate change on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral

management’s overview

 

summary of 2021

 

our financial condition and operating results were strong during 2021 ecommerce continues to grow well above its historical average and demand for space is robust based on our proprietary data as demand surges having the right logistics real estate in the right location is mission critical for our customers which is evident with our om occupancy at 977 at december 31 2021 leasing activity accelerated for our portfolio during 2021 our outlook for 2022 is equally as promising as we expect increases in market rents and asset valuations to drive our operating results as well as our execution of profitable deployment activities

 

we generated net proceeds of 52 billion and realized net gains of 16 billion principally from the contribution of properties to our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures in japan europe and the us and dispositions to third parties

 

we earned promotes aggregating 98 million 43 million net of related expenses primarily during the fourth quarter of 2021 from one of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures in europe

 

in december 2021 uklv sold its operating properties to our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures pelf and pelp and its land to us 

 

 

 

we completed the following consolidated financing activities that included the issuance of 29 billion and redemption of 15 billion of senior notes with aggregate principal amounts in us dollars this resulted in a consolidated weighted average remaining maturity of 10 years and lowered our weighted average effective interest rate to 16 at december 31 2021 principal in millions

 



 



 



 



 

at december 31 2021 we had total available liquidity of 50 billion principally due to aggregate availability under our credit facilities of 44 billion and unrestricted cash balances of 556 million in april 2021 we increased our available liquidity by entering into a second global senior credit facility with an available borrowing capacity of 10 billion and we terminated the 500 million multicurrency term loan

 

results of operations 

 

we evaluate our business operations based on the noi of our two operating segments real estate operations and strategic capital noi by segment is a nongaap performance measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements we consider noi by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps management and investors understand our operating results 

 

below is a reconciliation of our noi by segment to operating income per the consolidated financial statements in millions each segment’s noi is reconciled to line items in the consolidated financial statements as provided in the related discussion below

 



see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our segments and a reconciliation of each business segment’s noi to operating income and earnings before income taxes 

 

real estate operations

 

this operating segment principally includes rental revenue and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties we allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses 

 

and the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios in addition this segment is impacted by our development acquisition and disposition activities 

 

below are the components of real estate operations noi derived directly from line items in the consolidated financial statements in millions

 



 

the change in real estate operations “reo” noi in 2021 compared to 2020 of approximately 285 million was impacted by the following activities in millions 

 

 



 



 



 

below are key operating metrics of our consolidated operating portfolio which excludes nonstrategic industrial properties 

 

 

 

 



 



 

development activity

 

the following table summarizes consolidated development activity dollars and square feet in millions

 



 



 



 

at december 31 2021 the consolidated development portfolio including properties under development and prestabilized properties was expected to be completed before october 2023 with a tei of 47 billion leaving 20 billion remaining to be spent and was 546 leased while construction costs increased during 2021 we continue to maintain high margins as a result of lower capitalization rates and higher market rents our current investment in the development portfolio was 27 billion and we expect our development activities to increase in 2022 for additional information on our development portfolio at december 31 2021 see item 2 properties

 

 

 

capital expenditures

 

we capitalize costs incurred in improving and leasing our operating properties as part of the investment basis or within other assets the following graph summarizes capitalized expenditures excluding development costs and property improvements per average square foot of our consolidated operating properties during each year

 

 

our capital expenditures continue to increase year over year as we grow the consolidated operating portfolio through development stabilizations and acquisitions we plan to continue allocating capital in 2022 to renovate and modernize our operating portfolio including the addition of sustainable and efficient building features 

 

strategic capital

 

this operating segment includes revenues from asset management and property management services performed transactional services for acquisition disposition and leasing activity and promote revenue earned from the unconsolidated entities revenues associated with the strategic capital segment fluctuate because of changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions the fair value of the properties and other transactional activity including foreign currency exchange rates and timing of promotes these revenues are reduced by the direct costs associated with the asset and propertylevel management expenses for the properties owned by these ventures we allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses and to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios for further details regarding the key property information and summarized financial condition and operating results of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements

 

below are the components of strategic capital noi derived directly from the line items in the consolidated financial statements in millions 

 



below is additional detail of our strategic capital revenues expenses and noi in millions

 





 



 



 

 

 



 

ga expenses

 

ga expenses were 294 million and 275 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively ga expenses increased in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to higher compensation expenses based largely on our outperformance and the increase in our share price we capitalize certain internal costs including salaries and related expenses directly related primarily to our development activities for discussion on our longterm incentive plans refer to the proxy statement for our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders

 

the following table summarizes capitalized ga in millions 

 



 

depreciation and amortization expenses

 

depreciation and amortization expenses were 16 billion in both 2021 and 2020

 

the change in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2021 compared to 2020 of approximately 16 million was impacted by the following activities in millions 

 

 



 

gains on real estate transactions net

 

gains on the disposition of development properties and land were 817 million and 465 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively and primarily included gains from the contribution of properties we developed to our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures in japan the us and europe gains on other dispositions of investments in real estate were 773 million and 252 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively which included sales of operating properties including certain nonstrategic assets acquired in the liberty transaction and the ipt transaction the contribution of operating properties to our unconsolidated coinvestment venture in the us and the sale of our ownership interest in other unconsolidated ventures we utilized the proceeds from these transactions primarily to fund our development activities during both periods see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these transactions

 

 

 

our owned and managed “om” operating portfolio

 

we manage our business and review our operating fundamentals on an om basis which includes our consolidated properties and properties owned by our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures we believe reviewing the fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact to the financial statements as it will affect both the real estate operations and strategic capital segments as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures based on our ownership we do not control the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures for purposes of gaap and the presentation of the ventures’ operating information does not represent a legal claim 

 

our om operating portfolio does not include our development portfolio valueadded properties nonindustrial properties or properties we do not have the intent to hold longterm that are classified as either held for sale or within other real estate investments valueadded properties are properties we have either acquired at a discount and believe we could provide greater returns poststabilization or properties we expect to repurpose to a higher and better use see below for information on our om operating portfolio at december 31 square feet in millions

 



 

below are the key leasing metrics of our om operating portfolio

 

 



 



 

same store analysis

 

our same store metrics are nongaap financial measures which are commonly used in the real estate industry and expected from the financial community on both a net effective and cash basis we evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period which allows us and investors to analyze our ongoing business operations we determine our same store metrics on property noi which is calculated as rental revenue less rental expense for the applicable properties in the same store population for both consolidated and unconsolidated properties based on our ownership interest as further defined below

 

we define our same store population for the three months ended december 31 2021 as the properties in our om operating portfolio including the property noi for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures at january 1 2020 and owned throughout the same threemonth period in both 2020 and 2021 we believe the drivers of property noi for the consolidated portfolio are generally the same for the properties owned by the ventures in which we invest and therefore we evaluate the same store metrics of the om portfolio based on prologis’ ownership in the properties “prologis share” the same store population excludes properties held for sale to third parties along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period january 1 2020 and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period to derive an appropriate measure of periodtoperiod operating performance we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the reported periodend exchange rate to translate from local currency into the us dollar for both periods

 

 

as nongaap financial measures the same store metrics have certain limitations as an analytical tool and may vary among real estate companies as a result we provide a reconciliation of rental revenues less rental expenses “property noi” from our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap to our same store property noi measures

 

we evaluate the results of our same store portfolio on a quarterly basis the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues rental expenses and property noi for each quarter in 2021 and 2020 to the full year as included in the consolidated statements of income and within note 19 to the consolidated financial statements and to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended december 31 dollars in millions

 



 



 



 



 

during the periods presented certain wholly owned properties were contributed to a coinvestment venture and are included in the same store portfolio neither our consolidated results nor those of the coinvestment ventures when viewed individually 

 

would be comparable on a same store basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period eg the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the venture subsequent to the contribution date based on our ownership interest at the end of the period as a result only line items labeled “prologis share of same store property noi” are comparable period over period 

 



 

we manage our business and compensate our executives based on the same store results of our om portfolio at 100 as we manage our portfolio on an ownership blind basis we calculate those results by including 100 of the properties included in our same store portfolio

 

other components of income expense

 

earnings from unconsolidated entities net

 

we recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities which are accounted for using the equity method of 404 million and 297 million during 2021 and 2020 respectively included in 2021 is our share of the gains recognized upon the sale of certain nonstrategic assets acquired in the ipt transaction and the sale by uklv of its operating properties to our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures pelf and pelp 

 

the earnings we recognize can be impacted by i variances in revenues and expenses of each venture ii the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture iii gains or losses from the dispositions of properties and extinguishment of debt iv our ownership interest in each venture and v fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to us dollars see the discussion of our unconsolidated entities above in the strategic capital segment discussion and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized

 

interest expense

 

the following table details our net interest expense dollars in millions

 



 

although our debt balances have increased interest expense decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to our refinancing activities to redeem higher interest rate senior notes before their stated maturities as a result of these activities we lowered the consolidated weighted average effective interest rate on our senior notes from 24 on january 1 2020 to 17 on december 31 2021 while extending the weighted average remaining maturity of our senior notes from 8 to 12 years over the same twoyear period

 

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section below for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs

 

foreign currency and derivative gains losses net

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our earnings we recognize the change in fair value of the undesignated derivative contracts in unrealized gains and losses upon settlement of these transactions we recognize realized gains or losses 

 

we primarily hedge our foreign currency risk related to our investments by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge we have issued debt in a currency that is not the same functional currency of the borrowing entity and have designated a portion of the debt as a nonderivative net investment hedge we recognize the remeasurement and settlement of the translation adjustment on the unhedged portion of the debt and accrued interest in unrealized gains or losses 

 

 

the following table details our foreign currency and derivative gains losses net included in earnings in millions

 



 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative financial instrument policies and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our derivative and nonderivative transactions

 

losses on early extinguishment of debt net

 

we recognized 187 million and 188 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt in 2021 and 2020 respectively the losses during both periods were driven by the redemption of certain higher interest rate senior notes before their stated maturity we compare any prepayment penalties incurred from the early redemption of the borrowings to the potential interest savings over the term and make a decision to refinance the debt when it is economically viable we redeemed 15 billion of senior notes with stated maturities of 2024 and 2025 in 2021 and 26 billion of senior notes with stated maturities between 2021 and 2024 in 2020 the losses in 2020 also included the extinguishment of debt assumed in the liberty transaction and the ipt transaction which represented the excess of the prepayment penalties over the premium recorded upon assumption of the debt see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section for more information regarding our debt repurchases

 

income tax expense

 

we recognize income tax expense related to our taxable reit subsidiaries and in the local state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income including gains on the disposition of properties and fees earned from the coinvestment ventures deferred income tax expense benefit is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries

 

the following table summarizes our income tax expense benefit in millions

 



 

our income taxes are discussed in more detail in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests

 

this amount represents the thirdparty investors’ share of the earnings generated in consolidated entities in which we do not own 100 of the equity reduced by the thirdparty share of fees or promotes payable to us and earned during the period we had net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of 209 million and 135 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively included in these amounts were 82 million and 42 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively of net earnings attributable to the common limited partnership unitholders of prologis lp the recognition of net gains on the sale of the nonstrategic assets identified for disposition in the ipt transaction also increased the net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2021 

 

 

 

see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncontrolling interests

 

other comprehensive income loss 

 

the key driver of changes in accumulated other comprehensive income loss “aocil” in 2021 and 2020 was the currency translation adjustment derived from changes in exchange rates during both periods primarily on our net investments in real estate outside the us and the borrowings we issue in the functional currencies of the countries where we invest these borrowings serve as a natural hedge of our foreign investments in addition we use derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign investments that when designated the change in fair value is included in aocil 

 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative financial instrument policies and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our derivative and nonderivative transactions and other comprehensive income loss

liquidity and capital resources

 

overview

 

we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities distributions from our coinvestment ventures contributions and dispositions of properties and available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development acquisition operating debt service dividend and distribution requirements

 

nearterm principal cash sources and uses

 

in addition to dividends and distributions we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we expect to fund our cash needs principally from the following sources subject to market conditions

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

 

 

longterm we may also have a primary cash need related to the voluntary repurchase of our outstanding debt or equity securities depending on prevailing market conditions our liquidity contractual restrictions and other factors through cash purchases openmarket purchases privately negotiated transactions tender offers or otherwise we may also fund our cash needs from the issuance of equity securities subject to market conditions and the sale of a portion of our investments in coinvestment ventures to achieve longterm ownership targets

 

debt

 

the following table summarizes information about our consolidated debt by currency at december 31 dollars in millions 

 



 



 

our credit ratings at december 31 2021 were a3 from moody’s with a stable outlook and a from standard  poor’s with a positive outlook these ratings allow us to borrow at an advantageous interest rate adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and in particular our refinancing and other capital market activities our ability to manage debt maturities our future growth and our development and acquisition activity a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization

 

at december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants these covenants include a number of customary financial covenants  such as maintaining debt service coverage ratios leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios 

 

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our debt

 

equity commitments related to certain coinvestment ventures

 

certain coinvestment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash we may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash 

 

the following table summarizes the remaining equity commitments at december 31 2021 in millions

 



 



 



 

see the cash flow summary below for more information about our investment activity in our coinvestment ventures 

 

 

 

cash flow summary 

 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity in millions

 



 

operating activities

 

cash provided by and used in operating activities exclusive of changes in receivables and payables was impacted by the following significant activities

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

investing activities

 

cash provided by investing activities is driven by proceeds from contributions and dispositions of real estate during 2021 our dispositions included significant contributions of properties we developed to our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures as well as the sale of operating properties cash used in investing activities is primarily driven by our capital deployment activities of investing in real estate development acquisitions and capital expenditures during 2021 our acquisitions included significant acquisitions of land for future development operating properties and other real estate assets including covered land plays to support increased development activities in the future see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these activities in addition the following significant transactions also impacted our cash used in and provided by investing activities 





 



 



 



 



 

financing activities

 

cash provided by and used in financing activities is principally driven by proceeds from and payments on credit facilities and other debt along with dividends paid on common and preferred stock and noncontrolling interest contributions and distributions 

 



 

our repurchase of and payments on debt and proceeds from the issuance of debt consisted of the following activity in millions

 



 



 

unconsolidated coinvestment venture debt

 

we had investments in and advances to our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures of 78 billion at december 31 2021 these ventures listed below had total thirdparty debt of 120 billion at december 31 2021 with a weighted average remaining maturity of 7 years and weighted average interest rate of 22  certain of our ventures do not have thirdparty debt and are therefore excluded this debt is nonrecourse to prologis and other investors in the coinvestment ventures and bears interest as follows at december 31 2021 dollars in millions 

 



 



 

at december 31 2021 we did not guarantee any thirdparty debt of the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures in our role as the manager or sponsor we work with the coinvestment ventures to maintain sufficient liquidity and refinance their maturing debt there can be no assurance that the coinvestment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the 

 

maturing debt or at all if the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets certain of our ventures also have credit facilities or unencumbered properties both of which may be used to obtain funds 

 

dividend and distribution requirements

 

our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the irc relative to maintaining our reit status while still allowing us to retain cash to fund our capital deployment and other investment activities 

 

under the irc reits may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income

 

we paid quarterly cash dividends of 063 and 058 per common share in 2021 and 2020 respectively our future common stock dividends if and as declared may vary and will be determined by the board based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time including our financial condition operating results and reit distribution requirements and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year

 

we make distributions on the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend the class a units in the op are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to 064665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least 040 per unit we paid a quarterly cash distribution of 064665 per class a unit in 2021 and 2020 

 

at december 31 2021 our series q preferred stock had an annual dividend rate of 854 per share and the dividends are payable quarterly in arrears

 

pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock

 

other commitments

 

on an ongoing basis we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties 

 

critical accounting policies

 

a critical accounting policy is one that involves an estimate or assumption that is subjective and requires management judgment about the effect of a matter that is inherently uncertain and material to an entity’s financial condition and results of operations management’s judgment considers historical and current economic conditions and expectations for the future changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance of the significant accounting policies discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements those presented below have been identified by us as meeting the criteria to be considered critical accounting policies as they relate to our financial condition as of the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 and our operating results for the threeyear period ended december 31 2021 refer to note 2 for more information on these critical accounting policies

 

asset acquisitions

 

we generally account for an acquisition of a single property or portfolio of properties as an asset acquisition we measure the real estate assets acquired through an asset acquisition based on their cost or total consideration exchanged and any excess consideration or bargain purchase amount is allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis assets we do not intend to hold longterm are recorded at fair value at a propertylevel we allocate the fair value to the components which include building land improvements and intangible assets or liabilities related to acquired leases the most significant portion of the allocation is to building and land and requires the use of market based estimates and assumptions

 

the purchase price allocation is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located utilizing an income approach methodology which may be a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated noi of a property key assumptions include market rents growth rates and discount and capitalization rates estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results known trends and market and economic conditions we determine discount and capitalization rates by market based on recent transactions and other market data and adjust if necessary based on the property characteristics the fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale the use of different assumptions to value the acquired properties and allocate the most significant portion of the property value between the building and land could affect the expenses we recognize over the estimated remaining useful life

 

 

recoverability of real estate assets

 

we assess the carrying values of our respective longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable this assessment is primarily triggered based on the shortening of the expected hold period due to our change in intent to sell a property in the near term we have processes to monitor our intent with regard to our investments and the estimated disposition value in comparison to the current carrying value if our assessment of potential triggering events indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to sell in the near term is not recoverable we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property we determine the fair value of the property based on the proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on quoted market values thirdparty appraisals or discounted cash flow models that utilize the future noi of the property and expected market capitalization rates the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business changes in economic and operating conditions could impact our intent and the assumptions used in determining the fair value that could result in future impairment

 

new accounting pronouncements

 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

 

funds from operations attributable to common stockholdersunitholders “ffo”

 

ffo is a nongaap financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings

 

the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales net of any related tax along with impairment charges of previously depreciated properties we also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties we exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties’ share of our consolidated coinvestment ventures

 

our ffo measures

 

our ffo measures begin with nareit’s definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy while not infrequent or unusual the additional items we adjust for in calculating ffo as modified by prologis and core ffo  both as defined below are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term these items have both positive and negative shortterm effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our longterm outlook

 

we calculate our ffo measures as defined below based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures we reflect our share of our ffo measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our ffo measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods

 

these ffo measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses we do not use our ffo measures as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap as indicators of our operating performance as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs

 

we analyze our operating performance principally by the rental revenue of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business net of operating administrative and financing expenses this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities

 

ffo as modified by prologis attributable to common stockholdersunitholders “ffo as modified by prologis”

 

to arrive at ffo as modified by prologis  we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax specifically

 



 



 



 



 

we use ffo as modified by prologis  so that management analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other reits that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the us

 

core ffo attributable to common stockholdersunitholders “core ffo”

 

in addition to ffo as modified by prologis  we also use core ffo to arrive at core ffo we adjust ffo as modified by prologis  to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognize directly in ffo as modified by prologis 

 



 



 



 



 



 

we use core ffo  including by segment and region to i assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies ii evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods iii evaluate the performance of our management iv budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources v provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance and vi evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results

 

limitations on the use of our ffo measures

 

while we believe our modified ffo measures are important supplemental measures neither nareit’s nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are therefore limited as an analytical tool accordingly these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business some of the limitations are

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

 

 

we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions this information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap to assist investors in compensating for these limitations we reconcile our modified ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap as follows in millions

 



 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to the impact of foreign exchangerelated variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments and interest rate changes see our risk factors in item 1a risk factors specifically risks related to our global operations and risks related to financing and capital see also notes 2 and 15 in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information about our foreign operations and derivative financial instruments

 

we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates at december 31 2021 the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following sections the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value as a result revenues and expenses as well as our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates

 

foreign currency risk

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange variability related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our results of operations or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge additionally we hedge our foreign currency risk by entering into derivative financial instruments that we designate as net investment hedges as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments at december 31 2021 after consideration of our ability to borrow in the foreign currencies in which we invest and also derivative and nonderivative financial instruments as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we had minimal net equity denominated in a currency other than the us dollar

 

for the year ended december 31 2021 573 million or 120 of our total consolidated revenue was denominated in foreign currencies we enter into other foreign currency contracts such as forwards to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency associated with the translation of the future earnings of our international subsidiaries we have forward contracts that were not designated as hedges denominated principally in british pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen and have an aggregate notional amount of 17 billion to mitigate risk associated with the translation of the future earnings of our subsidiaries denominated in these currencies the gain or loss on settlement of these contracts is included in our earnings and offsets the lower or higher translation of earnings from our investments denominated in currencies other than the us dollar although the impact to net earnings is mitigated through higher 

 

translated us dollar earnings from these currencies a weakening of the us dollar against these c urrencies by 10 c ould result in a  166 million cash payment on settlement of these contracts  

 

interest rate risk

 

we are also exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows to mitigate that risk we generally borrow with fixed rate debt and we may use derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on our variable rate debt at december 31 2021 159 billion of our debt bore interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments was affected by changes in market interest rates at december 31 2021 19 billion of our debt bore interest at variable rates the following table summarizes the future repayment of debt and scheduled principal payments at december 31 2021 dollars in millions

 



 



 



 

at december 31 2021 the weighted average effective interest rate on our variable rate debt was 05 changes in interest rates can cause interest expense to fluctuate on our variable rate debt on the basis of our sensitivity analysis a 10 increase in interest rates on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances would result in additional annual interest expense of 1 million for the year ended december 31 2021 which equates to a change in interest rates of 5 basis points on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances and less than 1 basis point on our average total debt portfolio balances

the company

 

we are the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on highbarrier high growth markets we own manage and develop welllocated highquality logistics facilities in 19 countries across four continents our local teams actively manage our portfolio which encompasses leasing property management capital deployment and opportunistic dispositions our disposition activities allow us to recycle capital and largely selffund our development and acquisition activities the majority of our properties in the united states “us” are wholly owned while our international properties are primarily held in our coinvestment ventures which has the benefit of mitigating our exposure to foreign currency movements

 

our portfolio is focused on the world’s most vibrant centers of commerce and our scale allows us to respond to our customers’ needs for the highestquality buildings across these locations there is an emergence of two new structural demand drivers for our real estate i the need for more inventory as supply chains emphasize resilience over efficiency and ii the acceleration of ecommerce adoption 

as service time increasingly moves to the forefront of the global supply chain it drives demand for logistics real estate close to the end  consumer we have invested in properties located withi n infill and urban areas in our largest global markets with same day access defined as last touch ®  and next day access defined as city distribution   to the consumer population this positioning gives us the unique ability to provide our customers with the right real estate solutions for their supply chains that in turn  allows them to meet end c onsumer delivery expectations 

 

as we look to the future of logistics real estate we are focused on solving our customers’ pain points innovating in pursuit of creative solutions and operational excellence we are listening and responding to our customers’ needs for skilled labor through initiatives to create community workforce programs to develop their talent pool utilize our proprietary data and analytics to ensure efficient distribution solutions and negotiate better pricing on common products and services that our customers need our customers turn to us because they know that a strategic partnership with prologis is a competitive advantage we accomplish all of this by employing individuals who continue to grow embrace change and draw strength from inclusion and diversity

 

at december 31 2020 we owned or had investments in properties on a whollyowned basis or through ventures in the following geographies dollars in billions based on gross book value and total expected investment as defined below and square feet in millions

 

 

2020 significant events

 

on january 8 2020 our two us coinvestment ventures prologis us logistics venture llc “uslv” and prologis targeted us logistics fund “uslf” acquired the whollyowned real estate assets of industrial property trust inc “ipt” for approximately 20 billion each which we refer to as the “ipt transaction” and is detailed in notes 4 5 8 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements the portfolio included 235 properties aggregating 37 million square feet and were highly complementary to our us portfolio in terms of product quality location and growth potential our aggregate investment in the ipt transaction was 16 billion

 

on february 4 2020 we acquired liberty property trust and liberty property limited partnership collectively “liberty” through a merger transaction that we refer to as the “liberty transaction” and is detailed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements the liberty portfolio was primarily comprised of logistics real estate assets including 519 operating properties aggregating 100 million square feet and were highly complementary to our us portfolio in terms of product quality location and growth potential the portfolio also included properties under development land for future development and office properties the acquisition expanded our presence in target markets such as lehigh valley chicago houston central pennsylvania new jersey and southern california the total acquisition price including transaction costs was approximately 13 billion and was funded through the issuance of equity and the assumption of debt as a result of the closely aligned portfolios and similar business strategy we integrated the ipt and liberty properties while adding minimal property management and general and administrative expenses further scaling our operations

 

on a combined basis there were 42 million square feet of nonstrategic industrial properties with a gross book value of approximately 3 billion acquired in both the liberty transaction and the ipt transaction that we do not intend to operate longterm  depending on the expected hold period these assets were either classified as assets held for sale or contribution or other real estate investments within investments in real estate properties at the time of acquisition in the consolidated balance sheets since acquisition some of these nonstrategic industrial properties have been sold

 

in early 2020 covid19 was characterized as a global pandemic by the world health organization the covid19 outbreak has disrupted financial markets and global national and local economies since this time our operating results have remained strong in the covid19 environment and our business has been resilient we expect operating conditions in our portfolio to continue to strengthen in 2021 however with the continued uncertainty across the globe we cannot predict the impact on our business future financial condition or operating results for discussion on current operating results and our operational and financial outlook as well as our response to help protect employees and customers see the summary of 2020 section in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

throughout this discussion we reflect amounts in us dollars our reporting currency included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies principally the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated to us dollars we mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by investing outside the us through coinvestment ventures borrowing in the functional currency of our subsidiaries and utilizing derivative financial instruments

 

operating segments

 

our business comprises two operating segments real estate operations and strategic capital 

 

below is information summarizing consolidated activity within our segments over the last three years in millions 

 

 



 



 

 

real estate operations

 

rental rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contribute 85 to 90 of our consolidated revenues earnings and funds from operations “ffo” we collect rent from our customers through operating leases including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs we expect to generate internal growth by increasing rents maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses the primary driver of our revenue growth will be rolling inplace leases to current market rents as leases expire we believe our active portfolio management combined with the skills of our property leasing maintenance capital energy sustainability and risk management teams allow us to maximize noi across our portfolio a majority of our consolidated rental revenue noi and cash flows are generated in the us 

 

development given the scarcity of modern logistics facilities in our target markets our development business provides us the opportunity to build what our customers need we develop properties to meet these needs deepen our market presence and maintain a modern portfolio we believe we have a competitive advantage due to i the strategic locations of our land bank and redevelopment sites ii the development expertise of our local teams and iii the depth of our customer relationships successful development and redevelopment efforts provide significant earnings growth as projects are leased generate income and increase the net asset value of our real estate operations segment based on our current estimates our consolidated land including options has the potential to support the development of 118 billion of tei of new logistics space in addition to our land portfolio we have also made investments in other properties that have the potential to be redeveloped to increase value generally we develop properties in the us for longterm hold and outside the us for contribution to our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures 

 

strategic capital

 

our strategic capital segment allows us to partner with many of the world’s largest institutional investors and capitalize our business through private equity principally perpetual openended or longterm ventures we also access capital in this segment through two publicly traded vehicles nippon prologis reit inc in japan and fibra prologis in mexico we align our interests with our partners by holding significant ownership interests in all of our 9 unconsolidated coinvestment ventures ranging from 15 to 50 which allows us to reduce our exposure to foreign currency movements for investments outside the us 

 

this segment produces stable longterm cash flows and generally contributes 10 to 15 of our recurring consolidated revenues earnings and ffo we generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures principally through asset and property management services we earn additional revenues by providing leasing acquisition construction development and disposition services in certain ventures we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees “promotes” or “promote revenues” periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation we plan to profitably grow this business by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures most of the strategic capital revenues are generated outside the us noi in this segment is calculated directly from our consolidated financial statements as strategic capital revenues less strategic capital expenses and excludes propertyrelated noi

 

future growth

 

we believe the quality and scale of our global portfolio the expertise of our team the depth of our customer relationships and the strength of our balance sheet give us unique competitive advantages to grow revenues noi earnings ffo and cash flows

 

 



 



 



 



 



 





 

competition 

 

real estate ownership is highly fragmented and we therefore face competition from many owners and operators competitively priced logistics space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge which in turn could affect our operating results we may face competition regarding our capital deployment activities including local regional and national operators or developers we also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business

 

despite the competition we may face our strategic focus over the years has given us distinct competitive advantages including the following

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

customers

 

our broad customer base represents a spectrum of international national regional and local logistics users at december 31 2020 in our real estate operations segment representing our consolidated properties we had more than 3400 customers occupying 446 million square feet of logistics operating properties 

 

 

in order to provide for a customercentric location strategy we have invested in properties located within infill and urban areas in our largest global markets with same day and next day access to the consumer population these are our last touch ® and city distribution facilities respectively to support these distribution facilities we utilize multimarket facilities located at key transportation hubs on the edge of these major infill and urban areas and gateway distribution facilities that incorporate access to major sea and intermodal ports below are the primary categories of goods in our buildings for our consolidated real estate properties at december 31 2020 

 

 

 



 

the following table details our top 25 customers for our consolidated real estate properties at december 31 2020 square feet in millions

 



 

 

in our strategic capital segment we view our partners and investors as our customers at december 31 2020 we had approximately 128 investors in our private equity ventures several of which invest in multiple ventures

 

employees 

 

we believe our employees are the most important part of our business when attracting developing and retaining talent we seek individuals who hold varied experiences and viewpoints to create an inclusive and diverse culture and workplace that allows each employee to do their best work and drive our collective success we focus on leadership development at every level of the organization we align employees’ goals with our overall strategic direction to create a clear link between individual efforts and the longterm success of the company and then provide effective feedback on their performance towards goals to ensure their growth we believe a commitment to our employees’ learning and development through training educational opportunities and mentorship is critical to our ability to continue to innovate through performance plans talent recognition and individual development planning along with reward packages we advance our talent pool and create a sustainable and longterm enterprise for additional discussion on the impact of covid19 on our employees see the summary of 2020 section in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 

the following table summarizes our total number of employees at december 31 2020

 



 



 

we allocate the personnel costs related to providing property management and leasing functions to our real estate operations and strategic capital segments based on the square footage of the respective portfolios the personnel costs to perform only strategic capital functions are allocated directly to that segment

 

we believe we have good relationships with our employees prologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements other than in brazil although some employees in europe are represented by statutory works councils and as such benefit from applicable labor agreements

environmental matters

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired including land while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we think would have a material adverse effect beyond amounts recorded as of december 31 2020 see further discussion in item 1a risk factors and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

 

governmental matters

 

we are exposed to various regulatory requirements taxes tariffs trade wars and laws within the countries in which we operate and unexpected changes in these items may result in unanticipated losses adverse tax consequences and affect our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be impacted by the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations and transfer pricing regulations the impact of regional or countryspecific economic instability including government shutdowns or other internal trade alliances or agreements could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see further discussion in item 1a risk factors

 

insurance coverage

 

we carry insurance coverage on our properties we determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance selfinsurance and a whollyowned captive insurance entity the costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through expense reimbursements from our customers we believe our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured see further discussion in item 1a risk factors

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition including but not limited to our financial position results of operations cash flow ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market value of our securities these risks relate to prologis as well as our investments in consolidated and unconsolidated entities and include among others i risks related to our global operations ii risks related to our business iii risks related to financing and capital iv risks related to income taxes and v general risks

 

risks related to our global operations

 

as a global company we are subject to social political and economic risks of doing business in many countries

 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the us during 2020 we generated approximately 484 million or 109 of our consolidated revenues from operations outside the us circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect us include but are not limited to the following factors

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

in addition we may be impacted by the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other factors

 

compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs

 

we are required to comply with many regulations in different countries including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar laws and regulations our properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as the americans with disabilities act and state and local fire and lifesafety requirements noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants while we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us

 

disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition

 

to the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect i the value of our properties ii the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing iii our ability to make principal and interest payments on or refinance any outstanding debt when due and iv the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect the market price of our securities and our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders

 

the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position

 

we hold significant real estate investments in international markets where the us dollar is not the functional currency at december 31 2020 approximately 86 billion or 153 of our total consolidated assets were invested in a currency other than the us dollar principally the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen for the year ended december 31 2020 289 million or 89 of our total consolidated segment noi as disclosed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data was denominated in a currency other than the us dollar as a result we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our business and specifically our us dollar reported financial position and results of operations

 

our hedging of foreign currency and interest rate risk may not effectively limit our exposure to other risks

 

we attempt to mitigate our risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we have significant investments thereby providing a natural hedge we may also enter into derivative financial instruments that we designate as net investment hedges as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments we enter into other foreign currency contracts such as forwards to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flow associated with the translation of future earnings of our international subsidiaries although we attempt to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in foreign currency rates there can be no assurance that those attempts will be successful hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency or interest rates and the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements the funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of the hedged foreign currency or the size of the underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of the breakage the failure to hedge effectively against foreign exchange changes or interest rate changes may adversely affect our business

 

risks related to our business

 

general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results

 

we are exposed to the economic conditions and other events and occurrences in the local regional national and international geographies in which we own properties our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties

 

at december 31 2020 309 of our consolidated operating properties or 136 billion based on consolidated gross book value or investment before depreciation were located in california central valley san francisco bay area and southern california markets 

which represented 262  of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 271  of our noi our revenues from and the value of our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for logistics properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california’s economic climate because of the investment we have located in california a downturn in california’s economy or real estate conditions  including state income tax and property tax laws could adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to california we also have significant holdings defined as more than 3 of total consolidated investment before depreciation in operating properties in certain markets located in atlanta chicago dallasfort worth houston lehigh valley new jerseynew york city seattle and south florida of these markets no single market contributed more than 10 of our total consolidated investment before depreciation our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties conditions such as an oversupply of logistics space or a reduction in demand for logistics space among other factors may impact operating conditions any material oversupply of logistics space or material reduction in demand for logistics space could adversely affect our overall business 

 

our om portfolio which includes our whollyowned properties and properties included in our coinvestment ventures has concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above as well as in markets in france japan mexico and the uk and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets which may reduce economic returns to investors

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as secured mortgage debt payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments as a reit under the irc we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable reit subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment to generate liquidity if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale we may not pursue such sales

 

we may decide to sell or contribute properties to certain of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures or sell properties to third parties to generate proceeds to fund our capital deployment activities our ability to sell or contribute properties on advantageous terms is affected by i competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties ii economic and market conditions including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties and iii other factors beyond our control if our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or at all the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital in the private and public markets in order to acquire properties from us should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then dispositions and contributions could be delayed 

 

if we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations sales or contributions of properties or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation divesting properties at less than optimal terms incurring debt entering into leases with new customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates there can be no assurance however that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us additionally taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our business and in particular our distributable cash flow and debt covenants

 

our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector

 

our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the logistics sector this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified

 

investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business

 

investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio market research and our asset management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated factors that may affect real estate values and cash flows include

 



 



 



 



 

 



 



 



 

these factors may affect our ability to recover our investment in the properties and result in impairment charges 

 

our customers may be unable to meet their lease obligations or we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or release space on favorable terms as leases expire

 

our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations at december 31 2020 our top 10 customers accounted for 163 of our consolidated ner in the event of default by a significant number of customers we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord and we may be unable to release spaces a customer may experience a downturn in its business which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease in addition a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow 

 

we are also subject to the risk that upon the expiration of leases they may not be renewed by existing customers the space may not be released to new customers or the terms of renewal or releasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire or we may lose potential customers

 

we may acquire properties and companies that involves risks which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

 

we have acquired properties and will continue to acquire properties through the direct acquisition of real estate the acquisition of entities that own real estate or through additional investments in coinvestment ventures that acquire properties the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates when we acquire properties we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures additionally there is and it is expected there will continue to be significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities the acquired properties or entities may be subject to liabilities including tax liabilities which may be without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based on our new ownership of any of these entities or properties then we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it 

 

we may be unable to integrate the operations of newly acquired companies and realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits or do so within the anticipated timeframe potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include i the inability to dispose of nonindustrial assets or operations that are outside of our area of expertise ii potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses delays or regulatory conditions associated with these transactions and iii performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing these transactions and integrating the companies’ operations 

 

our real estate development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful

 

our real estate development and redevelopment strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through development of logistics facilities to hold for longterm investment contribution or sale to a coinvestment venture or third party depending on market conditions our liquidity needs and other factors we may increase our investment in the development renovation and redevelopment business and we expect to complete the buildout and leasing of our current development portfolio we may also develop renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed coinvestment ventures the real estate development renovation and redevelopment business includes the following significant risks

 



 



 



 



 



 

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming coinvestment ventures investing in new or existing coinvestment ventures attracting thirdparty investment and managing properties through coinvestment ventures

 

at december 31 2020 we had investments in coinvestment ventures both public and private that owned operating properties with a gross book value of approximately 49 billion our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in these ventures and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through coinvestment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances however there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new coinvestment ventures or attract thirdparty investment or that additional investments in new or existing ventures to develop or acquire properties will be successful further there can be no assurance that we are able to realize value from our existing or future investments the same factors that impact the valuation of our consolidated portfolio as discussed above also impact the portfolios held by the coinvestment ventures and could result in other than temporary impairment of our investment and a reduction in fee revenues 

 

our coinvestment ventures involve certain additional risks that we do not otherwise face including

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our coinvestment ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives however we may not be able to continue to do so indefinitely we have formed publicly traded investment vehicles such as npr and fibra prologis for which we serve as sponsor or manager these entities bear their own risks related to trading markets foreign currency exchange rates and market demand we have contributed and may continue to contribute assets into such vehicles there is a risk that our managerial relationship may be terminated 

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition

 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination

 

 

environmental laws in some countries including the us also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of our properties are known to contain asbestoscontaining building materials

 

in addition some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances furthermore certain of our properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in connection with certain divested properties we have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties

 

our insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses 

 

we and our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy namely windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets we believe our properties and the properties of our coinvestment ventures are adequately insured certain losses however including losses from floods earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots and pandemics generally are not insured against or not fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property

 

furthermore we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties and if there is recourse debt then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our business 

 

a number of our investments both whollyowned and owned through coinvestment ventures are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity us properties located in active seismic areas include properties in our markets in california and seattle international properties located in active seismic areas include japan and mexico we generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to selfinsure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis we have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for our assets in japan based on this analysis

 

furthermore a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane or flood risk we carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants

 

risks related to financing and capital

 

we may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments

 

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and if the maturing debt is secured the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness our credit facilities and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates increases in market interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements

 

covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition

 

the terms of our various credit agreements including our credit facilities the indentures under which our senior notes and term loans are issued and other note agreements require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage ratios leverage ratios fixed charge coverage ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance 

coverage these covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness if we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations our business and financial condition generally and in particular the amount of our distributable cash flow could be adversely affected 

 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity

 

at december 31 2020 our credit ratings from moody’s and sp were a3 and a respectively both with stable outlook a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization

 

the credit ratings of our senior notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing also a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our credit facilities and other debt instruments adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and in particular our refinancing and other capital market activities our ability to manage debt maturities our future growth and our development and acquisition activity

 

in order to meet reit distribution requirements we may need access to external sources of capital

 

to qualify as a reit we are required each year to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders and we may be subject to tax to the extent our taxable income is not fully distributed historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders however we may elect to pay a portion of the distribution in shares of our stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital furthermore to maintain our reit status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all depends on a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities

 

the financial conduct authority “fca” the authority that regulates the london interbank offered rate “libor” announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 which will require transition to an alternative reference rate that could have a negative impact on our required debt payments and the value of our related debt and derivative financial instruments

 

in july 2017 the fca announced it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 as a result in the us the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as its preferred alternative rate for usd libor for debt and derivative financial instruments in november 2020 the federal reserve board along with various independent groups announced the potential for certain usd libor tenors to continue to be published until june 2023 this change would allow most legacy usd libor contracts to mature before disruptions occur in the usd libor market without the need to transition those contracts to sofr the expected transition of gbp libor and yen libor at the end of 2021 was not impacted by this announcement additionally other global regulators have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify a preferred alternative rate for other interbank offered rates “ibors” we refer to these rates collectively as “iborindexed” at december 31 2020 we had variable rate debt of 20 billion excluding borrowings that are hedged through interest rate swap agreements see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional discussion regarding our variable rate debt

 

our loan documents contain provisions that contemplate alternative methods to determine the base rate applicable to our iborindexed debt to the extent iborindexed rates are not available additionally no mandatory prepayment or redemption provisions would be triggered under our loan documents in the event that the iborindexed rates are not available if a contract is not transitioned to a preferred alternative rate and iborindexed rates are discontinued the impact on our debt and derivative financial instruments is likely to vary by contract if iborindexed rates are discontinued or if the methods of calculating the rates change interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected while we currently expect iborindexed rates to be available until the end of 2021 it is possible that they will become unavailable prior to that time

 

we anticipate managing the transition to a preferred alternative rate using the language set out in our agreements and through potentially modifying our debt and derivative instruments however future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications and we may incur significant associated costs in doing so we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact on our debt payments and value of our related debt and derivative financial instruments however we are not able to predict when iborindexed rates will cease to be available

 

our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock or units in the op

 

any additional future issuance of common stock or op units will reduce the percentage of our common stock and units owned by investors in most circumstances stockholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock or units in addition depending on the terms and pricing of any additional offering of our common stock or op units and the utilization of the proceeds our stockholders and unitholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock or units

 

risks related to income tax

 

the failure of prologis inc to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences

 

prologis inc elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the irc commencing with the taxable year ended december 31 1997 we believe prologis inc has been organized and operated to qualify as a reit under the irc and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the irc to enable prologis inc to continue to qualify as a reit however it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow prologis inc to qualify as a reit or that our future operations could cause prologis inc to fail to qualify qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some annually and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex sections of the irc for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control for example to qualify as a reit prologis inc must derive at least 95 of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition prologis inc must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders but we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances our own stock the provisions of the irc and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a reit are more complicated for prologis inc because we hold substantially all of our assets through the op

 

if prologis inc fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be required to pay federal income tax including for taxable years prior to 2018 any applicable alternative minimum tax on taxable income at regular corporate rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions prologis inc would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it lost the qualification and would be subject to corporate tax on builtin gains that exist at the time of reit reelection if recognized within the fiveyear period after reelection and potentially 10 years for certain states if prologis inc lost its reit status our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved in addition we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment operations and distributions would be reduced

 

furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits that elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the irc provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit 95 and 75 gross income tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to us federal income tax in addition a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect on the ability of prologis inc to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus its ability to qualify as a reit

 

in addition we may acquire properties through the acquisition of reit entities that own the real estate if a gain in such assets is not otherwise recognized by the seller or target in such acquisitions and such entities were to fail to satisfy the reit requirements for any year they would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the reit qualification was lost and the acquired assets would be subject to corporate tax on builtin gains that exist at the time of reit reelection or if earlier at the time of prologis’ acquisition of the assets a sale of such assets within the 5year recognition period and potentially 10 years for certain states could result in corporate tax liabilities that could be significant 

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction

 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties including by contributing properties to our coinvestment ventures under the irc any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service “irs” may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions while we believe that the irs would not prevail in any such dispute if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

 

legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us

 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the us state local and foreign income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate reits similar entities and investments additional changes are likely to continue to occur in the future both in and outside of the us and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders any increases in tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes

 

complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities

 

our use of taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the irc no more than 20 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities

 

general risks

 

our business may be materially and adversely affected by the impact of the global pandemic of covid19 

the world health organization and certain national and local governments characterized covid19 as a pandemic in march 2020 the covid19 outbreak has disrupted financial markets and global national and local economies there are government restrictions on activities across the globe the impact of the covid19 outbreak on our business that of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures and our customers for the longterm continues to be uncertain

 

given the ongoing and dynamic nature of these circumstances we cannot predict the extent to which the continuation of the covid19 pandemic may impact our business but its impact may include the following

 



 



 



 



 

any prolonged economic downturn escalation of the outbreak or disruption in the financial markets may also impact our ability to access capital markets to issue debt or equity securities and to complete real estate transactions at attractive pricing or at all

 

these items may materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and real estate values

 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks

 

despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks such as computer viruses or unauthorized access any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business we may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws unauthorized access to information of ours and others significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business 

 

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel

 

we depend on the deep industry knowledge and the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees from time to time our personnel and their roles may change while we believe that we are able to retain our key talent and find suitable employees to meet our needs the loss of key personnel any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our business if we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected

 

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting

 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and 

procedures and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements or a decline in the price of our securities 

 

we are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition

 

we are also exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate our logistics facilities may be exposed to catastrophic weather events such as severe storms fires or floods if the frequency of extreme weather events increases our exposure to these events could increase we do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change as the operation of our buildings typically does not generate a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions however we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain or stricter energy efficiency standards or greenhouse gas regulations for the commercial building sectors we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the potential impacts of future climate change on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral

management’s overview

 

summary of 2020

 

our financial condition and operating results remain strong in the covid19 environment and in combination with the demand we see in our proprietary data the pace of rent collections and dialogue with our customers our outlook continues to improve in the first quarter of 2021 however with the continued uncertainty across the globe until we put covid19 behind us we cannot predict the impact on our business future financial condition and operating results 

 

we experienced minimal impacts from the current environment on our om portfolio operating fundamentals in 2020 this is the result of the high quality and location of our real estate portfolio our customer base favorable market fundamentals in the logistics real estate sector and significant inplacetomarket rent spreads ecommerce continues to grow well above its historical average and customers that serve essential daily needs are thriving customers that have been negatively impacted by the current economy represent a minimal percentage of our annual rent leasing activity remained strong for the om portfolio throughout 2020 with the commencement of 150 million square feet of leases with an average term of 66 months including 37 million square feet in the fourth quarter rent change in our om portfolio was 213 during 2020 and 238 in the fourth quarter we expect market rents to continue to increase in 2021 the average number of days from lease proposal to commencement decreased since 2019 as some customers have increased the pace of activity

 

we received requests from certain customers for rent concessions during 2020 and for those granted we deferred the rental payments to a later period in 2020 or 2021 the deferral of rental payments did not impact revenue recognized from those leases during 2020 on an om basis we deferred 45 million of rental payments which represented less than 1 of our total om annualized rental revenue at january 25 2021 we had collected 33 million or 98 of the deferred payments due at december 31 st  with the remainder due in 2021 although covid19 continues to have a minimal impact on our rent collections and bad debt is trending lower than we initially anticipated we may experience an increase in bad debt

 

our capital deployment and disposition activities have continued throughout this time and we expect the volume of these activities to accelerate in 2021 by the fourth quarter of 2020 we restarted the majority of the speculative development projects that we suspended in the first quarter

 

our business continuity communication plans and technology are allowing all functions of our business to work smoothly during this time generally our employees have continued working remotely or in certain locations in our offices under protocols to keep a safe working environment we have not had any layoffs and we have extended financial assistance to employees in need our local property and leasing teams have continued to maintain our properties and work with our customers to help them navigate the new environment while following established measures to help keep them and our customers safe in addition we are providing assistance across the globe in the form of direct cash grants supplies and donation of over one million square feet through our space for good program in 2020 through the prologis foundation we pledged 5 million to covid19 relief organizations and 1 million in support of racial equality causes

 

we completed the following significant activities in 2020 as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 



 



 



 



 

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

in february 2020 we completed an exchange offer for two series of liberty’s senior notes for an aggregate amount of 750 million with 690 million or 920 of the aggregate principal amount being validly tendered for exchange these senior notes are included in the aggregate principal amounts of 400 million due in october 2026 with an interest rate of 33 and 350 million due in february 2029 with an interest rate of 44 the senior notes were exchanged for notes issued by a wholly owned subsidiary and guaranteed by the op all other terms of the exchanged liberty senior notes remained substantially the same

 

at december 31 2020 we had total available liquidity of 48 billion principally due to current aggregate availability under our credit facilities of 39 billion and unrestricted cash balances of 598 million 

 

results of operations 

 

we evaluate our business operations based on the noi of our two operating segments real estate operations and strategic capital noi by segment is a nongaap performance measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements we consider noi by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps management and investors understand our operating results 

 

 

below is a reconciliation of our noi by segment to operating income per the consolidated financial statements in millions each segment’s noi is reconciled to a line item in the consolidated financial statements in their respective segment discussions below

 



see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our segments and a reconciliation of each business segment’s noi to operating income and earnings before income taxes 

 

real estate operations

 

this operating segment principally includes rental revenue and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties we allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses and the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios in addition this segment is impacted by our development acquisition and disposition activities

 

below are the components of real estate operations revenues expenses and noi in millions derived directly from the consolidated financial statements 

 



 

the change in real estate operations noi in 2020 compared to 2019 was impacted by the following items dollars in millions

strategic capital

 

this operating segment includes revenues from asset and property management other fees for services performed and promote revenue earned from the unconsolidated entities revenues associated with the strategic capital segment fluctuate because of changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions the fair value of the properties and other transactional activity including foreign currency exchange rates and timing of promotes these revenues are reduced by the direct costs associated with the asset and propertylevel management expenses for the properties owned by these ventures we allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses and to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios

 

below are the components of strategic capital revenues expenses and noi derived directly from the consolidated financial statements in millions

we manage our business and review our operating fundamentals on an om basis which includes properties wholly owned by us or owned by one of our coinvestment ventures we believe reviewing the fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact to the financial statements as it will affect both the real estate operations and strategic capital segments as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures based on our ownership we do not control the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures for purposes of gaap and the presentation of the ventures’ operating information does not represent a legal claim 

 

our om operating portfolio does not include our development portfolio valueadded properties nonindustrial properties or properties we do not have the intent to hold longterm that are classified as either held for sale or within other real estate investments valueadded properties are properties that are expected to be repurposed or redeveloped to a higher and better use and recently acquired properties that present opportunities to create greater value see below for information on our om operating portfolio at december 31 square feet in millions

 



 

 

below are the key operating metrics summarizing the leasing activity of our om operating portfolio

 

 



 



 

same store analysis

 

our same store metrics are nongaap financial measures which are commonly used in the real estate industry and expected from the financial community on both a net effective and cash basis we evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period which allows us and investors to analyze our ongoing business operations we determine our same store metrics on property noi which is calculated as rental revenue less rental expense for the applicable properties in the same store population for both consolidated and unconsolidated properties based on our ownership interest as further defined below

 

we define our same store population for the three months ended december 31 2020 as the properties in our om operating portfolio including the property noi for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures at january 1 2019 and owned throughout the same threemonth period in both 2019 and 2020 we believe the drivers of property noi for the consolidated portfolio are generally the same for the properties owned by the ventures in which we invest and therefore we evaluate the same store metrics of the om portfolio based on prologis’ ownership in the properties “prologis share” the same store population excludes properties held for sale to third parties along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period january 1 2019 and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period to derive an appropriate measure of periodtoperiod operating performance we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the reported periodend exchange rate to translate from local currency into the us dollar for both periods

 

as nongaap financial measures the same store metrics have certain limitations as an analytical tool and may vary among real estate companies as a result we provide a reconciliation of rental revenues less rental expenses “property noi” from our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap to our same store property noi measures

 

we evaluate the results of our same store portfolio on a quarterly basis the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues rental expenses and property noi for each quarter in 2020 and 2019 to the full year as included in the consolidated statements of income and within note 19 to the consolidated financial statements and to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended december 31 dollars in millions

 



 

 



 



 



 

during the periods presented certain wholly owned properties were contributed to a coinvestment venture and are included in the same store portfolio neither our consolidated results nor those of the coinvestment ventures when viewed individually would be comparable on a same store basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period eg the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the venture subsequent to the contribution date based on our ownership interest at the end of the period as a result only line items labeled “prologis share of same store property noi” are comparable period over period

 



 

we manage our business and compensate our executives based on the same store results of our om portfolio at 100 as we manage our portfolio on an ownership blind basis we calculate those results by including 100 of the properties included in our same store portfolio

 

other components of income expense

 

earnings from unconsolidated entities net

 

we recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities which are accounted for using the equity method of 297 million and 200 million during 2020 and 2019 respectively the earnings we recognize can be impacted by i variances in revenues and expenses of each venture ii the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture iii gains or losses from the dispositions of properties and extinguishment of debt iv our ownership interest in each venture and v fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to us dollars

 

 

see the discussion of our unconsolidated entities above in the strategic capital segment discussion and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized

 

interest expense

 

the following table details our net interest expense dollars in millions

 



 

interest expense increased due to higher debt balances in 2020 as compared to 2019 driven primarily by the issuance of senior notes and debt assumed in the liberty transaction reduced partially by lower interest rates as a result of our refinancing activities as discussed under the summary of 2020 section

 

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs   

 

foreign currency and derivative gains losses net

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk we recognize the change in fair value of the undesignated derivative contracts in unrealized gains and losses upon settlement of these transactions we recognize realized gains or losses 

 

we primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge we have issued debt in a currency that is not the same functional currency of the borrowing entity and have designated a portion of the debt as a nonderivative net investment hedge we recognize the remeasurement and settlement of the unhedged portion of the debt and accrued interest in unrealized gains or losses

 

the following table details our foreign currency and derivative gains losses net included in earnings in millions

 



 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative financial instrument policies and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our derivative and nonderivative transactions

 

losses on early extinguishment of debt net

 

as discussed above during 2020 we issued 62 billion of senior notes aggregate principal in us dollars and used the proceeds to redeem certain higher interest rate debt before maturity this resulted in extending our weighted average remaining maturity to 10 years and lowering our weighted average effective interest rate to approximately 19 at december 31 2020 and the recognition of losses on early extinguishment of debt of 188 million during 2020 the losses included the extinguishment of debt assumed in the liberty transaction and the ipt transaction which represented the excess of the prepayment penalties over the premium recorded upon assumption of the debt during 2019 we recognized 16 million of losses on early extinguishment of debt see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section for more information regarding our debt repurchases 

 

income tax expense

 

we recognize income tax expense related to our taxable reit subsidiaries and in the local state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income including 

gains on the disposition and contribution of properties and fees earned from the coinvestment ventures  deferred income tax expense benefit is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries 

 

the following table summarizes our income tax expense benefit in millions

 



 

our income taxes are discussed in more detail in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests

 

this amount represents the thirdparty investors’ share of the earnings generated in consolidated entities in which we do not own 100 of the equity reduced by the thirdparty share of fees or promotes payable to us and earned during the period we had net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of 135 million and 129 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively included in these amounts were 42 million and 47 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively of net earnings attributable to the common limited partnership unitholders of prologis lp

liquidity and capital resources

 

overview

 

we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities distributions from our coinvestment ventures contributions and dispositions of properties and available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development acquisition operating debt service dividend and distribution requirements

 

nearterm principal cash sources and uses

 

in addition to dividends and distributions we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following

 



 



 



 



 



 

 



 



 

we expect to fund our cash needs principally from the following sources subject to market conditions

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we may also generate proceeds from the issuance of equity securities subject to market conditions

 

debt

 

the following table summarizes information about our consolidated debt by currency at december 31 dollars in millions 

 



 



 

our credit ratings at december 31 2020 were a3 from moody’s and a from standard  poor’s both with stable outlook these ratings allow us to borrow at an advantageous interest rate adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and in particular our refinancing and other capital market activities our ability to manage debt maturities our future growth and our development and acquisition activity a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization

 

at december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants these covenants include customary financial covenants for total debt encumbered debt and fixed charge coverage ratios 

 

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our debt

 

equity commitments related to certain coinvestment ventures

 

certain coinvestment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash we may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash 

 

 

the following table summarizes the remaining equity commitments at december 31 2020 in millions

 



 



 



 

see the cash flow summary below for more information about our investment activity in the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures 

 

unconsolidated coinvestment venture debt

 

we had investments in and advances to our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures at december 31 2020 of 67 billion the ventures listed below had total thirdparty debt of 118 billion at december 31 2020 certain of our ventures do not have thirdparty debt and are therefore excluded this debt is nonrecourse to prologis and other investors in the coinvestment ventures and matures and bears interest as follows at december 31 2020 dollars in millions 

 



 



 

at december 31 2020 we did not guarantee any thirdparty debt of the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures in our role as the manager or sponsor we work with the coinvestment ventures to maintain sufficient liquidity and refinance their maturing debt there can be no assurance that the coinvestment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt or at all if the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets certain of our ventures also have credit facilities or unencumbered properties both of which may be used to obtain funds

 

cash flow summary 

 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity in millions

 



 

 

operating activities

 

cash provided by operating activities exclusive of changes in receivables and payables was impacted by the following significant activities

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

investing activities

 

cash provided by investing activities is driven by proceeds from contributions and dispositions of real estate properties cash used in investing activities is primarily driven by our capital deployment activities of investing in real estate development acquisitions and capital expenditures see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these activities in addition the following significant transactions also impacted our cash provided by or used in investing activities 





 



 



 



 



 

 

financing activities

 

cash provided by and used in financing activities is principally driven by proceeds from and payments on credit facilities and other debt along with dividends paid on common and preferred stock and noncontrolling interest contributions and distributions in addition the following significant transactions also impacted our cash provided by or used in financing activities

 



 

our repurchase of and payments on debt and proceeds from the issuance of debt consisted of the following activity in millions

 



 



 

distribution and dividend requirements

 

our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the irc relative to maintaining our reit status while still allowing us to retain cash to fund capital improvements and other investment activities 

 

under the irc reits may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income

 

we paid quarterly cash dividends of 058 and 053 per common share in 2020 and 2019 respectively our future common stock dividends if and as declared may vary and will be determined by the board based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time including our financial condition operating results and reit distribution requirements and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year

 

we make distributions on the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend the class a units in the op are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to 064665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least 040 per unit we paid a quarterly cash distribution of 064665 per class a unit in 2020 and 2019 

 

at december 31 2020 we had 13 million shares of series q preferred stock outstanding with a liquidation preference of 50 per share the annual dividend rate is 854 per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock

 

other commitments

 

on an ongoing basis we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties 

 

critical accounting policies

 

a critical accounting policy is one that involves an estimate or assumption that is subjective and requires management judgment about the effect of a matter that is inherently uncertain and material to an entity’s financial condition and results of operations management’s judgment considers historical and current economic conditions and expectations for the future changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance of the significant accounting policies discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial 

statements those presented below have been identified by us as meeting the criteria to be considered critical accounting policies refer to not e 2 for more information on these critical accounting policies 

 

asset acquisitions

 

we generally account for an acquisition of a single property or portfolio of properties as an asset acquisition we measure the real estate assets acquired through an asset acquisition based on their cost or total consideration exchanged and any excess consideration or bargain purchase amount is allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis assets we do not intend to hold longterm are recorded at fair value at a propertylevel we allocate the fair value to the components which include building land improvements and intangible assets or liabilities related to acquired leases the most significant portion of the allocation is to building and land and requires the use of market based estimates and assumptions 

 

the purchase price allocation is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located utilizing an income approach methodology which may be a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated noi of a property key assumptions include market rents growth rates and discount and capitalization rates estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results known trends and market and economic conditions we determine discount and capitalization rates by market based on recent transactions and other market data and adjust if necessary based on the property characteristics the fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale the use of different assumptions to value the acquired properties and allocate the most significant portion of the property value between the building and land could affect the expenses we recognize over the estimated remaining useful life

 

recoverability of real estate assets

 

we assess the carrying values of our respective longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable this assessment is primarily triggered based on the shortening of the expected hold period due to our change in intent to sell a property in the near term we have processes to monitor our intent with regard to our investments and the estimated disposition value in comparison to the current carrying value if our assessment of potential triggering events indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to sell in the near term is not recoverable we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property we determine the fair value of the property based on the proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on quoted market values thirdparty appraisals or discounted cash flow models that utilize the future net rental income of the property and expected market capitalization rates the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business changes in economic and operating conditions could impact our intent and the assumptions used in determining the fair value that could result in future impairment

 

new accounting pronouncements

 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

 

funds from operations attributable to common stockholdersunitholders “ffo”

 

ffo is a nongaap financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings

 

the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales along with impairment charges of previously depreciated properties we also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties we exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties’ share of our consolidated coinvestment ventures

 

our ffo measures

 

our ffo measures begin with nareit’s definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy while not infrequent or unusual the additional items we adjust for in calculating ffo as modified by prologis and core ffo  both as defined below are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term these items have both positive and negative shortterm effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our longterm outlook

 

we calculate our ffo measures as defined below based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures we reflect our share of our ffo measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our ffo measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods

 

 

these ffo measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses we do not use our ffo measures as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap as indicators of our operating performance as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs

 

we analyze our operating performance principally by the rental revenue of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business net of operating administrative and financing expenses this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities

 

ffo as modified by prologis attributable to common stockholdersunitholders “ffo as modified by prologis”

 

to arrive at ffo as modified by prologis  we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax specifically

 



 



 



 

we use ffo as modified by prologis  so that management analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other reits that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the us

 

core ffo attributable to common stockholdersunitholders “core ffo”

 

in addition to ffo as modified by prologis  we also use core ffo to arrive at core ffo we adjust ffo as modified by prologis  to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly in ffo as modified by prologis 

 



 



 



 



 



 

we use core ffo  including by segment and geographies to i assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies ii evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods iii evaluate the performance of our management iv budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources v provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance and vi evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results

 

limitations on the use of our ffo measures

 

while we believe our modified ffo measures are important supplemental measures neither nareit’s nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are therefore limited as an analytical tool accordingly these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business some of the limitations are

 



 



 



 

 



 



 



 



 

we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions this information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap to assist investors in compensating for these limitations we reconcile our modified ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap as follows in millions

 



 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to the impact of foreign exchangerelated variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments and interest rate changes see our risk factors in item 1a risk factors specifically risks related to our global operations and risks related to financing and capital see also notes 2 and 15 in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information about our foreign operations and derivative financial instruments

 

we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates at december 31 2020 the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following sections the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value as a result revenues and expenses as well as our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates

 

foreign currency risk

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange variability related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our results of operations or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge additionally we hedge our foreign currency risk by entering into derivative financial 

instruments that we designate as net investment hedges as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments at december 31 20 20  after consideration of our ability to borrow in the foreign currencies in which we invest and also derivative and nonderivative financial instruments as discussed in note 1 5 to the consolidated financial statements we had minimal net equity denominated in a currency other than the us dollar 

 

for the year ended december 31 2020 442 million or 100 of our total consolidated revenue was denominated in foreign currencies we enter into other foreign currency contracts such as forwards to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency associated with the translation of the future earnings of our international subsidiaries we have forward contracts that were not designated as hedges denominated principally in british pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen and have an aggregate notional amount of 12 billion to mitigate risk associated with the translation of the future earnings of our subsidiaries denominated in these currencies the gain or loss on settlement of these contracts is included in our earnings and offsets the lower or higher translation of earnings from our investments denominated in currencies other than the us dollar although the impact to net earnings is mitigated through higher translated us dollar earnings from these currencies a weakening of the us dollar against these currencies by 10 could result in a 116 million cash payment on settlement of these contracts

 

interest rate risk

 

we are also exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows to mitigate that risk we generally borrow with fixed rate debt and we may use derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on our variable rate debt at december 31 2020 149 billion of our debt bore interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments was affected by changes in market interest rates at december 31 2020 20 billion of our debt bore interest at variable rates the following table summarizes the future repayment of debt and scheduled principal payments at december 31 2020 dollars in millions

 



 



 



 

at december 31 2020 the weighted average effective interest rate on our variable rate debt was 05 changes in interest rates can cause interest expense to fluctuate on our variable rate debt on the basis of our sensitivity analysis a 10 increase in interest rates on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances would result in additional annual interest expense of 1 million for the year ended december 31 2020 which equates to a change in interest rates of 5 basis points on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances and 1 basis point on our average total debt portfolio balances

 item 1 business

 

prologis inc is a selfadministered and selfmanaged reit and is the sole general partner of prologis lp through which it holds substantially all of its assets we operate prologis inc and prologis lp as one enterprise and therefore our discussion and analysis refers to prologis inc and its consolidated subsidiaries including prologis lp we invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we coinvest with partners and investors we have a significant ownership in the coinvestment ventures which may be consolidated or unconsolidated based on our level of control of the entity

 

prologis inc began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended “internal revenue code” or “irc” we believe the current organization and method of operation will enable prologis inc to maintain its status as a reit prologis lp was also formed in 1997

 

we operate and manage our business on an owned and managed “om” basis and therefore evaluate the operating performance of the properties for our om portfolio which includes our consolidated properties and properties owned by our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures we make operating decisions based on our total om portfolio as we manage the properties regardless of ownership we also evaluate our results based on our proportionate economic ownership of each property included in the om portfolio “our share” as it represents the financial results of our share of the om portfolio

the company

 

as the global leader in logistics real estate prologis has a presence in 19 countries across four continents we own manage and develop welllocated highquality logistics facilities with a focus on the consumption side of the global supply chain our local teams actively manage our portfolio which encompasses leasing and property management capital deployment and opportunistic dispositions generally allowing us to recycle capital to selffund our development and acquisition activities the majority of our properties in the united states “us” are wholly owned while our properties outside the us are primarily held in coinvestment ventures which has the benefit of mitigating our exposure to foreign currency movements 

 

our portfolio is focused on the world’s most vibrant centers of commerce and our scale allows us to respond to our customers’ needs for the highestquality buildings across these locations as ecommerce increasingly moves to the forefront of the global supply chain it 

 

drives demand for logistics real estate close to the end consumer over time we have invested in properties located withi n infill and urban areas in our largest global markets with immediate access to the consumer population these are our last touch ® facilities this positioning gives us the unique ability to provide our customers with the right solutions in their supply chains that in turn  allows them to meet end consumer expectations as we look to the future of logistics real estate we strive to innovate through the development of multistory logistics facilities creating community workforce programs to develop skilled labor leveraging technology to invest in data driven operational efficiencies and negotiating better pricing on common products and services that our customers need our customers turn to us because they know that a strategic relationship with prologis is a competitive advantage 

 

at december 31 2019 we owned or had investments in properties on a whollyowned basis or through ventures in the following geographies dollars in billions based on gross book value and total expected investment as defined below and square feet in millions 

 

 

on january 8 2020 our two us coinvestment ventures acquired the whollyowned real estate assets of industrial property trust inc “ipt” for approximately 4 billion our investment was approximately 16 billion the portfolio included 236 properties aggregating 38 million square feet the portfolio was generally split evenly between the two coinvestment ventures

 

on february 4 2020 we acquired liberty property trust and liberty property limited partnership collectively “liberty” through a merger transaction which we refer to as the “liberty transaction” and is fully detailed in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements the liberty portfolio was primarily comprised of logistics real estate assets including 550 industrial operating properties aggregating 108 million square feet which were highly complementary to our us portfolio in terms of product quality location and growth potential the portfolio also included development in progress and land for future logistics facilities and office properties the acquisition expanded our presence in target markets such as lehigh valley chicago houston central pennsylvania new jersey and southern california the total acquisition price was approximately 13 billion through the issuance of equity based on the value of the prologis common stock issued using the closing price on february 3 2020 and the assumption of debt as a result of the closely aligned portfolios and similar business strategy we anticipate integrating the ipt and liberty properties while adding minimal property management expenses and further scaling our operations

 

throughout this discussion we reflect amounts in us dollars our reporting currency included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies principally the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated to us dollars we mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by investing outside the us through coinvestment ventures borrowing in the functional currency of our consolidated subsidiaries and utilizing derivative financial instruments

 

 

operating segments 

 

our business comprises two operating segments real estate operations and strategic capital 

 

below is information summarizing consolidated activity within our segments over the last three years in millions 

 

 



 



 

 

real estate operations

 

rental rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contribute 85 to 90 of our consolidated revenues earnings and funds from operations “ffo” we collect rent from our customers through longterm operating leases including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs we expect to generate longterm internal growth by increasing rents maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses the primary driver of our revenue growth will be rolling inplace leases to current market rents which are increasing in the majority of our markets we believe our active portfolio management combined with the skills of our property leasing maintenance capital energy sustainability and risk management teams allow us to maximize noi across our portfolio a significant amount of our rental revenue noi and cash flows are generated in the us 

 

development given the scarcity of modern logistics facilities in urban centers our development business allows us to build what our customers need we develop properties to meet these needs deepen our market presence and refresh our portfolio quality we believe we have a competitive advantage due to i the strategic locations of our land bank ii the development expertise of our local teams and iii the depth of our customer relationships successful development and redevelopment efforts provide significant earnings growth as projects lease up and generate income and increase the net asset value of our real estate operations segment based on our current estimates our consolidated land including options has the potential to support the development of 94 billion of tei of new logistics space generally we develop properties in the us for longterm hold and outside the us for contribution to our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures 

 

strategic capital

 

our strategic capital segment allows us to partner with some of the world’s largest institutional investors to grow our business through private capital we also access capital in this segment through two publicly traded vehicles nippon prologis reit inc in japan and fibra prologis in mexico we align our interests with those of our partners by holding significant ownership interests in all of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures ranging from 15 to 50 which generally allows us to reduce our exposure to foreign currency movements for investments outside the us

 

this segment produces stable longterm cash flows and generally contributes 10 to 15 of our consolidated revenues earnings and ffo we generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures principally through asset and property management services these revenues are principally earned from openended or longterm ventures we earn additional revenues by providing leasing acquisition construction development legal and disposition services in certain ventures we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees “promotes” or “promote revenues” periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation we plan to profitably grow this business by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures most of the strategic capital revenues are generated outside the us noi in this segment is calculated directly from our consolidated financial statements as strategic capital revenues less strategic capital expenses and excludes propertyrelated noi

 

 

future growth 

 

we believe the quality and scale of our global portfolio the expertise of our team the depth of our customer relationships and the strength of our balance sheet give us unique competitive advantages to grow revenues noi earnings ffo and cash flows

 

 



 



 



 



 



 

competition 

 

real estate ownership is highly fragmented and we therefore face competition from many owners and operators competitively priced logistics space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge which in turn could affect our operating results we may face competition regarding our capital deployment activities including local regional and national operators or developers we also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business

 

despite the competition we may face our strategic focus over the years has given us distinct competitive advantages including the following

 



 



 

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

customers

 

our broad customer base represents a spectrum of international national regional and local logistics users at december 31 2019 in our real estate operations segment representing our consolidated properties we had more than 2900 customers occupying 362 million square feet of logistics operating properties below are the primary types of goods in our buildings for our consolidated real estate properties at december 31 2019

 

 



 

 

the following table details our top 25 customers for our consolidated real estate properties at december 31 2019 square feet in millions 

 



 

in our strategic capital segment we view our partners and investors as our customers at december 31 2019 in our coinvestment ventures we partnered with approximately 132 investors several of which invest in multiple ventures

 

employees 

 

we believe our employees are the most important part of our business when attracting developing and retaining talent we seek individuals who hold varied experiences and viewpoints to create an inclusive and diverse culture and workplace that allows each employee to do their best work and drive our collective success we focus on leadership development at every level of the organization we align employees’ goals with our overall strategic direction to create a clear link between individual efforts and the longterm success of the organization and then provide effective feedback on their performance towards goals to ensure their growth we believe a commitment to our employees’ learning and development through training educational opportunities and mentorship is critical to our ability to continue to innovate through performance plans talent recognition and individual development planning along with reward packages we advance our talent pool and create a sustainable and longterm enterprise

 

the following table summarizes our total number of employees at december 31 2019

 



 



 

we allocate the employee costs to provide property management and leasing functions to our real estate operations and strategic capital segments based on the square footage of the respective portfolios the employee costs to perform only strategic capital functions are allocated directly to that segment

 

we believe we have good relationships with our employees prologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements other than in brazil although some employees in europe are represented by statutory works councils and as such benefit from applicable labor agreements

 

 

code of ethics and business conduct

 

we maintain a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to our board of directors the “board” and all of our officers and employees including the principal executive officer the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer and other people performing similar functions a copy of our code of ethics and business conduct is available on our website wwwprologiscom  in addition to being accessible through our website copies of our code of ethics and business conduct can be obtained free of charge upon written request to investor relations pier 1 bay 1 san francisco california 94111 any amendments to or waivers of our code of ethics and business conduct that apply to the principal executive officer the principal financial officer the principal accounting officer or other people performing similar functions and that relate to any matter enumerated in item 406b of regulation sk will be disclosed on our website 

 

environmental stewardship social responsibility and governance “esg”

 

the principles of esg are a natural fit in our business strategy esg creates value for our company by strengthening our relationships with our customers investors employees and the communities in which we do business — delivering a strategic business advantage while positively impacting the environment we develop modern and efficient building designs with stateoftheart technology to stay ahead of our customers’ needs while advancing structural transportation and energy requirements we invest in sustainable design features and practices such as the addition of solar panels cool roofs light emitting diode “led” lighting electric vehicle charging stations waste and diversion recycling and xeriscaping that result in costsavings and operational efficiency for our customers and reduce energy and water consumption as well as decrease greenhouse gas emissions across our portfolio and corporate operations 

 

we are committed to social responsibility and strengthening relationships important to our business through customer partnerships investor outreach community involvement labor solutions and inclusion and diversity initiatives as well as a focus on our employees and our customers’ employees through health and wellness programs and building design through our community workforce initiative for example we partner with local community organizations to provide logistics training and help our customers with their labor needs while benefitting local economies and providing new career opportunities our strong governance and oversight allows us to mitigate risk and preserve value creating a culture of uncompromising integrity through our board independence and diversity open communication with our stockholders and a risk management framework that supports our investment and process decisions the strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings ability to stay ahead of customer needs engagement with our employees through ethics and anticorruption training along with stockholder outreach ensures the financial operational and reputational resilience of our organization for the longterm our approach is reinforced by our code of ethics and business conduct as described above

 

environmental matters

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired including land while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability in excess of what was provided for in the underwriting of the acquisition that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see further discussion in item 1a risk factors and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

 

governmental matters

 

we are exposed to various regulatory requirements taxes tariffs trade wars and laws within the countries in which we operate and unexpected changes in these items may result in unanticipated losses adverse tax consequences and affect our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be impacted by the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations and transfer pricing regulations the impact of regional or countryspecific economic instability including government shutdowns or other internal trade alliances or agreements could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see further discussion in item 1a risk factors

 

insurance coverage

 

we carry insurance coverage on our properties we determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance selfinsurance and a whollyowned captive insurance entity the costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through reimbursements from our customers we believe our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured see further discussion in item 1a risk factors

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition including but not limited to our financial position results of operations cash flow ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market value of our securities these risks relate to prologis as well as our investments in consolidated and unconsolidated entities and 

 

include among others i general risks ii risks related to our business iii risks related to financing and capital and iv income tax risks 

 

general risks

 

as a global company we are subject to social political and economic risks of doing business in many countries

 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the us during 2019 we generated approximately 599 million or 180 of our revenues from operations outside the us circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect us include but are not limited to the following factors

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

in addition we may be impacted by the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other factors

 

disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition

 

to the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect i the value of our properties ii the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing iii our ability to make principal and interest payments on or refinance any outstanding debt when due and iv the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect the market price of our securities and our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders

 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks

 

despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks such as computer viruses or unauthorized access any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business we may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws unauthorized access to information of ours and others significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business 

 

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel

 

we depend on the deep industry knowledge and the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees from time to time our personnel and their roles may change while we believe that we are able to retain our key talent and find suitable employees to meet 

 

our needs the loss of key personnel any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our business if we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected 

 

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting

 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements or a decline in the price of our securities

 

the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position

 

we hold significant real estate investments in international markets where the us dollar is not the functional currency at december 31 2019 approximately 74 billion or 185 of our total consolidated assets were invested in a currency other than the us dollar principally the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen for the year ended december 31 2019 413 million or 172 of our total consolidated segment noi was denominated in a currency other than the us dollar as a result we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our business and specifically our us dollar reported financial position and results of operations

 

our hedging of foreign currency and interest rate risk may not effectively limit our exposure to other risks

 

we attempt to mitigate our risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we have significant investments thereby providing a natural hedge we may also enter into derivative financial instruments that we designate as net investment hedges as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments we enter into other foreign currency contracts such as forwards to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flow associated with the translation of future earnings of our international subsidiaries although we attempt to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in foreign currency rates there can be no assurance that those attempts will be successful hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency or interest rates and the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements the funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of the hedged foreign currency or the size of the underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of the breakage the failure to hedge effectively against foreign exchange changes or interest rate changes may adversely affect our business 

 

compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs

 

we are required to comply with many regulations in different countries including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar laws and regulations our properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as the americans with disabilities act and state and local fire and lifesafety requirements noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants while we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us

 

risks related to our business

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets which may reduce economic returns to investors

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as secured mortgage debt payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments as a reit under the irc we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable reit subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment to generate liquidity if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale we may not pursue such sales

 

we may decide to sell or contribute properties to certain of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures or sell properties to third parties to generate proceeds to fund our capital deployment activities our ability to sell or contribute properties on advantageous terms is affected by i competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties ii market conditions including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties and iii other factors beyond our control if our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or at all the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital in the private and public markets in order to acquire properties from us should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then dispositions and contributions could be delayed 

 

 

if we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations sales or contributions of properties or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation divesting properties whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term at less than optimal terms incurring debt entering into leases with new customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates there can be no assurance however that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us additionally taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our business and in particular our distributable cash flow and debt covenants

 

our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector

 

our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the logistics sector this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified

 

general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results

 

we are exposed to general economic conditions local regional national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties

 

at december 31 2019 350 of our consolidated operating properties or 112 billion based on consolidated gross book value or investment before depreciation were located in california central valley san francisco bay area and southern california markets which represented 286 of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 284 of our noi our revenues from and the value of our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for logistics properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california’s economic climate because of the investment we have located in california a downturn in california’s economy or real estate conditions including state income tax and property tax laws could adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to california we also have significant holdings defined as more than 3 of total consolidated investment before depreciation in operating properties in certain markets located in atlanta central and eastern pennsylvania chicago dallasfort worth houston new jerseynew york city seattle and south florida of these markets no single market contributed more than 10 of our total consolidated investment before depreciation our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties conditions such as an oversupply of logistics space or a reduction in demand for logistics space among other factors may impact operating conditions any material oversupply of logistics space or material reduction in demand for logistics space could adversely affect our overall business 

 

our om portfolio which includes our whollyowned properties and properties included in our coinvestment ventures has concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above as well as in markets in france germany japan mexico and the uk and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets

 

a number of our investments both whollyowned and owned through coinvestment ventures are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity us properties located in active seismic areas include properties in our markets in california and seattle international properties located in active seismic areas include japan and mexico we generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to selfinsure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis we have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for our assets in japan based on this analysis

 

furthermore a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane or flood risk we carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants 

 

investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business

 

investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio market research and our asset management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated factors that may affect real estate values and cash flows include

 



 



 

 



 



 



 



 



 

our customers may be unable to meet their lease obligations or we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or release space on favorable terms as leases expire

 

our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations at december 31 2019 our top 10 customers accounted for 152 of our ner in the event of default by a significant number of customers we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord and we may be unable to release spaces a customer may experience a downturn in its business which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease in addition a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow 

 

we are also subject to the risk that upon the expiration of leases they may not be renewed by existing customers the space may not be released to new customers or the terms of renewal or releasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers we may lose potential customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire 

 

we may acquire properties that involve risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

 

we have acquired properties and will continue to acquire properties through the direct acquisition of real estate and the acquisition of entities that own the real estate and through additional investments in coinvestment ventures that acquire properties the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates when we acquire properties we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures additionally there is and it is expected there will continue to be significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities the acquired properties or entities may be subject to liabilities including tax liabilities which may be without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based on ownership of any of these entities or properties then we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it 

 

we may be unable to integrate the liberty and ipt operations successfully and realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits or do so within the anticipated timeframe 

 

we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the operations of liberty and ipt potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following

 



 



 



 



 

for all these reasons it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of our management the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our operations services standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect the ability of prologis to maintain relationships with customers vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of these transactions or could otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results

 

 

our real estate development strategies may not be successful 

 

our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through development of logistics facilities to hold for longterm investment contribution or sale to a coinvestment venture or third party depending on market conditions our liquidity needs and other factors we may increase our investment in the development renovation and redevelopment business and we expect to complete the buildout and leasing of our current development portfolio we may also develop renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed coinvestment ventures the real estate development renovation and redevelopment business includes the following significant risks

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming coinvestment ventures investing in new or existing coinvestment ventures attracting thirdparty investment and managing properties through coinvestment ventures

 

at december 31 2019 we had investments in coinvestment ventures both public and private that owned operating properties with a gross book value of approximately 41 billion our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in these ventures and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through coinvestment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances however there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new coinvestment ventures or attract thirdparty investment or that additional investments in new or existing ventures to develop or acquire properties will be successful further there can be no assurance that we are able to realize value from such investments 

 

our coinvestment ventures involve certain additional risks that we do not otherwise face including

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

 

we generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our coinvestment ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives however we may not be able to continue to do so indefinitely we have formed publicly traded investment vehicles such as npr and fibra prologis for which we serve as sponsor or manager we have contributed and may continue to contribute assets into such vehicles there is a risk that our managerial relationship may be terminated 

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition

 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination

 

environmental laws in some countries including the us also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of our properties are known to contain asbestoscontaining building materials

 

in addition some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances furthermore certain of our properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in connection with certain divested properties we have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties

 

we are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition

 

we are also exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate our logistics facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events such as severe storms fires or floods if the frequency of extreme weather events increases our exposure to these events could increase we do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change as the operation of our buildings typically does not generate a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions however we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain or stricter energy efficiency standards or greenhouse gas regulations for the commercial building sectors we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the potential impacts of future climate change on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral

 

our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses 

 

we and our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy namely windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets we believe our properties and the properties of our coinvestment ventures are adequately insured certain losses however including losses from floods earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots generally are not insured against or not fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property

 

furthermore we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties and if there is recourse debt then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our business 

 

 

risks related to financing and capital 

 

we may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments

 

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and if the maturing debt is secured the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness our credit facilities and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements

 

covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition

 

the terms of our various credit agreements including our credit facilities the indentures under which our senior notes and term loans are issued and other note agreements require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage ratio leverage ratios fixed charge coverage ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness if we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations our business and financial condition generally and in particular the amount of our distributable cash flow could be adversely affected 

 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity

 

at december 31 2019 our credit ratings were a3 from moody’s and a from sp both with stable outlook a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization

 

the credit ratings of our senior notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing also a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our credit facilities and other debt instruments adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and in particular our refinancing and other capital market activities our ability to manage debt maturities our future growth and our development and acquisition activity

 

the financial conduct authority “fca” the authority that regulates the london interbank offered rate “libor” announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 which will require transition to an alternative reference rate that could have a negative impact on our required debt payments and the value of our related debt and derivative financial instruments

 

in july 2017 the fca announced it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 as a result in the us the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york identified the secured overnight financing rate as its preferred alternative rate for usd libor in debt and derivative financial instruments additionally other global regulators have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify a preferred alternative rate for other interbank offered rates “ibors” 

 

we have variablerate debt of 20 billion at december 31 2019 that are indexed to libor cdor and yen libor herein referred to as “iborindexed” our loan documents contain provisions that contemplate alternative methods to determine the base rate applicable to our iborindexed debt to the extent iborindexed rates are not available additionally no mandatory prepayment or redemption provisions would be triggered under our loan documents in the event that the iborindexed rates are not available if a contract is not transitioned to a preferred alternative rate and iborindexed rates are discontinued the impact on our debt and derivative financial instruments is likely to vary by contract if iborindexed rates are discontinued or if the methods of calculating the rates change interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected while we currently expect iborindexed rates to be available until the end of 2021 it is possible that they will become unavailable prior to that time

 

we anticipate managing the transition to a preferred alternative rate using the language set out in our agreements and through potentially modifying our debt and derivative instruments however future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications and we may incur significant associated costs in doing so we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact on our debt payments and value of our related debt and derivative financial instruments however we are not able to predict when iborindexed rates will cease to be available

 

in order to meet reit distribution requirements we may need access to external sources of capital

 

to qualify as a reit we are required each year to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders and we may be subject to tax to the extent our taxable income is not fully distributed historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our 

 

stockholders  however we may elect to pay a portion of the distribution in shares of our stock  assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital furthermore to maintain our reit status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all depends on a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities 

 

our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock or units in the op

 

any additional future issuance of common stock or op units will reduce the percentage of our common stock and units owned by investors in most circumstances stockholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock or units in addition depending on the terms and pricing of any additional offering of our common stock or units and the value of the properties our stockholders and unitholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock or units

 

income tax risks

 

the failure of prologis inc to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences

 

prologis inc elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the irc commencing with the taxable year ended december 31 1997 we believe prologis inc has been organized and operated to qualify as a reit under the irc and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the irc to enable prologis inc to continue to qualify as a reit however it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow prologis inc to qualify as a reit or that our future operations could cause prologis inc to fail to qualify qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some annually and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex sections of the irc for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control for example to qualify as a reit prologis inc must derive at least 95 of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition prologis inc must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders but we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances our own stock the provisions of the irc and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a reit are more complicated for prologis inc because we hold substantially all of our assets through the op

 

if prologis inc fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be required to pay federal income tax including for taxable years prior to 2018 any applicable alternative minimum tax on taxable income at regular corporate rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions prologis inc would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it lost the qualification and would be subject to corporate tax on builtin gains that exist at the time of reit reelection if recognized within the fiveyear period after reelection and potentially 10 years for certain states if prologis inc lost its reit status our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved in addition we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment operations and distributions would be reduced

 

furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits that elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the irc provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit 95 and 75 gross income tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to us federal income tax in addition a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect on the ability of prologis inc to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus its ability to qualify as a reit

 

in addition we may acquire properties through the acquisition of reit entities that own the real estate if a gain in such assets is not otherwise recognized by the seller or target in such acquisitions and such entities were to fail to satisfy the reit requirements for any year they would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the reit qualification was lost and the acquired assets would be subject to corporate tax on builtin gains that exist at the time of reit reelection or if earlier at the time of prologis’ acquisition of the assets a sale of such assets within the 5year recognition period and potentially 10 years for certain states could result in corporate tax liabilities that could be significant 

 

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction 

 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties including by contributing properties to our coinvestment ventures under the irc any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service “irs” may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions while we believe that the irs would not prevail in any such dispute if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

 

legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us

 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the us state local and foreign income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate reits similar entities and investments additional changes are likely to continue to occur in the future both in and outside of the us and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders any increases in tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes

 

complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities

 

our use of taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the irc no more than 20 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities

management’s overview 

 

summary of 2019

 

during the year ended december 31 2019 operating fundamentals remained strong for our om portfolio our occupancy decreased to 965 at december 31 2019 as compared to 975 at december 31 2018 due to our focus on rental rate growth as evidenced by our weighted average net effective rent change of 237 in our om portfolio during 2019

 

in 2019 we completed the following significant activities as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

subsequent to year end we closed the following transactions in 2020 

 



 



 



 

 

results of operations 

 

we evaluate our business operations based on the noi of our two operating segments real estate operations and strategic capital noi by segment is a nongaap performance measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements we consider noi by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps management and investors understand our operating results 

 

below is a reconciliation of our noi by segment to operating income per the consolidated financial statements in millions each segment’s noi is reconciled to a line item in the consolidated financial statements in their respective segment discussions below

 



see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our segments and a reconciliation of each business segment’s noi to operating income and earnings before income taxes 

 

real estate operations

 

this operating segment principally includes rental revenue and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties we allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses and the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios the operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to be strong which has increased rents and kept occupancies high in addition this segment is impacted by our development acquisition and disposition activities

 

below are the components of real estate operations revenues expenses and noi in millions derived directly from the consolidated financial statements 

 



 



 

the change in real estate operations noi in 2019 compared to 2018 was impacted by the following items dollars in millions

 

 



 

 



 



 



 

below are key operating metrics of our consolidated operating portfolio

 

 



 



 

development activity

 

the following table summarizes consolidated development activity dollars and square feet in millions

 



 



 

at december 31 2019 our consolidated development portfolio including properties under development and prestabilized properties with a tei of 40 billion was 500 leased and expected to be completed before december 2021 for additional information on our development portfolio at december 31 2019 see item 2 properties

 

 

capital expenditures 

 

we capitalize costs incurred in renovating and improving our operating properties as part of the investment basis or within other assets the following graph summarizes our total capital expenditures excluding development costs and property improvements per average square foot of our consolidated operating properties during each year

 

 



 

strategic capital

 

this operating segment includes revenues from asset and property management other fees for services performed and promote revenue earned from the unconsolidated entities revenues associated with the strategic capital segment fluctuate because of changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions the fair value of the properties and other transactional activity including foreign currency exchange rates and timing of promotes these revenues are reduced by the direct costs associated with the asset and propertylevel management expenses for the properties owned by these ventures we allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses and to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios

 

below are the components of strategic capital revenues expenses and noi derived directly from the consolidated financial statements in millions 

 



below is additional detail of our strategic capital revenues expenses and noi in millions

 





 



 



 



 

 

the following real estate investments were held through our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures based on historical cost at december 31 dollars and square feet in millions

 





 



 

see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures

 

ga expenses

 

ga expenses were 266 million and 239 million for 2019 and 2018 respectively ga expenses increased in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to higher compensation expenses based largely on the increase in our share price 

 

we capitalize certain internal costs including salaries and related expenses directly related to our development activities we previously capitalized ga related to our internal leasing activities however beginning january 1 2019 these costs were expensed and recorded to rental expenses in the consolidated statements of income 

 

the following table summarizes capitalized ga amounts in millions 

 



 

depreciation and amortization expenses

 

depreciation and amortization expenses were 11 billion and 947 million for 2019 and 2018 respectively

 

the following table highlights the key changes in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2019 as compared to 2018 dollars in millions

 



 

 

gains on real estate transactions net

 

the following table summarizes our gains on dispositions of development properties and land net and gains on other dispositions of investments in real estate net  which includes sales of nondeveloped properties primarily operating properties and other real estate transactions for the years ended december 31 in millions

 



 

we utilized the proceeds from these transactions primarily to fund our capital investments during both periods see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these transactions

 

our owned and managed “om” operating portfolio

 

we manage our business and review our operating fundamentals on an om basis which includes properties wholly owned by us or owned by one of our coinvestment ventures we believe reviewing the fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact to the financial statements as it will affect both the real estate operations and strategic capital segments as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures based on our ownership we do not control the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures for purposes of gaap and the presentation of the ventures’ operating information does not represent a legal claim 

 

our om operating portfolio does not include our development portfolio valueadded properties nonindustrial properties or properties held for sale to third parties and was as follows at december 31 square feet in millions

 



 

below are the key operating metrics summarizing the leasing activity of our om operating portfolio

 

 



 



 



 

same store analysis

 

our same store metrics are nongaap financial measures which are commonly used in the real estate industry and expected from the financial community on both a net effective and cash basis we evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period which allows us and investors to analyze our ongoing business operations we determine our same store metrics on property noi which is calculated as rental revenue less rental expense for the applicable properties in the same store population for both consolidated and unconsolidated properties based on our ownership interest as further defined below 

 

we define our same store population for the three months ended december 31 2019 as the properties in our om operating portfolio including the property noi for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures at january 1 2018 and owned throughout the same threemonth period in both 2018 and 2019 we believe the drivers of property noi for the consolidated portfolio are generally the same for the properties owned by the ventures in which we invest and therefore we evaluate the same store metrics of the om portfolio based on prologis’ ownership in the properties “prologis share” the same store population excludes properties held for sale to third parties along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period january 1 2018 and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period to derive an appropriate measure of periodtoperiod operating performance we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the reported periodend exchange rate to translate from local currency into the us dollar for both periods

 

as nongaap financial measures the same store metrics have certain limitations as an analytical tool and may vary among real estate companies as a result we provide a reconciliation of rental revenues less rental expenses “property noi” from our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap to our same store property noi measures

 

we evaluate the results of our same store portfolio on a quarterly basis the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues rental expenses and property noi for each quarter in 2019 and 2018 to the full year as included in the consolidated statements of income and within note 19 to the consolidated financial statements and to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended december 31 dollars in millions

 



 

 



 



 



 

during the periods presented certain wholly owned properties were contributed to a coinvestment venture and are included in the same store portfolio neither our consolidated results nor those of the coinvestment ventures when viewed individually would be comparable on a same store basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period eg the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the venture subsequent to the contribution date based on our ownership interest at the end of the period as a result only line items labeled “prologis share of same store property noi” are comparable period over period

 



 

we manage our business and compensate our executives based on the same store results of our om portfolio at 100 as we manage our portfolio on an ownership blind basis we calculate those results by including 100 of the properties included in our same store portfolio

 

other components of income expense

 

earnings from unconsolidated entities net

 

we recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities which are accounted for using the equity method of 200 million and 298 million during 2019 and 2018 respectively the decrease in earnings year over year was primarily due to significant gains recognized in 2018 on real estate dispositions in europe the earnings we recognize can be impacted by i variances in revenues and expenses of each venture ii the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture iii gains or losses from the dispositions of properties and extinguishment of debt iv our ownership interest in each venture and v fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to us dollars

 

 

see the discussion of our unconsolidated entities above in the strategic capital segment discussion and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized

 

interest expense

 

the following table details our net interest expense dollars in millions

 



 

net interest expense increased by 11 million primarily due to higher average debt balances in 2019 as compared to 2018 the increase in debt year over year was due to the assumption of debt in the dct transaction in august 2018 that was mostly refinanced with debt at lower interest rates additionally we recognized a gain upon settlement of the interest rate swaps on the canadian term loan in 2018

 

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs   

 

foreign currency and derivative gains losses net

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk we recognize the change in fair value of the undesignated derivative contracts in unrealized gains and losses upon settlement of these transactions we recognize realized gains or losses 

 

we primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge we may also issue debt in a currency that is not the same functional currency of the borrowing entity and we generally designate the debt as a nonderivative net investment hedge we recognize the remeasurement and settlement of the unhedged portion of the debt and accrued interest in unrealized gains or losses we also recognize the change in fair value and settlement of any undesignated derivative contracts to hedge the eventual payment of these borrowings in a foreign currency in unrealized gains or losses

 

the following table details our foreign currency and derivative gains losses net included in earnings in millions

 



 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative financial instrument policies and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our derivative and nonderivative transactions

 

losses on early extinguishment of debt net

 

we recognized a loss of 16 million and 3 million upon extinguishment of debt in 2019 and 2018 respectively through our financing activities in both 2019 and 2018 we reduced our effective interest rate and lengthened the maturities of our debt see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section for more information regarding our debt repurchases

 

income tax expense

 

we recognize income tax expense related to our taxable reit subsidiaries and in certain local state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income 

 

deferred income tax expense benefit is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries 

 

the following table summarizes our income tax expense benefit in millions

 



 

our income taxes are discussed in more detail in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests

at december 31 2019 we did not guarantee any thirdparty debt of the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures in our role as the manager or sponsor we work with the coinvestment ventures to maintain sufficient liquidity and refinance their maturing debt there can be no assurance that the coinvestment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt or at all if the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets certain of our ventures also have credit facilities or unencumbered properties both of which may be used to obtain funds

 

contractual obligations

 

longterm contractual obligations

 

the following table summarizes our longterm contractual obligations at december 31 2019 in millions

 



 



 



 

distribution and dividend requirements

 

our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the irc relative to maintaining our reit status while still allowing us to retain cash to fund capital improvements and other investment activities 

 

under the irc reits may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income

 

we paid quarterly cash dividends of 053 and 048 per common share in 2019 and 2018 respectively our future common stock dividends if and as declared may vary and will be determined by the board based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time 

 

including our financial condition operating results and reit distribution requirements and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year 

 

we make distributions on the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend the class a units in the op are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to 064665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least 040 per unit we paid a quarterly distribution of 064665 per class a unit in 2019 and 2018 

 

at december 31 2019 we had 14 million shares of series q preferred stock outstanding with a liquidation preference of 50 per share the annual dividend rate is 854 per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock

 

other commitments

 

on a continuing basis we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties 

 

critical accounting policies

 

a critical accounting policy is one that involves an estimate or assumption that is subjective and requires management judgment about the effect of a matter that is inherently uncertain and material to an entity’s financial condition and results of operations management’s best judgment considers historical and current economic conditions and expectations for the future changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance of the significant accounting policies discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements those presented below have been identified by us as meeting the criteria to be considered critical accounting policies refer to note 2 for more information on these critical accounting policies

 

acquisitions

 

we generally account for an acquisition of a single property or portfolio of properties as an asset acquisition we measure the real estate assets acquired through an asset acquisition based on their cost or total consideration exchanged and any excess consideration or bargain purchase amount is allocated to the real estate properties excluding those identified as held for sale on a relative fair value basis

 

we make estimates as part of our valuation of the assumed assets and liabilities at the acquisition date the components of an acquisition typically include buildings land improvements intangible assets or liabilities related to the acquired leases debt deferred tax assets and liabilities and other assumed assets and liabilities the purchase price allocation is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located utilizing an income approach methodology which may be a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated noi of a property key assumptions include market rents growth rates and discount and capitalization rates estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results known trends and market and economic conditions we determine discount and capitalization rates by market based on recent transactions and other market data the fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale the use of different assumptions to value the acquired properties and intangible assets and assumed liabilities could affect the future revenues and expenses we recognize over the estimated remaining useful life or lease term

 

recoverability of real estate assets

 

we assess the carrying values of our respective longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable

 

recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider current market conditions and propertylevel operating results as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models applying a capitalization rate to the estimated noi of a property quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals where considered necessary the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to hold is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property assumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows including market rents discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment

 

 

new accoun ting pronouncements 

 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

 

funds from operations attributable to common stockholdersunitholders “ffo”

 

ffo is a nongaap financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings

 

the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales along with impairment charges of previously depreciated properties we also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties we exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties’ share of our consolidated coinvestment ventures

 

our ffo measures

 

our ffo measures begin with nareit’s definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy while not infrequent or unusual the additional items we adjust for in calculating ffo as modified by prologis and core ffo  both as defined below are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term these items have both positive and negative shortterm effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our longterm outlook

 

we calculate our ffo measures as defined below based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures we reflect our share of our ffo measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our ffo measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods

 

these ffo measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses we do not use our ffo measures as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap as indicators of our operating performance as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs

 

we analyze our operating performance principally by the rental revenue of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business net of operating administrative and financing expenses this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities

 

ffo as modified by prologis attributable to common stockholdersunitholders “ffo as modified by prologis”

 

to arrive at ffo as modified by prologis  we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax specifically

 



 



 



 

we use ffo as modified by prologis  so that management analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other reits that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the us

 

core ffo attributable to common stockholdersunitholders “core ffo”

 

in addition to ffo as modified by prologis  we also use core ffo to arrive at core ffo we adjust ffo as modified by prologis  to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly in ffo as modified by prologis 

 



 



 

 



 



 



 

we use core ffo  including by segment and geographies to i assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies ii evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods iii evaluate the performance of our management iv budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources v provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance and vi evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results

 

limitations on the use of our ffo measures

 

while we believe our modified ffo measures are important supplemental measures neither nareit’s nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are therefore limited as an analytical tool accordingly these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business some of the limitations are

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

 

we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions this information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap to assist investors in compensating for these limitations we reconcile our modified ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap as follows in millions  

 



 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to the impact of foreign exchangerelated variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments and interest rate changes see our risk factors in item 1a risk factors specifically the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and we may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments see also notes 2 and 15 in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information about our foreign operations and derivative financial instruments

 

we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates at december 31 2019 the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following sections the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value as a result revenues and expenses as well as our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates

 

foreign currency risk

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange variability related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our results of operations or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge we may also issue debt in a currency that is not the same functional currency of the borrowing entity and we generally designate the debt as a nonderivative net investment hedge additionally we hedge our foreign currency risk by entering into derivative financial instruments that we designate as net investment hedges as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments at december 31 2019 after consideration of our ability to borrow in the foreign currencies in which we invest and also derivative and nonderivative financial instruments as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we had minimal net equity denominated in a currency other than the us dollar

 

for the year ended december 31 2019 545 million or 164 of our total consolidated revenue was denominated in foreign currencies we enter into other foreign currency contracts such as forwards to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency associated with the translation of the future earnings of our international subsidiaries we have forward contracts that were not designated as hedges denominated principally in british pound sterling canadian dollar euro japanese yen and swedish krona and have an aggregate notional amount of 11 billion to mitigate risk associated with the translation of the future earnings of our subsidiaries denominated in these currencies although the impact to net earnings is mitigated through higher translated us dollar earnings from these currencies 

 

a weakening of the us dollar against these c urrencies by 10 c ould result in a  111 million cash payment on settlement of these contracts  

 

interest rate risk

 

we are also exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows to mitigate that risk we generally borrow with fixed rate debt and we may use derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on our variable rate debt at december 31 2019 100 billion of our debt bore interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments was affected by changes in market interest rates at december 31 2019 20 billion of our debt bore interest at variable rates the following table summarizes the future repayment of debt and scheduled principal payments at december 31 2019 dollars in millions

 



 



 

at december 31 2019 the weighted average effective interest rate on our variable rate debt was 06 changes in interest rates can cause interest expense to fluctuate on our variable rate debt on the basis of our sensitivity analysis a 10 increase in interest rates on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances would result in additional annual interest expense of 1 million for the year ended december 31 2019 which equates to a change in interest rates of 8 basis points on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances and 1 basis point on our average total debt portfolio balances

 item 1 business

 

prologis inc is a selfadministered and selfmanaged reit and is the sole general partner of prologis lp through which it holds substantially all of its assets we operate prologis inc and prologis lp as one enterprise and therefore our discuss ion and analysis refers to prologis inc and its consolidated subsidiaries including prologis lp collectively we invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we coinvest with partners and investors we have a significant ownership in the coinvestment ventures which may be consolidated or unconsolidated based on our level of control of the entity

 

prologis inc began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended “internal revenue code” we believe the current organization and method of operation will enable prologis inc to maintain its status as a reit prologis lp was also formed in 1997

 

we operate and evaluate our business on an owned and managed “om” basis including properties that we whollyown and properties that are owned by one of our coinvestment ventures we make decisions based on the property operations regardless of our ownership interest our investment consists of our whollyowned properties and our pro rata or ownership share of the properties owned in ventures 

 

our corporate headquarters is located at pier 1 bay 1 san francisco california 94111 and our other principal office locations are in amsterdam denver luxembourg mexico city shanghai singapore and tokyo

 

our internet address is wwwprologiscom  all reports required to be filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” are available and can be accessed free of charge through the investor relations section of our website the common stock of prologis inc is listed on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the ticker “pld” and is a component of the standard  poor’s “sp” 500

 

the company

 

prologis is the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on key markets in 19 countries on four continents we own manage and develop welllocated highquality logistics facilities our local teams actively manage our portfolio which encompasses leasing and property management capital deployment and opportunistic dispositions allowing us to recycle capital to selffund our development and acquisition activities the majority of our properties in the united states “us” are wholly owned while our properties outside the us are generally held in coinvestment ventures to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency movements 

 

our irreplaceable portfolio is focused on the world’s most vibrant markets where consumption and supply chain reconfiguration drive logistics demand in the developed markets of the us europe and japan key demand drivers include the reconfiguration of supply chains strongly influenced by ecommerce trends the demand for sustainable design features and the operational efficiencies that can be realized from highquality logistics facilities in emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico growing affluence and the rise of a new consumer class have increased the need for modern distribution networks our strategy is to own the highestquality logistics property portfolio in each of our target markets these markets are characterized by what is most important for the consumption side of a logistics supply chain — large population centers with proximity to labor pools surrounded by highways rail service or ports customers turn to us because they know an efficient supply chain will make their businesses succeed and that a strategic relationship with prologis will create a competitive advantage 

 

on august 22 2 018 we acquired dct industrial trust inc at acquisition dct industrial trust inc and dct industrial operating partnership lp “dct” collectively merged into prologis inc and prologis lp respectively which we refer to as the dct transaction the dct transaction was valued at 85 billion consisting of the issuance of 66 billion of equity and the assu mption of 19 billion of debt of which 18 billion was subsequently paid down the dct portfolio of logistics real es tate assets wa s highly complementary to our portfolio in terms of product quality location and growth potential the acquisition expanded our presence in the high growth us markets of san francisco bay area  seattle  southern ca lifornia and south florid a as a result of the closely aligned portfolios and similar business strategies we have integrated the properties while adding minimal property management expenses  our results for 2018 include the dct port folio from the date of acquisition  see note 3 t o the consolidate d financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information 

 

at december 31 2018 we owned or had investments in properties on a whollyowned basis or through ventures in the following regions dollars in billions based on gross book value and total expected investment as defined below and square feet in millions 

 

 

throughout this discussion we reflect amounts in us dollars our reporting currency included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies principally the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated to us dollars we mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by investing outside the us through coinvestment ventures borrowing in the functional currency of our consolidated subsidiaries and utilizing derivative financial instruments

 

operating segments

 

our business comprises two operating segments real estate operations and strategic capital 

 

below is information summarizing consolidated activity within our segments over the last three years in millions

 

  

 



 



 

 

real estate operations

 

rental rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contribute 85 to 90 of our consolidated revenues earnings and funds from operations “ffo” ffo is a nongaap financial measure see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information we collect rent from our customers through longterm operating leases including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs we expect to generate longterm internal growth by increasing rents maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses the primary driver of our revenue growth will be rolling inplace leases to current market rents coupled with increasing market rents we believe our active portfolio management combined with the skills of our property leasing maintenance capital energy sustainability and risk management teams will allow us to maximize rental revenues across our portfolio a significant amount of our rental revenues noi and cash flows are generated in the us 

 

development we develop properties to meet our customers’ needs deepen our market presence and refresh our portfolio quality we believe we have a competitive advantage due to i the strategic locations of our land bank ii the development expertise of our local teams and iii the depth of our customer relationships successful development and redevelopment efforts provide significant earnings growth as projects lease up and generate income and increase the net asset value of our real estate operations segment based on our current estimates our consolidated land bank excluding land we have under option contracts has the potential to support the development of 77 billion of tei of new logistics space generally we develop properties in the us for longterm hold and outside the us for contribution to our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures 

 

strategic capital

 

real estate is a capitalintensive business that requires new capital to grow our strategic capital business gives us access to thirdparty capital both private and public allowing us to diversify our sources of capital and providing us with a broad range of options to fund our growth while reducing our exposure to foreign currency movements for investments outside of the us we partner with some of the world’s largest institutional investors to grow our business and provide incremental revenues with a focus on longterm and openended ventures we also access alternative sources of equity through two publicly traded vehicles nippon prologis reit inc in japan and fibra prologis in mexico we align our interests with those of our partners by holding significant ownership interests in all of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures ranging from 15 to 50

 

this segment produces stable longterm cash flows and generally contributes 10 to 15 of our consolidated revenues earnings and ffo we generate strategic capital revenues or fees from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures principally through asset and property management services substantially all of these revenues and fees are earned from longterm and openended ventures we earn additional revenues by providing leasing acquisition construction development financing legal and disposition services in certain ventures we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees “promotes” or “promote revenues” periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation we plan to profitably grow this business by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures most of the strategic capital revenues are generated outside the us noi in this segment is calculated directly from our consolidated financial statements as strategic capital revenues less strategic capital expenses and excludes propertyrelated noi

 

future growth

 

we believe the quality and scale of our global portfolio the expertise of our team the depth of our customer relationships and the strength of our balance sheet give us unique competitive advantages to grow revenues noi earnings ffo and cash flows 

 

  

 



 



 



 

competition 

 

real estate ownership is generally fragmented and we therefore face competition from many owners and operators competitively priced logistics space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge which in turn could affect our operating results we may face competition regarding our capital deployment activities including local regional and national operators or developers we also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business

 

despite the competition we may face our strategic focus over the years has given us distinct competitive advantages

 

these competitive advantages encompass the following

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

customers

environmental matters

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired including land while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see further discussion in item 1a risk factors and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

 

insurance coverage

 

we carry insurance coverage on our properties we determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance selfinsurance and a whollyowned captive insurance entity the costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through reimbursements from our customers we believe our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured see further discussion in item 1a risk factors

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition including but not limited to our financial position results of operations cash flow ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market value of our securities these risks relate to prologis as well as our investments in consolidated and unconsolidated entities and include among others i general risks ii risks related to our business iii risks related to financing and capital and iv income tax risks

 

general risks

 

as a global company we are subject to social political and economic risks of doing business in many countries

 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the us during 2018 we generated approximately 557 million or 198 of our revenues from operations outside the us circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect us include but are not limited to the following factors

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

in addition we may be impacted by the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other factors

 

disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition

 

to the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect i the value of our properties ii the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing iii our ability to make principal and interest payments on or refinance any outstanding debt when due and iv the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities

 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks

 

despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks such as computer viruses or unauthorized access any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business we may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws unauthorized access to information of ours and others significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business 

 

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel

 

we depend on the deep industry knowledge and the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees from time to time our personnel and their roles may change while we believe that we are able to retain our key talent and find suitable employees to meet our personnel needs the loss of key personnel any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our business if we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected

 

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting

 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements or a decline in the price of our securities

 

the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position

 

we hold significant real estate investments in international markets where the us dollar is not the functional currency at december 31 2018 approximately 73 billion or 191 of our total consolidated assets were invested in a currency other than the us dollar principally the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen for the year ended december 31 2018 509 million or 182 of our total 

consolidated revenue was denominated in foreign currencies as a result we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a signi ficant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our business and specifically our us dollar reported financial position and results of operations we attempt to mitigate our risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we have significant investments thereby providing a natural hedge we may also enter into derivative financial instruments that we designate as net investment hedges as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments we enter into other foreign currency contracts such as forwards to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flow associ ated with the translation of future earnings of our international subsidiaries at december 31 2018 after consideration of our derivative and nonderivative financial instruments we had minimal net equity denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  although we attempt to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in foreign currency rates there can be no assurance that those attempts will be successful 

 

our hedging of foreign currency and interest rate risk may not effectively limit our exposure to other risks

 

hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency or interest rates and the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements the funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of the hedged foreign currency or the size of the underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of the breakage the failure to hedge effectively against foreign exchange changes or interest rate changes may adversely affect our business 

 

compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs

 

we are required to comply with many regulations in different countries including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar laws and regulations our properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as the americans with disabilities act and state and local fire and lifesafety requirements noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants while we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us

 

risks related to our business

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets which may reduce economic returns to investors

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as secured mortgage debt payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments as a reit under the internal revenue code we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable reit subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment to generate liquidity if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale we may not pursue such sales

 

we may decide to sell properties to certain of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures or third parties to generate proceeds to fund our capital deployment activities our ability to sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by i competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties ii market conditions including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties and iii other factors beyond our control if our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or at all the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital in the private and public markets in order to acquire properties from us should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then dispositions could be delayed 

 

if we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations sales or contributions of properties or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation divesting properties whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term at less than optimal terms incurring debt entering into leases with new customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates there can be no assurance however that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us additionally taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our business and in particular our distributable cash flow and debt covenants

 

our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector

 

our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the logistics sector this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified

 

general economic conditions and o ther events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results 

 

we are exposed to general economic conditions local regional national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties

 

at december 31 2018 347 of our consolidated operating properties or 107 billion based on consolidated gross book value or investment before depreciation were located in california central valley san francisco bay area and southern california markets which represented 280 of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 325 of our noi our revenues from and the value of our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for logistics properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california’s economic climate because of the investment we have located in california a downturn in california’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to california we also have significant holdings defined as more than 3 of total consolidated investment before depreciation in operating properties in certain markets located in atlanta central and eastern pennsylvania chicago dallasfort worth houston new jerseynew york city seattle and south florida of these markets no single market contributed more than 10 of our total consolidated investment before depreciation our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties conditions such as an oversupply of logistics space or a reduction in demand for logistics space among other factors may impact operating conditions any material oversupply of logistics space or material reduction in demand for logistics space could adversely affect our overall business 

 

our om portfolio which includes our whollyowned properties and properties included in our coinvestment ventures has concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above as well as in markets in france japan mexico and the uk and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets

 

a number of our investments both whollyowned and owned through coinvestment ventures are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity us properties located in active seismic areas include properties in our markets in california and seattle international properties located in active seismic areas include japan and mexico we generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to selfinsure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis we have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for our assets in japan based on this analysis

 

furthermore a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane or flood risk we carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants 

 

investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business

 

investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio market research and our asset management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated factors that may affect real estate values and cash flows include

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

our customers may be unable to meet their lease obligations or we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or release space on favorable terms as leases expire

 

our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations at december 31 2018 our top 10 customers totaled 151 of our ner in the event of default by a significant number of customers we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord and we may 

be unable to release spaces a customer may experience a downturn in its business which m ay cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease in addition a customer may seek the prot ection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow 

 

we are also subject to the risk that upon the expiration of leases they may not be renewed by existing customers the space may not be released to new customers or the terms of renewal or releasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers we may lose potential customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire 

 

we may acquire properties which involves risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

 

we have acquired properties and will continue to acquire properties both through the direct acquisition of real estate and through the acquisition of entities that own the real estate and through additional investments in coinvestment ventures that acquire properties the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates when we acquire properties we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures additionally there is and it is expected there will continue to be significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities the acquired properties or entities may be subject to liabilities which may be without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based on ownership of any of these entities or properties then we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it 

 

our real estate development strategies may not be successful

 

our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through development of logistics facilities to hold for longterm investment contribution or sale to a coinvestment venture or third party depending on market conditions our liquidity needs and other factors we may increase our investment in the development renovation and redevelopment business and we expect to complete the buildout and leasing of our current development portfolio we may also develop renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed coinvestment ventures the real estate development renovation and redevelopment business includes the following significant risks

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming coinvestment ventures investing in new or existing coinvestment ventures attracting thirdparty investment and managing properties through coinvestment ventures

 

at december 31 2018 we had investments in real estate of approximately 406 million square feet held through coinvestment ventures both public and private our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in these 

ventures and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through coinvestment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances however there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new coinve stment ventures or attract thirdparty investment or that additional investments in new or existing ventures to develop or acquire properties will be successful further there can be no assurance that we are able to realize value from such investments 

 

our coinvestment ventures involve certain additional risks that we do not otherwise face including

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our coinvestment ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives however we may not be able to continue to do so indefinitely we have formed publicly traded investment vehicles such as npr and fibra prologis for which we serve as sponsor or manager we have contributed and may continue to contribute assets into such vehicles there is a risk that our managerial relationship may be terminated 

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition

 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination

 

environmental laws in some countries including the us also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of our properties are known to contain asbestoscontaining building materials

 

in addition some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances furthermore certain of our properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in connection with certain divested properties we have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties

 

we are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition

 

we are also exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate our logistics facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events such as severe storms or floods if the frequency of extreme weather events increases our exposure to these events could increase we do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change as the operation of our buildings typically does not generate a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions however we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain or stricter energy efficiency standards or greenhouse gas regulations for the commercial building sectors we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the potential impacts of future climate change on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral

 

our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses 

 

we and our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy namely windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets we believe our properties and the properties of our coinvestment ventures are adequately insured certain losses however including losses from floods earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots generally are not insured against or not fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property

 

furthermore we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties and if there is recourse debt then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our business 

 

risks related to financing and capital

 

we may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments

 

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and if the maturing debt is secured the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness our credit facilities and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements

 

covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition

 

the terms of our various credit agreements including our credit facilities the indentures under which our senior notes and term loans are issued and other note agreements require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage leverage ratios fixed charge ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness if we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations our business and financial condition generally and in particular the amount of our distributable cash flow could be adversely affected 

 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity

 

the credit ratings of our senior notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing also a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our credit facilities and other debt instruments adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and in particular our refinancing and other capital market activities our ability to manage debt maturities our future growth and our development and acquisition activity

 

at december 31 2018 our credit ratings were a3 from moody’s and a from sp both with stable outlook a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization

 

in order to meet reit distribution requirements we may need access to external sources of capital

 

to qualify as a reit we are required each year to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders and we may be subject to tax to the extent our taxable income is not fully distributed historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders however we may elect to pay a portion of the distribution in shares of our stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital furthermore to maintain our reit status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm 

borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion o f income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all depends on a numbe r of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities 

 

our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock or units in the op

 

any additional future issuance of common stock or op units will reduce the percentage of our common stock and units owned by investors in most circumstances stockholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock or units in addition depending on the terms and pricing of any additional offering of our common stock or units and the value of the properties our stockholders and unitholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock or units

 

income tax risks

 

the failure of prologis inc to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences

 

prologis inc elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code commencing with the taxable year ended december 31 1997 we believe prologis inc has been organized and operated to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable prologis inc to continue to qualify as a reit however it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow prologis inc to qualify as a reit or that our future operations could cause prologis inc to fail to qualify qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some annually and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex sections of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control for example to qualify as a reit prologis inc must derive at least 95 of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition prologis inc must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders but we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances our own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years that end on or before december 31 and in some cases declared as late as december 31 a reit can satisfy up to 90 of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of other property or shares of our stock if certain conditions are met  the provisions of the internal revenue code and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a reit are more complicated for prologis inc because we hold substantially all of our assets through the op

 

if prologis inc fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be required to pay federal income tax including for taxable years prior to 2018 any applicable alternative minimum tax on taxable income at regular corporate rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions prologis inc would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it lost the qualification if prologis inc lost its reit status our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved

 

furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits that elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit 95 gross income test to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to us federal income tax in addition a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect on the ability of prologis inc to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus its ability to qualify as a reit

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction

 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties including by contributing properties to our coinvestment ventures under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions while we believe that the internal revenue service would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

 

legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us 

 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the us and foreign income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate reits similar entities and investments additional changes are likely to continue to occur in the future both in and outside of the us and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this report and the matters described under item 1a risk factors

 

management’s overview

 

summary of 2018

 

during the year ended december 31 2018 operating fundamentals remained strong for our om portfolio and we ended the year with occupancy of 975 see below for the results of our two business segments and details of operating activity of our om portfolio

 

in 2018 we completed the following significant activities as further described in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

this debt activity resulted in extending our debt maturities to 76 months and lowering our effective interest rate to 27 both on a weightedaverage basis

 



 



 

in january 2019 we formed pblv a brazilian unconsolidated coinvestment venture with one partner we contributed an initial portfolio of real estate properties to pblv consisting of 14 operating properties totaling 7 million square feet and 371 acres of land we received cash proceeds and units for our 20 equity interest 

 

we ended 2018 with vacancies at historic lows strong customer and investor demand leases signed with record long terms and a strong balance sheet we have seen no signs of slowness based on our operating metrics and remain positive on our outlook however given the current market volatility caused by current trade and tariff disputes and uncertainty with regard to the withdrawal of the uk from the european union we will continue to be prudent in running our business

 

results of operations 

 

we evaluate our business operations based on the noi of our two operating segments real estate operations and strategic capital noi by segment is a nongaap financial measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements we consider noi by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps management and investors understand our core operations 

 

below is a reconciliation of our noi by segment to operating income per the consolidated financial statements in millions each segment’s noi is reconciled to a line item in the consolidated financial statements in the respective segment discussion below

 



see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our segments and a reconciliation of each business segment’s noi to operating income and earnings before income taxes 

 

real estate operations

 

this operating segment principally includes rental revenues rental recoveries and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties we allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses and the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios the operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to be strong which has increased rents kept occupancies high and fueled development activity in addition this segment is impacted by our development acquisition and disposition activities

 

below are the components of real estate operations revenues expenses and noi in millions derived directly from line items in the cons olidated financial statements 

 



 

the change in real estate operations noi during these periods was impacted by the following items dollars in millions 

  

 



 



 



 



 



 

below are key operating metrics of our consolidated operating portfolio beginning january 1 2018 we modified certain definitions of our operating metrics to align methodologies with members of the industrial reit group these changes were retroactively applied for all prior periods presented 

 

  

 



 



 

development start activity

 

the following table summarizes consolidated development starts dollars and square feet in millions

 



 

development stabilization activity

 

the following table summarizes consolidated development stabilization activity dollars and square feet in millions

 



 



 

at december 31 2018 our development portfolio including properties under development and prestabilized properties was 508 leased and expected to be completed before july 2020 for additional information on our development portfolio at december 31 2018 see item 2 properties

 

capital expenditures

 

we capitalize costs incurred in renovating and improving our operating properties as part of the investment basis the following graph summarizes our total capital expenditures and capital expenditures per average square foot of our consolidated operating properties during each year

 

 

strategic capital

 

this operating segment includes revenues from asset and property management and other fees for services performed as well as promote revenues earned from the unconsolidated ventures revenues associated with the strategic capital segment fluctuate because of changes in the number of real estate assets through acquisitions and dispositions and the fair value of the properties owned by the ventures the transactional activity in the ventures foreign currency exchange rates and the timing of promotes these revenues are reduced generally by the direct costs associated with the asset and propertylevel management expenses for the properties owned by these ventures we allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses and to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios

 

below are the components of strategic capital revenues expenses and noi derived directly from the line items in the consolidated financial statements in millions 

 



below is additional detail of our strategic capital revenues expenses and noi in millions

 





 



 



 



 

the following real estate investments were held through our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures based on historical cost at december 31 dollars and square feet in millions

 



see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures

 

ga expenses

 

ga expenses were 239 million 231 million and 222 million for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively ga expenses increased marginally over the last three years due to inflationary increases and higher compensation expenses based on our performance 

 

we capitalize certain internal costs directly related to our development and leasing activities capitalized ga expenses primarily included salaries and related costs the following table summarizes capitalized ga amounts in millions 

 



 



 

depreciation and amortization expenses

 

depreciation and amortization expenses were 947 million 879 million and 931 million for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively

 

the following table highlights the key changes in depreciation and amortization ex penses during these periods  dollars in millions  

  

 



 



 

our om operating portfolio

 

we manage our business and review our operating fundamentals on an om basis which includes properties wholly owned by us or owned by one of our coinvestment ventures we believe reviewing these fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact to the financial statements as it will affect both the real estate operations and strategic capital segments as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures based on our ownership we do not control the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures for purposes of gaap and the presentation of the ventures’ operating information does not represent a legal claim 

 

our om operating portfolio does not include valueadded properties or properties held for sale to third parties and was as follows at december 31 square feet in millions

 



 

below are the key operating metrics summarizing the leasing activity of our om operating portfolio beginning january 1 2018 we modified certain definitions of our operating metrics to align methodologies with members of the industrial reit group these changes were retroactively applied for all prior periods presented 

 

  

 



 



 

same store analysis

 

our same store metrics are nongaap financial measures which are commonly used in the real estate industry and expected from the financial community on both a neteffective and cash basis we evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period which allows us to analyze our ongoing business operations 

 

we define our same store population for the three months ended december 31 2018 as our om properties that were in the operating portfolio at january 1 2017 and owned throughout the end of the same threemonth period in both 2018 and 2017 the same store population excludes nonindustrial real estate properties and properties held for sale to third parties along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period january 1 2017 and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period beginning january 1 2018 we modified our definition of same store to align on consistent methodologies with members of the industrial reit group this did not materially change our historical amounts reported to derive an appropriate measure of periodtoperiod operating performance we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the reported period end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the us dollar for both periods we believe the factors that affect rental revenues rental recoveries rental expenses and noi in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for our consolidated portfolio 

 

as same store is a nongaap financial measure it has certain limitations as an analytical tool and may vary among real estate companies as a result we provide a reconciliation of rental revenues rental recoveries and rental expenses from our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap to same store property noi in addition we further remove certain noncash items straightline rent adjustments and amortization of lease intangibles included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap to reflect a cash same store number to clearly label these metrics they are categorized as same store portfolio noi – net effective and same store portfolio noi – cash

 

we evaluate the results of our same store portfolio on a quarterly basis the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues rental recoveries rental expenses and property noi for each quarter in 2018 and 2017 to the full year as included in the consolidated statements of income and within note 19 to the consolidated financial statements and to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended december 31 dollars in millions

 



 



 



 



 



 

other components of income expense

 

earnings from unconsolidated entities net

 

we recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities which are accounted for using the equity method of 298 million 249 million and 206 million during 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the earnings we recognize can be impacted by i variances in revenues and expenses of each venture ii the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture iii gains or losses from the dispositions of properties and extinguishment of debt iv our ownership interest in each venture and v fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to us dollars

 

see the discussion of our coinvestment ventures above in the strategic capital segment discussion and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized

 

interest expense 

 

the following table details our net interest expense dollars in millions

 



 

our overall debt increased by 17 billion from december 31 2017 to december 31 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of dct on august 22 2018 subsequent to the acquisition of dct we paid down 18 billion of the assumed debt through the issuance of senior notes at significantly lower interest rates than the assumed debt gross interest expense decreased in 2018 from the same period in 2017 principally due to lower interest rates and average debt balances during the period gross interest expense decreased in 2017 from the same period in 2016 principally due to decreased secured mortgage debt as a result of the uslf contribution and pay downs and lower interest rates due to the change in the composition of our senior notes 

 

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs

 

gains on real estate transactions net

 

during 2018 2017 and 2016 we recognized gains on real estate transactions net of 841 million 12 billion and 757 million respectively we utilized the proceeds from both contributions and dispositions to fund our capital investments during the threeyear period ended december 31 2018

 

over the last three years we contributed properties generally that we developed to our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures principally in europe japan and mexico we also sold properties to third parties primarily from our operating portfolio in the us in 2017 we contributed a significant portfolio of operating properties to uslf as of the year ended december 31 2018 we completed our om disposition program of nonstrategic assets that began in 2011 through this program we generated approximately 14 billion in proceeds resulting in our om operating portfolio being focused on the highestquality properties in the best markets we expect to continue to develop and contribute properties to our coinvestment ventures depending on market conditions and other factors 

 

beginning january 1 2018 under the new revenue recognition standard as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we recognized the entire gain attributed to contributions of real estate properties to unconsolidated coinvestment ventures we previously recognized a gain to the extent of the thirdparty ownership in the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures acquiring the property  for deferred gains from sales recorded prior to the adoption we will continue to recognize these gains over the lives of the underlying real estate properties or at the time of disposition to a third party 

 

see notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the gains we recognized

 

foreign currency and derivative gains losses net

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative financial instrument policies and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our derivative and nonderivative transactions

 

gains losses on early extinguishment of debt net

 

in 2018 we recognized a loss of 2 million upon extinguishment of the 18 billion of debt assumed in the dct transaction the loss represents the excess of the prepayment penalties of 49 million over the 47 million premium recorded upon assumption of this debt we repurchased and redeemed portions of several series of senior notes term loans and secured mortgage debt that resulted in the recognition of a 68 million loss in 2017 and a 2 million gain in 2016 through these activities over the last three years we reduced our effective interest rate and lengthened the maturities of our debt see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section for more information regarding our debt repurchases

 

income tax expense

 

we recognize income tax expense related to our taxable reit subsidiaries and in the local state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income deferred income tax expense benefit is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries

 

the following table summarizes our income tax expense benefit in millions

 



 

our income taxes are discussed in more detail in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests

 

this amount represents the thirdparty investors’ share of the earnings generated in consolidated entities in which we do not own 100 of the equity reduced by the thirdparty share of fees or promotes payable to us and earned during the period we had net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of 174 million 109 million and 83 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively included in these amounts were 49 million 45 million and 35 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively of net earnings attributable to the common limited partnership unitholders of prologis lp

at december 31 2018 we did not guarantee any thirdparty debt of the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures in our role as the manager or sponsor we work with the coinvestment ventures to maintain sufficient liquidity and refinance their maturing debt there can be no assurance that the coinvestment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt or at all if the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets certain of our ventures also have credit facilities or unencumbered properties both of which may be used to obtain funds

 

contractual obligations

 

longterm contractual obligations

 

the following table summarizes our longterm contractual obligations at december 31 2018 in millions

 



 



 



 

distribution and dividend requirements

 

our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the internal revenue code relative to maintaining our reit status while still allowing us to retain cash to fund capital improvements and other investment activities 

 

under the internal revenue code reits may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 did not modify our current distribution policy see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the tax cuts and jobs act 

 

we paid quarterly cash dividends of 048 044 and 042 per common share in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively our future common stock dividends if and as declared may vary and will be determined by the board upon the circumstances prevailing at the 

time including our financial condition operating results and reit distribution requirements and may be adju sted at the discretion of the board during the year 

 

we make distributions on the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend the class a units in the op are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to 064665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least 040 per unit we paid a quarterly distribution of 064665 per class a unit in 2018 2017 and 2016 

 

at december 31 2018 we had 14 million shares of series q preferred stock outstanding with a liquidation preference of 50 per share the annual dividend rate is 854 per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock

 

other commitments

 

on a continuing basis we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties

 

critical accounting policies

 

a critical accounting policy is one that involves an estimate or assumption that is subjective and requires judgment on the part of management about the effect of a matter that is inherently uncertain and is material to an entity’s financial condition and results of operations estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance of the significant accounting policies discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements those presented below have been identified by us as meeting the criteria to be considered critical accounting policies refer to note 2 for more information on these critical accounting policies

 

acquisitions

 

we generally account for an acquisition of a single property or portfolio of properties as an asset acquisition we measure the real estate assets acquired through an asset acquisition based on their cost or total consideration exchanged and any excess consideration or bargain purchase amount is allocated to the real estate properties excluding those identified as held for sale on a relative fair value basis

 

we make estimates as part of our valuation of the assumed assets and liabilities at the acquisition date the components of an acquisition typically include buildings land improvements intangible assets or liabilities related to the acquired leases debt deferred tax liabilities and other assumed assets and liabilities the purchase price allocation is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located utilizing an income approach methodology which may be a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated noi of a property key assumptions include market rents growth rates and discount and capitalization rates estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results known trends and market and economic conditions we determine discount and capitalization rates by market based on recent transactions and other market data the fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale the use of different assumptions to value the acquired properties and intangible assets and assumed liabilities could affect the future revenues and expenses we recognize over the estimated remaining useful life or lease term

 

recoverability of real estate assets

 

we assess the carrying values of our respective longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable

 

recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models applying a capitalization rate to the estimated noi of a property quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals where considered necessary the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to hold is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property assumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows including market rents discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

 

funds from operations attributable to common stockholdersunitholders 

 

ffo is a nongaap financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings

 

the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales along with impairment charges of previously depreciated properties we also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties we exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties’ share of our consolidated coinvestment ventures

 

our ffo measures

 

our ffo measures begin with nareit’s definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy while not infrequent or unusual the additional items we adjust for in calculating ffo as modified by prologis and core ffo  both as defined below are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term these items have both positive and negative shortterm effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our longterm outlook

 

we calculate our ffo measures as defined below based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures we reflect our share of our ffo measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our ffo measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods

 

these ffo measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses we do not use our ffo measures as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap as indicators of our operating performance as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs

 

we analyze our operating performance principally by the rental revenues of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business net of operating administrative and financing expenses this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities

 

ffo as modified by prologis attributable to common stockholdersunitholders “ffo as modified by prologis”

 

to arrive at ffo as modified by prologis  we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax specifically

 



 



 



 



 



 

we use ffo as modified by prologis  so that management analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other reits that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the us

 

core ffo attributable to common stockholdersunitholders “core ffo”

 

in addition to ffo as modified by prologis  we also use core ffo to arrive at core ffo we adjust ffo as modified by prologis  to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly in ffo as modified by prologis 

 



 



 



 



 



 

we use core ffo  including by segment and region to i assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies ii evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods iii evaluate the performance of our management iv budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources v provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance and vi evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results

 

limitations on the use of our ffo measures

 

while we believe our modified ffo measures are important supplemental measures neither nareit’s nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are therefore limited as an analytical tool accordingly these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business some of the limitations are

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions this information should b e read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap to assist investors in compensating for these limitations we reconcile our modified ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap in millions

we are exposed to the impact of foreign exchangerelated variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments and interest rate changes see our risk factors in item 1a risk factors specifically the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and we may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments see also notes 2 and 15 in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information about our foreign operations and derivative financial instruments

 

we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates at december 31 2018 the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following sections the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value as a result revenues and expenses as well as our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates

 

foreign currency risk

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange variability related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our results of operations or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge we may designate the debt as a nonderivative net investment hedge we may also hedge our foreign currency risk by entering into derivative financial instruments that we designate as net investment hedges as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments at december 31 2018 after consideration of our derivative and nonderivative financial instruments as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we had minimal net equity denominated in a currency other than the us dollar

 

for the year ended december 31 2018 509 million or 182 of our total consolidated revenue was denominated in foreign currencies we enter into other foreign currency contracts such as forwards to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency associated with the translation of the future earnings of our international subsidiaries we have brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen forward contracts which were not designated as hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of 669 million to mitigate risk associated with the translation of the future earnings of our subsidiaries denominated in these currencies 

a lthough the impact to net earnings is mitigated through higher trans lated us dollar earnings from these currencies a weakening of the us dollar against these c urrencies by 10 c ould result in a  67 million cash payment on settlement of these contracts  

 

interest rate risk

 

we are also exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows to mitigate that risk we generally borrow with fixed rate debt and we may use derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on our variable rate debt at december 31 2018 92 billion of our debt bore interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates at december 31 2018 18 billion of our debt bore interest at variable rates the following table summarizes the principal payments including net premium and debt issuance costs by maturity date at december 31 2018 in millions 

 



 



 



 

at december 31 2018 the weighted average effective interest rate on our variable rate debt was 18 changes in interest rates can cause interest expense to fluctuate on our variable rate debt on the basis of our sensitivity analysis a 10 increase in interest rates based on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances not subject to interest rate swap agreements would result in additional annual interest expense of 4 million for the year ended december 31 2018 which equates to a change in interest rates of 19 basis points

 item 1 business

 

prologis inc is a selfadministered and selfmanaged reit and is the sole general partner of prologis lp we operate prologis inc and prologis lp as one enterprise and therefore our discussion and analysis refers to prologis inc and its consolidated subsidiaries including prologis lp collectively we invest in real estate through wholly owned subsid iaries and other entities through which we coinvest with partners and investors we maintain a significant level of ownership in these coinvestment ventures which may be consolidated or unconsolidated based on our level of control of the entity

 

prologis inc began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended “internal revenue code” we believe the current organization and method of operation will enable prologis inc to maintain its status as a reit prologis lp was also formed in 1997

 

we operate our business on an owned and managed basis including properties that we wholly own and properties that are owned by one of our coinvestment ventures we make decisions based on the property operations regardless of our ownership interest therefore we generally evaluate operating metrics on an owned and managed basis

 

our corporate headquarters is located at pier 1 bay 1 san francisco california 94111 and our other principal office locations are in amsterdam denver luxembourg mexico city shanghai singapore and tokyo

 

our internet address is wwwprologiscom  all reports required to be filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” are available and can be accessed free of charge through the investor relations section of our website wwwprologiscom  the common stock of prologis inc is listed on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the ticker “pld” and is a component of the standard  poor’s “sp” 500

 

the company

 

prologis is the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on highbarrier highgrowth markets in 19 countries we own manage and develop welllocated highquality logistics facilities in the world’s busiest consumption markets our local teams actively manage our portfolio which encompasses leasing and property management capital deployment and opportunistic dispositions allowing us to recycle capital to fund our development and acquisition activities the majority of our properties in the united states “us” are wholly owned while our properties outside the us are generally held in coinvestment ventures reducing our exposure to foreign currency movements 

 

our portfolio benefits from key drivers of economic activity including consumption supply chain modernization ecommerce and urbanization in the developed markets of the us europe and japan key factors are the reconfiguration of supply chains strongly influenced by ecommerce trends and the operational efficiencies that can be realized from our modern logistics facilities in emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico new affluence and the rise of a new consumer class have increased the need for modern distribution networks our strategy is to own the highestquality logistics property portfolio in each of our target markets these markets are characterized by large population densities and consumption and typically offer proximity to large labor pools and are supported by extensive transportation infrastructure major airports seaports and rail and highway networks customers turn to us because they know an efficient supply chain will make their businesses run better and that a strategic relationship with prologis will create a competitive advantage 

 

 

at december 31 2017 we owned or had investments in on a whollyowned basis or through coinvestment ventures properties and development projects based on gross book value and total expected investment “tei” totaling 575 billion across 684 million square feet 64 million square meters across four continents our investment totals 329 billion and consists of our whollyowned properties and our pro rata or ownership share of the properties owned by our coinvestment ventures we lease modern logistics facilities to a diverse base of approximately 5000 customers

 

 

throughout this document we reflect amounts in us dollars our reporting currency included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated into us dollars we mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by investing outside the us through coinvestment ventures borrowing in local currency and utilizing derivative financial instruments at december 31 2017 944 of our net equity calculated on a gross book value basis is denominated in us dollars including our proportionate share of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures and derivative financial instruments

 

operating segments

 

our business comprises two operating segments real estate operations and strategic capital 

 



 

 

real estate operations 

 

rental rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contributes 90 of our consolidated revenues earnings and funds from operations “ffo” see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on ffo a nongaap measure we collect rent from our customers through operating leases including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs we expect to generate longterm internal growth by increasing rents maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses the primary drivers of our rent growth will be rolling inplace leases to current market rents we believe our active portfolio management coupled with the skills of our property leasing maintenance capital energy and risk management teams will allow us to maximize rental revenues across our portfolio most of our rental revenues and noi are generated in the us noi from this segment is calculated directly from our financial statements as rental revenues rental recoveries and development management and other revenues less rental expenses and other expenses 

 

development we develop properties to meet our customers’ needs deepen our market presence and refresh our portfolio quality we believe we have a competitive advantage due to i the strategic locations of our land bank ii the development expertise of our local teams and iii the depth of our customer relationships successful development and redevelopment efforts increase both the rental revenues and the net asset value of our real estate operations segment we measure the development value we create based on the estimated fair value of a stabilized development property as compared to the costs incurred we develop properties in the us for longterm hold or contribution to our unconsolidated coinvestment venture and outside the us we develop primarily for contribution to our coinvestment ventures occasionally we develop for sale to third parties 

 

strategic capital 

 

real estate is a capitalintensive business that requires new capital to grow our strategic capital business gives us access to thirdparty capital both private and public allowing us to diversify our sources of capital and providing us with a broad range of options to fund our growth while reducing our exposure to foreign currency movements for investments outside the us we partner with some of the world’s largest institutional investors to grow our business and provide incremental revenues with a focus on longterm and openended ventures also referred to as “perpetual vehicles” we also access alternative sources of equity through two publicly traded vehicles nippon prologis reit inc in japan and fibra prologis in mexico we hold significant ownership interests in all of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures approximately 29 weighted average ownership based on each entity’s contribution of total assets before depreciation net of other liabilities at december 31 2017 aligning our interests with those of our partners 

 

this segment produces stable longterm cash flows and generally contributes 10 of our consolidated revenues earnings and ffo we generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures primarily through asset and property management services of which 90 are earned from longterm and openended ventures we earn additional revenues by providing leasing acquisition construction development financing legal and disposition services in certain ventures we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees “promotes” periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation we plan to profitably grow this business by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures generally the majority of the strategic capital revenues are generated outside the us noi in this segment is calculated directly from our financial statements as strategic capital revenues less strategic capital expenses and does not include propertyrelated noi

 

future growth

 

we believe the quality and scale of our global portfolio the expertise of our team the depth of our customer relationships and the strength of our balance sheet give us unique competitive advantages our plan to grow revenues noi earnings ffo and cash flows is based on the following

 



 



 

 



 

competition 

 

competitively priced logistics space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge which in turn could affect our operating segments we may face competition regarding our capital deployment activities including local regional and national operators or developers we also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business

 

we believe we have competitive advantages due to our

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

customers

 

our broad customer base represents a spectrum of international national regional and local logistics users at december 31 2017 in our real estate operations segment representing our consolidated properties we had more than 2800 customers occupying 299 million square feet of logistics operating properties on an owned and managed basis we had approximately 5000 customers occupying 630 million square feet of logistics operating properties 

 

 

the following table details our top 25 customers at december 31 2017 square feet in millions 

 



 



 

in our strategic capital segment we view our partners and investors as our customers at december 31 2017 in our private ventures we partnered with approximately 100 investors several of which invest in multiple ventures

 

employees 

 

the following table summarizes our employee base at december 31 2017 

 



 



 

we allocate our employees who perform property management functions to our real estate operations segment and strategic capital segment based on the square footage of the respective portfolios employees who perform only strategic capital functions are allocated directly to that segment

 

we believe we have good relationships with our employees prologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements although some employees in europe are represented by statutory works councils and as such benefit from applicable labor agreements

 

code of ethics and business conduct

 

we maintain a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to our board of directors the “board” and all of our officers and employees including the principal executive officer the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer and other people performing similar functions a copy of our code of ethics and business conduct is available on our website wwwprologiscom  in addition to being ac cessible through our website copies of our code of ethics and business conduct can be obtained free of charge upon written request to investor relations pier 1 bay 1 san francisco california 94111 any amendments to or waivers of our code 

 

of ethics and business conduct that apply to the principal executive officer the principal financial officer the principal accounting officer or other people performing similar functions and that relate to any matter enumerated in item 406b of regulation sk will be disclosed on our website 

 

environmental matters

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired including land while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see further discussion in item 1a risk factors and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

 

insurance coverage

 

we carry insurance coverage on our properties we determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance selfinsurance and a whollyowned captive insurance entity the costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through reimbursements from our customers we believe our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured see further discussion in item 1a risk factors

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition including but not limited to our financial position results of operations cash flow ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market value of our securities these risks relate to prologis as well as our investments in consolidated and unconsolidated entities and include among others i general risks ii risks related to our business iii risks related to financing and capital and iv income tax risks

 

general risks 

 

as a global company we are subject to social political and economic risks of doing business in many countries

 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the us during 2017 we generated approximately 416 million or 159 of our revenues from operations outside the us circumstances and developments related to international and us operations that could negatively affect us include but are not limited to the following factors

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

 



 



 

in addition we may be impacted by the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt due to currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other factors

 

disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition

 

to the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect i the value of our properties ii the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing iii our ability to make principal and interest payments on or refinance any outstanding debt when due and iv the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities

 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks

 

despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks such as computer viruses or unauthorized access any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business we may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws unauthorized access to information of ours and others significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business

 

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel

 

we depend on the deep industry knowledge and the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees from time to time our personnel and their roles may change while we believe that we are able to retain our key talent and find suitable employees to meet our personnel needs the loss of key personnel any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our business if we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected

 

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting

 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements or a decline in the price of our securities

 

the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position

 

we pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the functional currency at december 31 2017 approximately 74 billion or 251 of our total consolidated assets were invested in a currency other than the us dollar primarily the brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen as a result we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our business and specifically our us dollar reported financial position and results of operations and debt covenant ratios although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and using derivative contracts there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful 

 

our hedging of foreign currency and interest rate risk may not effectively limit our exposure to other risks

 

hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency or interest rates and the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements the funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of the hedged foreign currency or the size of the underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of the breakage the failure to hedge effectively against foreign exchange changes or interest rate changes may adversely affect our business 

 

 

compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs 

 

we are required to comply with many regulations in different countries including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar laws and regulations our properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as the americans with disabilities act and state and local fire and lifesafety requirements noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants while we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us if we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with these regulations we may be adversely affected

 

risks related to our business 

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets which may reduce economic returns to investors

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as secured mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments as a reit under the internal revenue code we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable reit subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment to generate liquidity if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale we may not pursue such sales

 

we may decide to sell properties to certain of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures or third parties to generate proceeds to fund our capital deployment activities our ability to sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by i competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties ii market conditions including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties and iii other factors beyond our control if our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or at all the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital in the private and public markets in order to acquire properties from us should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then dispositions could be delayed 

 

if we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations sales or contributions of properties or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation divesting ourselves of properties whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term at less than optimal terms incurring debt entering into leases with new customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates there can be no assurance however that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us additionally taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our business and in particular our distributable cash flow and debt covenants

 

our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector

 

our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the logistics sector this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified

 

general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results

 

we are exposed to general economic conditions local regional national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties

 

at december 31 2017 337 of our consolidated operating properties or 77 billion based on consolidated gross book value or investment before depreciation were located in california which represented 274 of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 341 of our noi our revenues from and the value of our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for logistics properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california’s economic climate because of the number of properties we have located in california a downturn in california’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to california we also have significant holdings defined as more than 3 of total consolidated investment before depreciation in operating properties in certain markets located in atlanta central and eastern pennsylvania chicago dallasfort worth new jerseynew york city seattle and south florida our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties conditions such as an oversupply of logistics space or a reduction in demand for logistics space among other factors may impact operating conditions any material oversupply of logistics space or material reduction in demand for logistics space could adversely affect our overall business 

 

 

our owned and managed portfolio which includes our whollyowned properties and properties included in our coinvestment ventures has concentrations of properties in the sa me markets mentioned above as well as in markets in france germany japan mexico netherlands poland and the uk and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets 

 

a number of our investments both whollyowned and owned through coinvestment ventures are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity us properties located in active seismic areas include properties in our markets in california and seattle international properties located in active seismic areas include japan and mexico we generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to selfinsure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis we have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for our assets in japan based on this analysis

 

furthermore a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane or flood risk we carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants 

 

investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business

 

investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio market research and our asset management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated factors that may affect real estate values and cash flows include

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or release space on favorable terms as leases expire

 

our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations we are also subject to the risk that upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties leases may not be renewed by existing customers the space may not be released to new customers or the terms of renewal or releasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers we may lose potential customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when our customers’ leases expire in the event of default by a significant number of customers we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord and we may be unable to release spaces a customer may experience a downturn in its business which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease in addition a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow

 

we may acquire properties which involves risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

 

we have acquired properties and will continue to acquire properties both through the direct acquisition of real estate and through the acquisition of entities that own the real estate and through additional investments in coinvestment ventures that acquire properties the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates when we acquire properties we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures additionally there is and it is expected there will continue to be significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities the acquired properties or entities may be subject to liabilities which may be without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based on ownership of any of these entities or properties then we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it 

 

 

our real estate development strategies may not be successful

 

our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through development of logistics facilities to hold for longterm investment contribution or sale to a coinvestment venture or third party depending on market conditions our liquidity needs and other factors we may increase our investment in the development renovation and redevelopment business and we expect to complete the buildout and leasing of our current development portfolio we may also develop renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed coinvestment ventures the real estate development renovation and redevelopment business includes the following significant risks

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming coinvestment ventures investing in new or existing coinvestment ventures attracting thirdparty investment and investing in and managing properties through coinvestment ventures

 

at december 31 2017 we had investments in real estate containing approximately 399 million square feet held through coinvestment ventures both public and private our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in these ventures and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through coinvestment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances however there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new coinvestment ventures or attract thirdparty investment or that additional investments in new or existing ventures to develop or acquire properties will be successful further there can be no assurance that we are able to realize value from such investments 

 

our coinvestment ventures involve certain additional risks that we do not otherwise face including

 



 



 



 



 

 



 



 

we generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our coinvestment ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives however we may not be able to continue to do so indefinitely we have formed publicly traded investment vehicles such as npr and fibra prologis for which we serve as sponsor or manager we have contributed and may continue to contribute assets into such vehicles there is a risk that our managerial relationship may be terminated 

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks including the potential impacts of future climate change which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition

 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination

 

environmental laws in some countries including the us also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of our properties are known to contain asbestoscontaining building materials

 

in addition some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances furthermore certain of our properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in connection with certain divested properties we have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties

 

we are also exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate our logistics facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events such as severe storms or floods if the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change our exposure to these events could increase we do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change as our operations generally do not emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases however we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain or stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the presence of such substances on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral

 

our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses 

 

we and our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy namely windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets we believe our properties and the properties of our coinvestment ventures are adequately insured certain losses however including losses from floods earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots generally are not insured against or not fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property

 

furthermore we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties and if there 

 

is recourse debt then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affe ct our business 

 

risks related to financing and capital 

 

we may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments

 

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and if the maturing debt is secured the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness our credit facilities and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements

 

covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition

 

the terms of our various credit agreements including our credit facilities the indentures under which our senior notes are issued and other note agreements require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage leverage ratios fixed charge ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness if we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations our business and financial condition generally and in particular the amount of our distributable cash flow could be adversely affected 

 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity

 

the credit ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing also a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our credit facilities and other debt instruments adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and in particular our refinancing and other capital market activities our ability to manage debt maturities our future growth and our development and acquisition activity

 

at december 31 2017 our credit ratings were a3 from moody’s and a from sp both with stable outlook a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization

 

we depend on external sources of capital

 

to qualify as a reit we are required each year to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders and we may be subject to tax to the extent our taxable income is not fully distributed historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders but we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances our own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years that end on or before december 31 and in some cases declared as late as december 31 a reit can satisfy up to 90 of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital furthermore to maintain our reit status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all depends on a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities

 

our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock or units in the op

 

any additional future issuance of common stock or op units will reduce the percentage of our common stock and units owned by investors in most circumstances stockholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock or units in addition depending on the terms and pricing of any additional offering of our common stock or units and the value of the properties our stockholders and unitholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock or units

 

 

income tax risks 

 

the failure of prologis inc to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences

 

prologis inc elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code commencing with the taxable year ended december 31 1997 we believe prologis inc has been organized and operated to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable prologis inc to continue to qualify as a reit however it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow prologis inc to qualify as a reit or that our future operations could cause prologis inc to fail to qualify qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some annually and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex sections of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control for example to qualify as a reit prologis inc must derive at least 95 of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition prologis inc must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis the provisions of the internal revenue code and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a reit are more complicated for prologis inc because we hold assets through the op

 

if prologis inc fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be required to pay federal income tax including for taxable years prior to 2018 any applicable alternative minimum tax on taxable income at regular corporate rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions prologis inc would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it lost the qualification if prologis inc lost its reit status our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved

 

furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits that elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit 95 gross income test to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to us federal income tax in addition a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect on the ability of prologis inc to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus its ability to qualify as a reit

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction

 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties including by contributing properties to our coinvestment ventures under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions while we believe that the internal revenue service would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

 

legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us

 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the us and foreign income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate reits similar entities and investments additional changes are likely to continue to occur in the future both in and outside of the us and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders new tax legislation was enacted on december 22 2017 and provides for significant changes to the us federal income tax laws including the reduction of the corporate tax rate a reduction or elimination of certain deductions including new limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and significant changes in the taxation of earnings from nonus sources some of these changes could have an adverse impact on us our business and the results of our operations the new rules are complex and lack developed administrative guidance thus the impact of certain aspects of these provisions on us is currently unclear technical corrections or other amendments to the new rules and administrative guidance interpreting the new rules may be forthcoming at any time or may be significantly delayed

management’s overview

 

summary of 2017

 

during the year ended december 31 2017 operating fundamentals remained strong for our owned and managed portfolio and we ended the year with occupancy of 972 see below for the results of our two business segments and details of operating activity of our owned and managed portfolio

 

in 2017 we completed the following significant activities as further described in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

results of operations 

 

we evaluate our business operations based on the noi of our two operating segments real estate operations and strategic capital noi by segment is a nongaap financial measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements we consider noi by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps management and investors understand the core operations of our real estate assets 

 

 

below is a reconciliation of our noi by segment to operating income per the consolidated financial statements in millions each segment’s n oi is reconciled to a line item in the consolidated financial statements in the respective segment discussion below 

 



see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our segments and a reconciliation of each business segment’s noi to operating income and earnings before income taxes 

 

real estate operations

 

this operating segment principally includes rental revenues rental recoveries and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties we allocate the costs of our property management functions to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses and the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios as compared to our total owned and managed portfolio the operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to be strong which has driven rents higher kept occupancies high and has fueled development activity this segment is impacted by our development acquisition and disposition activities

 

below are the components of real estate operations revenues expenses and noi in millions derived directly from line items in the consolidated financial statements

 



the change in real estate operations noi during these periods were impacted by the following items in millions of dollars

 

 



 



 



 

 



 



 

below are key operating metrics of our consolidated operating portfolio over the last three years

capital expenditures 

 

we capitalize costs incurred in renovating rehabilitating and improving our operating properties as part of the investment basis the following graph summarizes our capital expenditures on operating properties within our consolidated operating portfolio in millions 

 

 

strategic capital

 

this operating segment includes revenues from asset and property management and other fees for services performed as well as promotes earned from the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures revenues associated with the strategic capital segment fluctuate because of the size of coinvestment ventures under management the transactional activity in the ventures and the timing of promotes these revenues are reduced generally by the direct costs associated with the asset and propertylevel management expenses for the properties owned by these ventures we allocate the costs of our property management functions to the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses and to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios as compared to our total owned and managed portfolio

 

below are the components of strategic capital revenues expenses and noi derived directly from the line items in the consolidated financial statements in millions 

 



below is additional detail of our strategic capital revenues expenses and noi in millions

 





 



 



 



 

 

the following real estate investments were held through our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures at december 31 dollars and square feet in millions

 





 



 



 

see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures

 

ga expenses

 

ga expenses remained relatively flat at 231 million 222 million and 217 million for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively

 

we capitalize certain costs directly related to our development and leasing activities capitalized ga expenses included salaries and related costs as well as other ga costs the following table summarizes capitalized ga amounts in millions 

 



 



 

depreciation and amortization expenses

 

the following table highlights the key changes in depreciation and amortization expenses during these periods in millions of dollars 

 

 



 



 

 

our owned and managed properties

 

we manage our business on an owned and managed basis which includes properties wholly owned by us or owned by one of our coinvestment ventures we review our operating fundamentals on an owned and managed basis we believe reviewing these fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact to the financial statements as it will affect both the real estate operations and strategic capital segments as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures based on our ownership share we do not control the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures for purposes of gaap and the presentation of the ventures’ operating information does not represent a legal claim to such items 

 

our owned and managed operating portfolio does not include valueadded properties or properties held for sale to third parties and was as follows at december 31 square feet in millions

 



 

operating activity

 

below is information summarizing the leasing activity of our owned and managed operating portfolio over the last three years

 

 



 



 

same store analysis

 

we evaluate the operating performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period which eliminates the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio we have defined the same store portfolio for the three months ended december 31 2017 as those owned and managed properties that were in operation at january 1 2016 and have been in operation throughout the same threemonth periods in both 2017 and 2016 including development properties that have been completed and available for lease we have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party or were classified as held for sale to a third party from the population for both periods we believe the factors that affect rental revenues rental recoveries rental expenses and noi in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total operating portfolio to derive an appropriate measure of periodtoperiod operating performance we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the recent period end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the us dollar for both periods

 

same store is a commonly used measure in the real estate industry our same store measures are nongaap financial measures that are calculated beginning with rental revenues rental recoveries and rental expenses from the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap as our same store measures are nongaap financial measures they have certain limitations as analytical tools and may vary among real estate companies as a result we provide a reconciliation from our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap to same store property noi with explanations of how these metrics are calculated

 

 

we evaluate the results of our same store portfolio on a quarterly basis the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues rental recoveries rental expenses and property noi for each quarter in 2017 and 2016 to the full year as included in the consolidated statements of income and within note 20 to the co nsolidated financial statements and to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended december 31 dollars in millions 

 



 





 



 



 



 

other components of income expense

 

earnings from unconsolidated entities net

 

we recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities which are accounted for using the equity method of 249 million 206 million and 159 million during 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the earnings we recognize can be impacted by i variances in revenues and expenses of each venture ii the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture iii gains or losses from the dispositions of properties and extinguishment of debt iv our ownership interest in each venture and v fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to us dollars

 

see the discussion of our coinvestment ventures above in the strategic capital segment discussion and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized

 

interest expense

 

the following table details our net interest expense dollars in millions

 



 

our overall debt decreased by 12 billion from december 31 2016 to december 31 2017 primarily from uslf assuming secured debt in conjunction with our contribution of real estate properties gross interest expense decreased in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 principally due to decreased secured debt as a result of the uslf contribution and pay downs and lower interest rates due to the change in the composition of our senior notes gross interest expense decreased in 2016 compared with 2015 principally from lower outstanding debt balances from the repayment of the senior term loan related to the ktr acquisition and lower borrowing costs during 2016 

 

see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of gross interest expense amortization and capitalized amounts included in net interest expense see the liquidity and capital resources section for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs

 

gains on dispositions of investments in real estate and revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest net

 

during 2017 2016 and 2015 we recognized gains on dispositions of investments in real estate and revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest net of 12 billion 757 million and 759 million we utilized the proceeds from both contributions and dispositions to fund our capital investments

 

over the last three years we contributed properties generally that we developed to our coinvestment ventures in europe japan and mexico in 2017 we also contributed a significant portfolio of operating properties to uslf we have also sold properties to third parties primarily from our operating portfolio in the us these dispositions have supported our strategic objective of owning a portfolio of highquality properties in the most active centers of commerce we expect to continue to develop and contribute properties to these ventures depending on market conditions and other factors

 

for the threeyear period ended december 31 2017 we recognized a gain in connection with contributions to the extent of the thirdparty ownership in the venture acquiring the property beginning in 2018 we will recognize the entire gain under the new revenue recognition standard as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

see note 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the gains we recognized

 

 

foreign currency and derivative gains losses net 

 

the following table details our foreign currency and derivative gains losses net included in earnings in millions

 



 



 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative policies and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our derivative transactions

 

gains losses on early extinguishment of debt net

 

we repurchased and redeemed portions of several series of senior notes term loans and secured mortgage debt that resulted in the recognition of losses of 68 million and 86 million in 2017 and 2015 respectively and a gain of 2 million in 2016 as a result of these transactions we reduced our effective interest rate and lengthened the maturities of our debt see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our debt repurchases

we recognize income tax expense related to our taxable reit subsidiaries and the local state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income deferred income tax expense benefit is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries operating in the us or in foreign jurisdictions

 

the following table summarizes our income tax expense benefit in millions

 



 

our income taxes are discussed in more detail in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements

 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests

 

this amount represents the thirdparty investors’ share of the earnings generated from consolidated entities in which we do not own 100 of the equity reduced by the thirdparty share of fees or promotes payable to us and earned during the period

see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncontrolling interests

 

other comprehensive income loss 

 

we recorded net gains of 63 million in 2017 and net losses of 136 million and 209 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency translation of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars upon consolidation and translation of our derivative and nonderivative net investment hedges these net gains and losses were primarily due to the strengthening and weakening of the currencies in which we operate to the us dollar 

 

during 2017 we recorded unrealized gains of 23 million and during 2016 and 2015 we recorded unrealized losses of 1 million and 17 million respectively in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income related to the change in fair value of our cash flow hedges and our share of derivatives in our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures

contractual obligations 

 

longterm contractual obligations

 

the following table summarizes our longterm contractual obligations at december 31 2017 in millions

 



 



 

distribution and dividend requirements

 

our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the internal revenue code relative to maintaining our reit status while still allowing us to retain cash to fund capital improvements and other investment activities 

 

under the internal revenue code reits may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income we do not expect the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 to modify our current distribution policy

 

in 2017 we paid quarterly cash dividends of 044 per common share in 2016 we paid quarterly cash dividends of 042 per common share our future common stock dividends if and as declared may vary and will be determined by the board upon the circumstances prevailing at the time including our financial condition operating results and reit distribution requirements and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year

 

we make distributions on the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend the class a units in the op are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to 064665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least 040 per unit we paid a quarterly distribution of 064665 per class a unit in 2017 and 2016

 

at december 31 2017 we had 14 million shares of series q preferred stock outstanding with a liquidation preference of 50 per share the annual dividend rate is 854 per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock

 

other commitments

 

on a continuing basis we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties

 

critical accounting policies

 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity’s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management generally the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance of the accounting policies discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies

 

consolidation

 

we consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100 of the equity but control as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate our ability to control an entity including whether the entity is a variable interest entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary we consider the substantive terms of the arrangement to 

 

identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impa cts the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity investments in entities that we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence ov er operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in the consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets generally at the time the title is transferred consideration is received and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold in many of our transactions an entity in which we have an equity investment will acquire a real estate asset from us we make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the entity that acquires the assets in addition we make judgments regarding recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives earned for services provided to these entities based on when they are earned fixed and determinable

 

acquisitions

 

upon acquisition of real estate that constitutes a business or an asset which includes acquiring a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based on the fair value of each component the components typically include buildings land intangible assets related to the acquired leases debt deferred tax liabilities and other assumed assets and liabilities in an acquisition of multiple properties we allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located the fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties for acquisitions that qualify as a business in the case of an acquisition of a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for under the equity method a stepacquisition under the business combination rules this allocation may result in a gain or a loss the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment which may differ when final information becomes available the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenues and expenses

 

income taxes

 

significant management judgment is required to estimate our income tax liability for each taxable entity the liability associated with open tax years that are under review our reit taxable income and our compliance with reit requirements our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws we estimate our actual current income tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities these estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain nonroutine transactions changes due to audit adjustments by federal international and state tax authorities our inability to qualify as a reit the potential for builtin gain recognition changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to taxable reit subsidiaries and changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within income tax expense we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities

 

recoverability of real estate assets

 

we assess the carrying values of our respective longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable

 

recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models applying a capitalization rate to estimated noi of a property quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals where considered necessary the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to hold is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property assumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows including market rents discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment

 

capitalization of costs 

 

during the land development and construction periods including renovating and rehabilitating we capitalize interest insurance real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use the ability to specifically 

 

identify internal personnel costs associated with development and the determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease requires a high degree of judgment and failure to accurately assess these costs and timing could result in the misstatement of asset values and expenses capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets 

 

new accounting pronouncements

 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

 

funds from operations attributable to common stockholdersunitholders 

 

ffo is a nongaap financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings

 

the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales along with impairment charges of previously depreciated properties we also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties we exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties’ share of our consolidated coinvestment ventures

 

our ffo measures

 

our ffo measures begin with nareit’s definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy while not infrequent or unusual the additional items we adjust for in calculating ffo as modified by prologis and core ffo  both as defined below are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term these items have both positive and negative shortterm effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our longterm outlook

 

we calculate our ffo measures as defined below based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures we reflect our share of our ffo measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our ffo measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods

 

these ffo measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses we do not use our ffo measures as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap as indicators of our operating performance as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs

 

we analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental revenues of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business net of operating administrative and financing expenses this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities

 

ffo as modified by prologis attributable to common stockholders and unitholders “ffo as modified by prologis”

 

to arrive at ffo as modified by prologis  we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax specifically

 



 



 



 



 



 

 

we use ffo as modified by prologis  so that management analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other reits that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the us 

 

core ffo attributable to common stockholders and unitholders “core ffo”

 

in addition to ffo as modified by prologis  we also use core ffo to arrive at core ffo we adjust ffo as modified by prologis  to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly in ffo as modified by prologis 

 



 



 



 



 



 

we use core ffo  including by segment and region to i assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies ii evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods iii evaluate the performance of our management iv budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources v provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance and vi evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results

 

limitations on the use of our ffo measures

 

while we believe our modified ffo measures are important supplemental measures neither nareit’s nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are therefore limited as an analytical tool accordingly these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business some of the limitations are

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

 

we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with n et earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions this information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap to assist investors in compensating for these limitations we reconcile our modified ffo mea sures to our net earnings computed under gaap as follows in millions 

 



 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to the impact of foreign exchangerelated variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments and interest rate changes see our risk factors in item 1a risk factors specifically the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and we may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments see also notes 2 and 16 in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information about our foreign operations and derivative financial instruments

 

we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates at december 31 2017 the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following sections the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value as a result revenues and expenses as well as our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates

 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange variability related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our results of operations or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest generally we borrow in the functional currency of the consolidated subsidiaries but we also borrow in the op and may designate this borrowing as a nonderivative financial instrument we also hedge our foreign currency risk by designating derivative financial instruments as net investment hedges as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments

 

at december 31 2017 after consideration of our nonderivative and derivative financial instruments we had net equity of approximately 10 billion denominated in a currency other than the us dollar representing 56 of total net equity based on our sensitivity analysis a 10 strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies would cause a reduction of 105 million to our net equity

 

at december 31 2017 we had foreign currency forward contracts which were designated and qualify as net investment hedges with an aggregate notional amount of 99 million to hedge a portion of our investments in canada on the basis of our sensitivity analysis a weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar by 10 would result in a 10 million negative change in our cash flows on settlement of these contracts in addition we also have british pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen forward and option contracts which were not designated as hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of 574 million to mitigate risk associated with the translation of the projected earnings of our subsidiaries in canada europe and japan a weakening of the us dollar against these currencies by 10 would result in a 57 million negative change in our net income and cash flows on settlement of these contracts

 

interest rate risk

 

we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows at december 31 2017 we had 23 billion of variable rate debt outstanding of which 19 billion was term loans 317 million was credit facilities and 50 million was secured mortgage debt at december 31 2017 we had interest rate swap agreements to fix 297 million cad 372 million of our canadian term loan on the basis of our sensitivity analysis a 10 adverse change in interest rates based on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances not subject to interest rate swap agreements during the period would result in additional annual interest expense of 2 million which equates to a change in interest rates of 12 basis points

 item 1 business

 

prologis inc is a selfadministered reit and is the sole general partner of prologis lp we operate prologis inc and prologis lp as one enterprise and therefore our discussion and analysis refers to prologis inc and its consolidated subsidiaries including prologis lp collectively

 

prologis inc began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended “internal revenue code” we believe the current organization and method of operation will enable prologis inc to maintain its status as a reit prologis lp also was formed in 1997

 

our corporate headquarters are at pier 1 bay 1 san francisco california 94111 and our other principal offices are located in amsterdam denver luxembourg mexico city shanghai singapore and tokyo

 

our internet address is wwwprologiscom  all reports required to be filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” are available and can be accessed free of charge through the investor relations section of our website wwwprologiscom  the common stock of prologis inc is listed on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the ticker “pld” and is a component of the standard  poor’s “sp” 500

 

the company

 

we are the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on highbarrier highgrowth markets we own manage and develop highquality logistics facilities in the world’s most active centers of commerce an investment in prologis taps into key drivers of economic growth including consumption supply chain modernization ecommerce and urbanization

 

customers turn to us because they know an efficient supply chain will make their businesses run better and that a strategic relationship with prologis will create a competitive advantage we lease modern logistics facilities to a diverse base of approximately 5200 customers these facilities assist the efficient distribution of goods for the world’s best businesses and brands

 

we invest in classa logistics facilities in the world’s primary population centers with high barriers to entry and supported by extensive transportation infrastructure major airports seaports rail systems and highway systems we believe our portfolio is the highestquality logistics property portfolio in the industry because it is focused in those key markets our local teams actively manage the portfolio which encompasses leasing and property management new capital deployment activities and an opportunistic disposition program the majority of our consolidated properties are in the united states or “us” while outside the us our properties are generally held in coinvestment ventures which reduces our exposure to movements in foreign currency therefore we are principally an owneroperator in the us and a managerdeveloper outside the us

 

macroeconomics and demographics are important drivers of our business these drivers include population growth consumption and rising affluence in the developed markets of us europe and japan key factors are the reconfiguration of supply chains strongly influenced by ecommerce trends and the operational efficiencies that can be realized from our modern logistics facilities in emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico new affluence and the rise of the consumer classes have prompted demand as supply chains are constructed taken together logistics real estate markets benefit from economic growth as well as from the modernization of supply chains around the world

 

we manage our business on an owned and managed basis including properties wholly owned by us or owned by one of our coinvestment ventures which allows us to make decisions based on the property operations versus our ownership we believe the operating fundamentals of our owned and managed portfolio are consistent with those of our consolidated port folio and therefore we generally look at operating metrics on an owned and managed basis 

 

at december 31 2016 we owned or had investments in on a wholly owned basis or through coinvestment ventures properties and development projects expected to total 521 billion in gross total investment across 676 million square feet 63 million square meters in 20 countries spanning four continents our investment was 308 billion which consisted of our whollyowned properties and our pro rata or ownership share of the properties owned by our coinvestment ventures

 

throughout this document we reflect amounts in us dollars our reporting currency included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated into us dollars we mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by investing outside the us through coinvestment ventures borrowing in local currency and utilizing derivative instruments

 

 

details of the 676 million square feet at december 31 2016 in our owned and managed portfolio were as follows dollars and square feet in millions

 



 



 

our operating portfolio includes stabilized logistics facilities in our owned and managed portfolio a developed property moves into the operating portfolio when it meets stabilization the property is considered stabilized when a development project has been completed for one year or is at least 90 occupied whichever occurs first 

 

business strategy and operating segments

 

our business comprises two operating segments real estate operations and strategic capital

rental operations rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and contributed approximately 90 of our consolidated revenues earnings and funds from operations in 2016 see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on funds from operations a nongaap measure we collect rent from our customers through operating leases including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs we expect to generate longterm internal growth by maintaining high occupancy rates increasing rents and controlling expenses we believe our active portfolio management coupled with the skills of our property leasing maintenance capital energy and risk management teams will allow us to maximize rental revenues across our portfolio in 2016 over 90 of our consolidated revenues and noi in this segment were generated in the us noi from this segment is calculated directly from our financial statements as rental revenues rental recoveries and development management and other revenues less rental expenses and other expenses 

 

development we utilize i our land bank ii the development expertise of our local teams iii our customer relationships and iv our indepth local knowledge in connection with our development activities successful development and redevelopment efforts increase both the rental revenues and the net asset value of our real estate operations segment we measure the value we created based on the increase in estimated fair value of a stabilized development property as compared to the costs incurred generally we develop properties in the us for longterm hold and outside the us for contribution to our coinvestment ventures occasionally we develop for sale to third parties 

 

strategic capital 

 

real estate is a capitalintensive business that requires growth capital our strategic capital business gives us access to thirdparty capital both private and public which allows us to diversify our sources of capital and therefore have a broader range of options to fund our growth we coinvest with some of the world’s largest institutional partners to grow our business and provide incremental revenues we also access alternative sources of equity through two publicly traded vehicles nippon prologis reit inc “npr” in japan and fibra prologis in mexico we tailor logistics portfolios to meet our partners’ specific needs with a focus on longterm ventures and openended funds we hold significant ownership interests in these ventures aligning our interests with those of our partners 

 

we generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated ventures principally through asset management and property management services and we earn additional revenues by providing leasing acquisition construction development financing and disposition services depending on the structure of the venture and the returns provided to our partners we also earn revenues through incentive fees “promotes” periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation in 2016 we earned promote revenues in europe of 89 million approximately 40 of promote revenues are paid as a combination of cash and stock awards pursuant to the terms of the prologis promote plan and expensed through strategic capital expenses this segment contributed approximately 10 of our consolidated revenues earnings and funds from operations in 2016 we plan to grow this business through increasing the assets under management in our existing ventures in 2016 approximately 90 of the consolidated revenues and noi in this segment were generated outside the us noi in this segment is calculated as strategic capital revenues less strategic capital expenses directly from each line item in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and does not include property related noi

 

competition 

 

competitively priced logistics space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge which in turn could affect both of our operating segments we may face competition with regard to our capital deployment activities including local regional and national operators or developers we also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business

 

we believe we have competitive advantages due to our

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

customers

 

our broad customer base represents a spectrum of international national regional and local logistics users at december 31 2016 in our real estate operations segment representing our consolidated properties we had more than 3200 customers occupying 334 million square feet of logistics space on an owned and managed basis we had more than 5200 customers occupying 625 million square feet of logistics space

employees 

 

the following table summarizes our employee base at december 31 2016 

 



 



 

we allocate our employees who perform property management functions to our real estate operations segment and strategic capital segment based on the size of the respective portfolios employees who perform only strategic capital functions are allocated directly to that segment

 

we believe we have good relationships with our employees prologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements although some employees in europe are represented by statutory works councils and as such benefit from applicable labor agreements

 

code of ethics and business conduct

 

we maintain a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to our board of directors the “board” and all of our officers and employees including the principal executive officer the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer and other people performing similar functions a copy of our code of ethics and business conduct is available on our website wwwprologiscom  in addition to being accessible through our website copies of our code of ethics and business conduct can be obtai ned free of charge upon written request to investor relations pier 1 bay 1 san francisco california 94111 any amendments to or waivers of our code of ethics and business conduct that apply to the principal executive officer the principal financial officer the principal accounting officer or other people performing similar functions and that relate to any matter enumerated in item 406b of regulation sk will be disclosed on our website 

 

e nvironmental matters 

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired including land while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see further discussion in item 1a risk factors and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

 

insurance coverage

 

we carry insurance coverage on our properties we determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance selfinsurance and a whollyowned captive insurance entity the costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through reimbursements from our customers we believe that our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured see further discussion in item 1a risk factors

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition including but not limited to our financial position results of operations cash flow ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market value of our securities these risks relate to our consolidated company as well as our investments in unconsolidated entities and include among others i general risks ii risks related to our business iii risks related to financing and capital and iv income tax risks

 

general risks 

 

as a global company we are subject to social political and economic risks of doing business in many countries

 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the us during 2016 we generated approximately 453 million or 179 of our revenues from operations outside the us circumstances and developments related to international and us operations that could negatively affect us include but are not limited to the following factors

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

in addition we may be impacted by the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt due to currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other factors

 

disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition

 

to the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect i the value of our properties ii the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing iii our ability to make principal and interest payments on or refinance any outstanding debt when due and iv the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities

 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks

 

despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks such as computer viruses or unauthorized access any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business we may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws unauthorized access to information of ours and others significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business

 

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel

 

we depend on the deep industry knowledge and the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees from time to time our personnel and their roles may change while we believe that we are able to retain our key talent and find suitable employees to meet our personnel needs the loss of key personnel any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our business if we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected

 

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting

 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements or a decline in the price of our securities

 

the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position

 

we pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the functional currency at december 31 2016 approximately 66 billion or 220 of our total consolidated assets are invested in a currency other than the us dollar primarily the british pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen as a result we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our business and in particular our us dollar reported financial position and results of operations and debt covenant ratios although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and using derivative contracts there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful 

 

our hedging of foreign currency and interest rate risk may not effectively limit our exposure to other risks

 

hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency or interest rates and the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements the funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of the hedged foreign currency or the size of the underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of the breakage the failure to hedge effectively against foreign exchange changes or interest rate changes may adversely affect our business 

 

compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs

 

we are required to comply with many regulations in different countries including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar laws and regulations our properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as the americans with disabilities act and state and local fire and lifesafety requirements noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants while we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us if we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with these regulations we may be adversely affected

 

risks related to our business 

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets which may reduce economic returns to investors

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as secured mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments as a reit under the internal revenue code we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable reit subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment to generate liquidity if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale we may not pursue such sales

 

we may decide to sell properties to certain of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures or third parties to generate proceeds to fund our capital deployment activities our ability to sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by i competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties ii market conditions including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties and iii other factors beyond our control if our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or at all the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital in the private and public markets in order to acquire properties from us should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then dispositions could be delayed 

 

if we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations sales or contributions of properties or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation divesting ourselves of properties whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term at less than optimal terms incurring debt entering into leases with new customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates there can be no assurance however that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us additionally taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our business and in particular our distributable cash flow and debt covenants

 

our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector

 

our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the logistics sector this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified

 

general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results

 

we are exposed to general economic conditions local regional national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties

 

at december 31 2016 approximately 330 of our consolidated operating properties or 80 billion based on consolidated gross book value or investment before depreciation are located in california which represented 263 of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 337 of our noi our revenues from and the value of our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for logistics properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california’s economic climate because of the number of properties we have located in california a downturn in california’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to california we also have significant holdings defined as more than 30 of total consolidated investment before depreciation in operating properties in certain markets located in central and eastern pennsylvania chicago dallasfort worth new jerseynew york city seattle and south florida our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties conditions such as an oversupply of logistics space or a reduction in demand for logistics space among other factors may impact operating conditions any material oversupply of logistics space or material reduction in demand for logistics space could adversely affect our overall business 

 

in addition our owned and managed portfolio including the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures in which we invest has concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above as well as in markets in france germany japan and the uk and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets

 

a number of our investments both whollyowned and owned through coinvestment ventures are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity us properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the san francisco bay area los angeles and seattle international properties located in active seismic areas include japan and mexico we generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to selfinsure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis we have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for our assets in japan based on this analysis

 

furthermore a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane or flood risk we carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants 

 

investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business

 

investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio market research and our asset management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated factors that may affect real estate values and cash flows include

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or release space on favorable terms as leases expire

 

our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations we are also subject to the risk that upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties leases may not be renewed by existing customers the space may not be released to new customers or the terms of renewal or releasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers we may lose potential customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when our customers’ leases expire in the event of default by a significant number of customers we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord and we may be unable to release spaces a customer may experience a downturn in its business which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease in addition a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow

 

we may acquire properties which involves risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

 

we have acquired properties and will continue to acquire properties both through the direct acquisition of real estate and through the acquisition of entities that own the real estate and through additional investments in coinvestment ventures that acquire properties the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates when we acquire properties we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures additionally there is and it is expected there will continue to be significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities the acquired properties or entities may be subject to liabilities which may be without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based on ownership of any of these entities or properties then we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it 

 

our real estate development strategies may not be successful

 

our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through development of logistics facilities to hold for longterm investment contribution or sale to a coinvestment venture or third party depending on market conditions our liquidity needs and other factors we may increase our investment in the development renovation and redevelopment business and we expect to complete the buildout and leasing of our current development portfolio we may also develop renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed coinvestment ventures the real estate development renovation and redevelopment business includes the following significant risks

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming coinvestment ventures investing in new or existing coinvestment ventures attracting thirdparty investment and investing in and managing properties through coinvestment ventures

 

at december 31 2016 we had investments in real estate containing approximately 403 million square feet held through coinvestment ventures both public and private our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in these ventures and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through coinvestment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances however there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new coinvestment ventures or attract thirdparty investment or that additional investments in new or existing ventures to develop or acquire properties will be successful further there can be no assurance that we are able to realize value from such investments 

 

our coinvestment ventures involve certain additional risks that we do not otherwise face including

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our coinvestment ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives however we may not be able to continue to do so indefinitely we have formed publicly traded investment vehicles such as npr and fibra prologis for which we serve as sponsor or manager we have contributed and may continue to contribute assets into such vehicles there is a risk that our managerial relationship may be terminated 

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks including the potential impacts of future climate change which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition

 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator 

knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs includi ng investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination 

 

environmental laws in some countries including the us also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of our properties are known to contain asbestoscontaining building materials

 

in addition some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances furthermore certain of our properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in connection with certain divested properties we have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties

 

we are also exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate our logistics facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events such as severe storms or floods if the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change our exposure to these events could increase we do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change as our operations generally do not emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases however we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain or stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the presence of such substances on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and this may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition and in particular our distributable cash flow

 

our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses 

 

we and our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy namely windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets we believe our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures are adequately insured certain losses however including losses from floods earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots generally are not insured against or generally are not fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property

 

furthermore we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties and if there is recourse debt then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our business 

 

risks related to financing and capital 

 

we may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments

 

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and if the maturing debt is secured the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness our credit facilities and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements

 

covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition

 

the terms of our various credit agreements including our credit facilities the indentures under which our senior notes are issued and other note agreements require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants such as maintaining debt service 

coverage leverage ratios fixed charge ratios and other ope rating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness if we default un der the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations our business and financial condition generally and in particular the amount of our distributable cash flow could be adversely affected  

 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity

 

the credit ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing also a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our credit facilities and other debt instruments adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and in particular our refinancing and other capital market activities our ability to manage debt maturities our future growth and our development and acquisition activity

 

at december 31 2016 our credit ratings were a3 from moody’s and a from sp both with stable outlook a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization

 

we depend on external sources of capital

 

to qualify as a reit we are required each year to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders and we may be subject to tax to the extent our taxable income is not fully distributed historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders but we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances our own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years that ended on or before december 31 2016 and in some cases declared as late as december 31 2016 a reit can satisfy up to 90 of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital furthermore to maintain our reit status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all depends on a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities

 

our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock or units in the operating partnership

 

any additional future issuance of common stock or operating partnership units will reduce the percentage of our common stock and units owned by investors in most circumstances stockholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock or units in addition depending on the terms and pricing of any additional offering of our common stock or units and the value of the properties our stockholders and unitholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock or units

 

income tax risks 

 

the failure of prologis inc to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences

 

prologis inc elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code commencing with the taxable year ended december 31 1997 we believe we have operated prologis inc to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable prologis inc to continue to qualify as a reit however it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow prologis inc to qualify as a reit or that our future operations could cause prologis inc to fail to qualify qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some annually and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex sections of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control for example to qualify as a reit prologis inc must derive at least 95 of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition prologis inc must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis the provisions of the internal revenue code and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a reit are more complicated for prologis inc because we hold assets through the operating partnership

 

if prologis inc fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on taxable income at regular corporate rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions prologis inc would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it lost the qualification if prologis inc lost its reit status our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved

 

furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits that elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit gross income tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to us federal income tax in addition a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect on the ability of prologis inc to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus its ability to qualify as a reit

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction

 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties including by contributing properties to our coinvestment ventures under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions while we believe that the internal revenue service would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

 

legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us

management’s overview

 

we believe the quality and scale of our global operating portfolio the expertise of our team and the strength of our balance sheet give us unique competitive advantages our plan to grow revenues earnings noi cash flows and funds from operations is based on the following

 





 



 



 

summary of 2016

 

during the year ended december 31 2016 operating fundamentals remained strong for our owned and managed portfolio and we ended the year with occupancy of 971 see below for details of the operating and development activity of our owned and managed portfolio during 2016 we completed the following activities as further described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements

 



 



 



 



 



 

in january 2017 we sold our investment in elv to our fund partner and elv contributed its properties to ptelf in exchange for equity interests

 

results of operations 

 

we evaluate our business operations based on the noi of our two business reporting segments real estate operations and strategic capital noi by segment is a nongaap financial measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements we consider noi by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps both management and investors to understand the core operations of our business 

 

below is a reconciliation of our noi by segment to operating income per the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 in millions each segment’s noi is reconciled to a line item in the consolidated financial statements in the respective segment discussion below

 



see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our segments and a reconciliation of each reportable business segment’s noi to operating income and earnings before income taxes 

 

real estate operations

 

this operating segment principally includes rental revenues rental recoveries and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties we allocate the costs of our property management functions to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses and the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses based on the size of the relative portfolios as compared to our total owned and managed portfolio the operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to improve which has positively affected both the rental rates and occupancy and also has fueled development activity 

 

below are the components of real estate operations revenues expenses and noi for the years ended december 31 in millions derived directly from line items in the consolidated financial statements

 



 

real estate operations revenues expenses and noi are impacted by capital deployment activities occupancy and changes in rental rates the following items highlight the key changes in noi for the years ended december 31 in millions

 



 



 

the impact from acquisitions in 2015 from 2014 included the ktr transaction in 2015 and the consolidation of naif in 2014 ktr included an additional 176 million of net revenues which was slightly offset by 25 million in acquisition costs 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we consolidated our coinvestment venture naif which increased noi 153 million in 2015 from 2014

 

approximately 45 and 34 of ktr and naif activity respectively is offset in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests attributable to our venture partner’s share see note 3 in the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the ktr transaction and naif consolidation

 



 



 



 

below are key operating metrics of our consolidated operating portfolio for the years ended december 31

 

  

 

strategic capital

 

this operating segment includes revenues from asset management and other fees as well as promotes earned for services performed for our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures revenues associated with the strategic capital segment fluctuate because of the size of coinvestment ventures under management the transactional activity in the ventures and the timing of promotes these revenues are reduced generally by the direct costs associated with the asset management and propertylevel management for the properties owned by these ventures we allocate the costs of our property management functions to the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses and to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses based on the size of the relative portfolios as compared to our total owned and managed portfolio

 

below are the components of strategic capital revenues expenses and noi for the years ended december 31 derived directly from the line items in the consolidated financial statements in millions 

 



 

below is additional detail of our strategic capital revenues expenses and noi for the years ended december 31 in millions

 



 



 



 



 



 

the following real estate investments were held through our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures at december 31 dollars and square feet in millions

 



 

see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures

 

ga expenses

 

ga expenses increased 5 million for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the same time period in 2015 primarily due to increased compensation including equitybased compensation awards ga expenses decreased 12 million for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the same time period in 2014 primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen

 

we capitalize certain costs directly related to our development and leasing activities capitalized ga expenses included salaries and related costs as well as other ga costs the following table summarizes capitalized ga amounts for the years ended december 31 in millions 

 



 

depreciation and amortization expenses

 

the following table highlights the key changes in depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended december 31 in millions 

 



 



 

our owned and managed properties

 

we manage our business on an owned and managed basis which includes properties wholly owned by us or owned by one of our coinvestment ventures we review our operating fundamentals on an owned and managed basis we believe reviewing these fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact to the financial statements as it will affect both the real estate operations and strategic capital segments as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures based on our ownership share we do not control the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures for purposes of gaap and the presentation of the ventures’ operating information does not represent a legal claim to such items 

 

our owned and managed portfolio includes operating properties and does not include properties under development or held for sale to third parties and was as follows at december 31 square feet in millions

 



 

operating activity

 

below is information summarizing the leasing activity of our owned and managed operating portfolio for the years ended december 31

development start activity

for information on our development portfolio at december 31 2016 see item 2 properties

 

same store analysis

 

we evaluate the operating performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures we include properties from our owned and managed portfolio in our same store analysis we have defined the same store portfolio for the three months ended december 31 2016 as those properties that were in operation at january 1 2015 and have been in operation throughout the same threemonth periods in both 2016 and 2015 including development properties that have been completed and available for lease we have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party or were classified as held for sale to a third party from the population for both periods we believe the factors that affect rental revenues rental expenses and noi in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total operating portfolio to derive an appropriate 

measure of periodtoperiod operating performance we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the recent period end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the us dollar for both periods 

 

same store is a commonly used measure in the real estate industry our same store measures are nongaap financial measures that are calculated beginning with rental revenues rental recoveries and rental expenses from the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap as our same store measures are nongaap financial measures they have certain limitations as analytical tools and may vary among real estate companies as a result we provide a reconciliation from our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap to same store property noi with explanations of how these metrics are calculated

 

the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues rental recoveries rental expenses and property noi for the full year as included in the consolidated statements of income and within note 20 to the consolidated financial statements to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended december 31 dollars in millions

 



 



 





 



 



 

other components of income expense

 

earnings from unconsolidated entities net

 

we recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities that are accounted for using the equity method of 206 million 159 million and 134 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the earnings we recognize can be impacted by i variances in revenues and expenses of each venture ii the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture iii gains or losses from the dispositions of properties iv our ownership interest in each venture and v fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to us dollars

 

see the discussion of our coinvestment ventures above in the strategic capital segment discussion and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized

 

interest expense

 

the following table details our net interest expense for the year ended december 31 dollars in millions

 



 

gross interest expense decreased in 2016 compared with 2015 principally from lower outstanding debt balances and borrowing costs during the periods our debt decreased by 10 billion from december 31 2015 to december 31 2016 primarily from the repayment of the senior term loan related to the ktr transaction with proceeds from contributions and dispositions gross interest expense increased in 2015 compared with 2014 due to higher debt driven by the ktr transaction offset somewhat by a decrease in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of gross interest expense amortization and capitalized amounts included in net interest expense see also the liquidity and capital resources section for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs

 

gains on dispositions of investments in real estate and revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest net 

 

over the last three years we have contributed properties generally that we had developed to our coinvestment ventures in europe japan and mexico as included in the table below we recognize a gain to the extent of the third party ownership in the venture acquiring the property in 2014 our contribution activity included the properties that we contributed to fibra prologis upon its formation 

 

in addition we have sold properties to third parties generally from our operating portfolio in the us these dispositions have supported our strategic objective of owning a portfolio of highquality properties in the most active centers of commerce 

 

we utilize the proceeds from both contributions and dispositions to fund our capital investments 

 

the following table details our gains on dispositions of investments in real estate and revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest net for the year ended december 31 in millions

 



 



 

see notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the gains we recognized

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative policies and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our derivative transactions

 

gains losses on early extinguishment of debt net

 

we repurchased portions of several series of senior notes senior exchangeable notes and secured mortgage debt that resulted in the recognition of a gain of 2 million in 2016 and losses of 86 million and 165 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively as a result of these transactions we reduced our effective interest rate and lengthened the maturities of our debt see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our debt repurchases

 

income tax expense benefit

 

we recognize current income tax expense for income taxes incurred by our taxable reit subsidiaries state and local income taxes and taxes incurred in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income deferred income tax expense benefit is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries operating in the us or in foreign jurisdictions

 

the following table summarizes our income tax expense benefit for the year ended december 31 in millions 

 



 

our income taxes are discussed in more detail in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements

 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests

 

this amount represents the thirdparty investors’ share of the earnings generated in consolidated entities in which we do not own 100 of the equity reduced by the third party share of fees or promotes payable to us and earned during the period

 

the following table summarizes net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 in millions

 



 



 



 

see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our consolidated coinvestment ventures

 

other comprehensive loss 

 

during 2016 2015 and 2014 we recorded net losses in our statement of comprehensive income related to foreign currency translations of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars upon consolidation these losses were principally due to the weakening of the brazilian real british pound sterling euro and japanese yen to the us dollar 

 

during 2016 2015 and 2014 we also recorded unrealized losses in our statement of comprehensive income related to the change in fair value of our cash flow hedges and our share of derivatives in our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures

 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative policies and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our derivative transactions and other comprehensive losses

 

other matters

 

on june 23 2016 the uk passed a referendum to leave the european union our key business driver remains intact and we have not seen nor do we anticipate a material operational or financial impact our customers in the uk principally serve domestic consumers and we do not expect the decision to leave the european union will materially change the consumption habits that drive our business at december 31 2016 our owned and managed uk operating portfolio was 995 leased and had a weighted average lease term of nine years with only 46 of the leases expiring in 2017 the uk portfolio contributes approximately 4 of our share of annual noi through consolidated entities and coinvestment ventures

 

environmental matters

 

a majority of the properties we acquired were subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments have revealed an 

environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see note 17 in the consolidated financial statem ents for further information about environmental liabilities 

 

liquidity and capital resources

 

overview

 

we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities distributions from our coinvestment ventures dispositions of properties and from available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development acquisition operating debt service dividend and distribution requirements

 

nearterm principal cash sources and uses

 

in addition to dividends to the common and preferred stockholders of prologis and distributions to the holders of limited partnership units of the operating partnership and our partners in the consolidated coinvestment ventures we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following

at december 31 2016 we did not guarantee any thirdparty debt of the coinvestment ventures in our role as the manager or sponsor we work with the coinvestment ventures to refinance their maturing debt there can be no assurance that the coinvestment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt or at all if the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets certain of our ventures also have credit facilities or unencumbered properties both of which may be used to obtain funds

 

contractual obligations 

 

longterm contractual obligations

 

the following table summarizes our longterm contractual obligations at december 31 2016 in millions

 



 



 

distribution and dividend requirements

 

our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the internal revenue code relative to maintaining our reit status while still allowing us to retain cash to meet other needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities

 

in 2016 we paid quarterly cash dividends of 042 per common share in 2015 we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 036 for the first two quarters and 040 per common share for the last two quarters our future common stock dividends if and as declared may vary and will be determined by the board upon the circumstances prevailing at the time including our financial condition operating results and reit distribution requirements and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year

 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we issued a new class of common limited partnership units in the operating partnership that are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to 064665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least 040 per unit see note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for more information on this new partnership unit class we paid a distribution of 064665 in december 2016 and in december 2015 related to this new partnership unit class we make distributions to the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend

 

at december 31 2016 we had 16 million shares of one series of preferred stock outstanding – the “series q preferred stock” with a liquidation preference of 50 per share the annual dividend rate is 854 per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock

 

other commitments

 

on a continuing basis we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties

 

critical accounting policies

 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity’s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management generally the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance of the accounting policies discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies

 

consolidation

 

we consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100 of the equity but control as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate our ability to control an entity including whether the entity is a variable interest entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary we consider the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity investments in entities that we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted 

for using the equity method our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in the consolidated financ ial statements   

 

business combinations

 

upon acquisition of real estate that constitutes a business which includes acquiring a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based on the fair value of each component the components typically include buildings land intangible assets related to the acquired leases debt deferred tax liabilities and other assumed assets and liabilities in an acquisition of multiple properties we allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located the fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties in the case of an acquisition of a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting this allocation may result in a gain or a loss the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment which may differ when final information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period not to exceed one year the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenues and expenses

 

revenue recognition – gains losses on dispositions of investments in real estate and strategic capital revenues

 

we recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets generally at the time the title is transferred consideration is received and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold in many of our transactions an entity in which we have an equity investment will acquire a real estate asset from us we make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the entity that acquires the assets in addition we make judgments regarding recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives earned for services provided to these entities based on when they are earned fixed and determinable

 

derivative financial instruments

 

derivative financial instruments can be designated as fair value hedges cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that at inception and over the term of the instruments the hedged item and derivative qualify for hedge accounting the rules and interpretations for derivatives are complex failure to apply this guidance correctly may result in all changes in fair value of the hedged derivative being recognized in earnings we assess both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures any ineffective portion of a derivative financial instruments change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings derivatives not designated as hedges are used to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and variable interest rates but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements the rules and interpretations for derivatives are complex failure to apply this guidance correctly may result in all changes in fair value of the hedged derivative being recognized in earnings see notes 2 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our derivative financial instrument policy and our derivative financial instruments

 

income taxes

 

significant management judgment is required to estimate our income tax liability for each taxable entity the liability associated with open tax years that are under review our reit taxable income and our compliance with reit requirements our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws we estimate our actual current income tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities these estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain nonroutine transactions changes due to audit adjustments by federal international and state tax authorities our inability to qualify as a reit the potential for builtin gain recognition changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to taxable reit subsidiaries and changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within income tax expense we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities

 

recoverability of real estate assets

 

we assess the carrying values of our respective longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable

 

recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models applying a capitalization rate to estimated noi of a property quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals where considered necessary the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the 

stra tegic plan we use to manage our underlying business if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to hold is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property assumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows including market rents discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective chang es in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairmen t 

 

capitalization of costs 

 

during the land development and construction periods including renovating and rehabilitating we capitalize interest insurance real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use the ability to specifically identify internal personnel costs associated with development and the determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease requires a high degree of judgment and failure to accurately assess these costs and timing could result in the misstatement of asset values and expenses capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets

 

new accounting pronouncements

 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

 

funds from operations attributable to common stockholdersunitholders “ffo”

 

ffo is a nongaap financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings

 

the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales along with impairment charges of previously depreciated properties we also consider the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment to be similar as a gain from the sale of previously depreciated properties under the nareit definition of ffo we exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties’ share of our consolidated ventures

 

our ffo measures

 

our ffo measures begin with nareit’s definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy while not infrequent or unusual the additional items we adjust for in calculating ffo as modified by prologis and core ffo  both as defined below are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term these items have both positive and negative shortterm effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our longterm outlook

 

we calculate our ffo measures based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures we reflect our share of our ffo measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our ffo measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods

 

these ffo measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses we do not use our ffo measures as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap as indicators of our operating performance as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs

 

we analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental revenues of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business net of operating administrative and financing expenses this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities

 

ffo as modified by prologis attributable to common stockholders and unitholders “ffo as modified by prologis”

 

to arrive at ffo as modified by prologis  we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude

 



 



 



 



 



 

we use ffo as modified by prologis  so that management analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other reits that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the us

 

core ffo attributable to common stockholders and unitholders “core ffo”

 

in addition to ffo as modified by prologis  we also use core ffo to arrive at core ffo we adjust ffo as modified by prologis  to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly in ffo as modified by prologis 

 



 



 



 



 



 

we use core ffo  including by segment and region to i assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general ii evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions iii evaluate the performance of our management iv budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources v provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance and v evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results

 

limitations on the use of our ffo measures

 

while we believe our modified ffo measures are important supplemental measures neither nareit’s nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are therefore limited as an analytical tool accordingly these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business some of these limitations are

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions this information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap to assist investors in compensating for these limitations we reconcile our modified ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap for years ended december 31 as follows in millions

 



 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to the impact of foreign exchangerelated variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments and interest rate changes see our risk factors in item 1a risk factors specifically the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and we may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments see also notes 2 and 16 in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for more information about our foreign operations and derivative financial instruments

 

we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in exchange or interest rates at december 31 2016 the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following sections the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value as a result revenues and expenses as well as our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates

 

foreign currency risk

 

we are exposed to foreign exchangerelated variability of investments and earnings from our foreign investments foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our financial results or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2016 after consideration of our derivative and nonderivative financial instruments we had net equity of approximately 16 billion denominated in a currency other than the us dollar representing 79 of total net equity based on our sensitivity analysis a 10 reduction in exchange rates would cause a reduction of 161 million to our net equity

 

at december 31 2016 we had foreign currency forward contracts which were designated and qualify as net investment hedges with an aggregate notional amount of 146 million to hedge a portion of our investments in canada and the uk on the basis of our sensitivity analysis a weakening of the us dollar against the british pound sterling or canadian dollar by 10 would result in a 15 million negative change in our cash flows on settlement in addition we also have british pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen forward and option contracts which were not designated as hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of 457 million to mitigate risk associated with the translation of the projected earnings of our subsidiaries in canada europe and japan a 

weakening of the us dollar against these currenc ies by 10 would result in a 46 million negative change in our net income and cash flows on settlement 

 

interest rate risk

 

we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows at december 31 2016 we had 18 billion of variable rate debt outstanding of which 15 billion was outstanding on our term loans 279 million was outstanding on secured mortgage debt and 35 million was outstanding on our credit facilities at december 31 2016 we had interest rate swap agreements to fix 276 million cad 372 million of our canadian term loan during the year ended december 31 2016 we had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of 126 million on our variable rate credit facilities on the basis of our sensitivity analysis a 10 adverse change in interest rates based on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances not subject to interest rate swap agreements during the period would result in additional annual interest expense of 2 million which equates to a change in interest rates of 11 basis points

investment strategy

 

our investment strategy focuses on providing highquality distribution facilities to customers whose businesses are tied to consumption and global trade and as such depend on the efficient movement of goods through the supply chain we have a significant worldwide presence of 515 billion of real estate assets in our owned and managed portfolio which spans 20 countries on four continents we focus our investments in large population centers with high percapita consumption rates located near major airports seaports and rail and highway systems we classify our properties into two main market categories global and regional global markets comprise approximately 30 of the largest markets tied to global trade and consumption regional markets benefit from large population centers but typically are not as tied to the global supply chain instead they serve local consumption and are less supply constrained 

 

we intend to hold primarily classa product in global and regional markets at december 31 2015 global and regional markets represented approximately 89 and 11 respectively of our owned and managed portfolio based on our share as determined by our ownership percentage for consolidated and unconsolidated entities of the properties’ gross book value

 

we have deep knowledge of our local markets extensive construction expertise and a demonstrated commitment to sustainable design across our portfolio we are supported by a diverse customer base and our relationships with multinational corporations bring us repeat business across our global portfolio see below for information on our customers for more detail on our properties see item 2 properties

 

both macroeconomics and demographics are important drivers of our business these drivers include population growth consumption and rising affluence in the developed markets of the united states or “us” europe and japan the reconfiguration of supply chains which is strongly influenced by ecommerce trends as well as the operational efficiencies that can be realized from our modern logistics facilities are key factors in emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico new affluence and the rise of the consumer classes together have prompted demand as supply chains are constructed taken together logistics real estate markets benefit from economic growth as well as from the modernization of supply chains around the world

 

in addition to our wholly owned investments we also have investments in a variety of ventures we coinvest with partners and investors in entities that own multiple properties we refer to these entities as coinvestment ventures consolidated or unconsolidated

 

business strategy and operating segments

 

our business comprises two operating segments real estate operations and strategic capital

 

real estate operations 

 

rental operations rental operations is the largest segment and contributed approximately 90 of our revenues earnings and funds from operations in 2015 see below for our definition of funds from operations and a complete reconciliation to net earnings in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we collect rent from our customers through operating leases including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs we expect to generate longterm internal growth by maintaining high occupancy rates controlling expenses and increasing rents our rental revenue is diversified by customer segment and geography we believe our property management leasing and maintenance teams together with our capital expenditure energy and risk management programs create cost efficiencies that allow us to capitalize on the economies of scale inherent in owning operating and growing a global portfolio 

 

capital deployment  capital deployment includes the development redevelopment and acquisition of industrial properties to increase rental income and therefore is reported with rental operations we primarily deploy capital in global and regional markets to serve our customers’ requirements we capitalize on the following i our land bank ii the development expertise of our local teams iii our customer relationships and iv the demand for highquality distribution facilities we aim to increase our rental revenue and our net asset value by leasing newly developed space and acquiring operating properties we develop properties for longterm hold for contribution to our coinvestment ventures and occasionally for sale to third parties in 2015 we stabilized 16 billion of development projects with an estimated gross margin of 32 creating 515 million in value for prologis 

 

strategic capital 

 

real estate is a capital intensive business that requires growth capital we manage thirdparty capital on behalf of the world’s largest institutional partners in order to grow our business provide incremental revenues and align our assets and liabilities in local currencies thereby mitigating foreign currency risk associated with our international investments we tailor logistics portfolios to meet our partners’ specific needs with a focus on longterm ventures and openended funds we also access alternative sources of equity through the publicly traded vehicles nippon prologis reit inc “npr” and fibra prologis we hold a significant ownership interest in these ventures aligning our interests with those of our partners we generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated ventures through asset management and property management services and we earn additional revenues by providing leasing acquisition construction development financing and disposition services at december 31 2015 we managed 2765 million square feet of operating properties in nine unconsolidated coinvestment ventures for more detail of our coinvestment ventures see item 2 properties depending on the structure of the venture and the returns provided to our partners we also earn revenues through incentive fees during the life of a venture or upon liquidation called “promotes” in 2015 this segment contributed approximately 10 of our revenues earnings and our funds from operations we plan to grow this business generally through our existing ventures

 

competition

 

competitively priced distribution space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge which in turn could affect both of our operating segments we may face competition with regard to our capital deployment activities including local regional and national operators or developers we also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business

 

we believe we have competitive advantages due to our

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

customers

 

our broad customer base represents a spectrum of international national regional and local distribution users at december 31 2015 in real estate operations we had more than 4600 customers occupying 3383 million square feet of distribution space on an owned and managed basis we had more than 5200 customers occupying 6147 million square feet of distribution space 

 

in strategic capital we view our partners and investors as our customers at december 31 2015 in our private ventures we partnered with approximately 100 investors several of which invest in multiple ventures

 

the following table details our top 25 customers at december 31 2015 square feet in thousands

 



 



 

employees 

 

the following table summarizes our global employee base at december 31 2015

 



 

we believe we have good relationships with our employees prologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements although some employees in europe are represented by statutory works councils and as such they benefit from applicable labor agreements

 

code of ethics and business conduct

 

we maintain a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to our board of directors the “board” and all of our officers and employees including the principal executive officer the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer or other people performing similar functions a copy of our code of ethics and business conduct is available on our website wwwprologiscom  in addition to being accessible through our website copies of our code of ethics and business conduct can be obtained free of charge upon written request to investor relations pier 1 bay 1 san francisco california 94111 any amendments to or waivers of our code of ethics and business conduct that apply to the principal executive officer the principal financial officer or the principal accounting officer or other people performing similar functions and that relate to any matter enumerated in item 406b of regulation sk will be disclosed on our website 

 

environmental matters

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired including land while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see item 1a risk factors and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

 

insura nce coverage 

 

we carry insurance coverage on our properties we determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance selfinsurance and a whollyowned captive insurance entity the costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through reimbursements from our customers we believe that our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured see further discussion in item 1a risk factors

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition including but not limited to our financial position results of operations cash flow ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market value of our securities these risks relate to our consolidated company as well as our investments in unconsolidated entities and include among others i general risks ii risks related to our business iii risks related to financing and capital and iv income tax risks

 

general risks 

 

as a global company we are subject to social political and economic risks of doing business in many countries

 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the us during 2015 we generated approximately 3353 million or 153 of our revenue from operations outside the us circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect us include but are not limited to the following factors

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

in addition we may be impacted by the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt due to currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other factors

 

disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition

 

to the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect i the value of our properties ii the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing iii our ability to make principal and interest payments on or refinance any outstanding debt when due and iv the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities

 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks

 

despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks such as computer viruses or unauthorized access any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business we may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws unauthorized access to information of ours and others significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business

 

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel

 

we depend on the deep industry knowledge and the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees from time to time our personnel and their roles may change while we believe that we are able to retain our key talent and find suitable employees to meet our personnel needs the loss of key personnel any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our business if we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected

 

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting

 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements or a decline in the price of our securities

 

the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position

 

we pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the functional currency at december 31 2015 approximately 63 billion or 201 of our total assets are invested in a currency other than the us dollar primarily the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen as a result we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our business and in particular our us dollar reported financial position and results of operations and debt covenant ratios although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and using derivative contracts there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful 

 

our hedging of foreign currency and interest rate risk may not effectively limit our exposure to other risks

 

hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency or interest rates and the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements the funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of the hedged foreign currency or the size of the underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of the breakage the failure to hedge effectively against exchange rate changes or interest rate changes may adversely affect our business 

 

compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs

 

we are required to comply with many regulations in different countries including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws and regulations our properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as the americans with disabilities act and state and local fire and lifesafety requirements noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants while we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us if we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with these regulations we may be adversely affected

 

risks related to our business 

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets which may reduce economic returns to investors

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as secured mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments as a reit under the internal revenue code we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable reit subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment to generate liquidity if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale we may not pursue such sales

 

we may decide to sell properties to certain of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures or third parties to generate proceeds to fund our capital deployment activities our ability to sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by i competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties ii market conditions including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties and i ii other factors beyond our control if our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or at all  the unconsolidated coinvestment venture or third party who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital in the private and public markets in order to acquire properties from us should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then dispositions could be delayed 

 

if we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations sales or contributions of properties or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation divesting ourselves of properties whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term at less than optimal terms incurring debt entering into leases with new customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates there can be no assurance however that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us additionally taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our business and in particular our distributable cash flow and debt covenants

 

our investments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector

 

our investments in real estate assets are primarily concentrated in the industrial distribution sector this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified

 

general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results

 

we are exposed to general economic conditions local regional national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties

 

at december 31 2015 approximately 319 of our consolidated operating properties or 77 billion based on gross book value or investment before depreciation are located in california which represented 251 of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 310 of our net operating income our revenue from and the value of our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california’s economic climate because of the number of properties we have located in california a downturn in california’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our business 

 

in addition to california we also have significant holdings defined as more than 30 of total investment before depreciation in operating properties in certain global and regional markets located in atlanta central and eastern pennsylvania chicago dallasfort worth new jerseynew york city and south florida our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties conditions such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space among other factors may impact operating conditions any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction in demand for distribution space could adversely affect our overall business 

 

in addition our owned and managed portfolio including the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures in which we invest has concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above as well as in markets in france germany japan mexico and the united kingdom and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets

 

a number of our investments both whollyowned and owned through coinvestment ventures are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity us properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the san francisco bay area los angeles and seattle international properties located in active seismic areas include japan and mexico we generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to selfinsure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis we have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for our assets in japan based on this analysis

 

furthermore a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane or flood risk we carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants 

 

investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business

 

investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio market research and our asset management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated factors that may affect real estate values include

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or release space on favorable terms as leases expire

 

our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations we are also subject to the risk that upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties leases may not be renewed by existing customers the space may not be 

released to new c ustomers or the terms of renewal or releasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or belo w the rental rates we currently charge our customers we may lose potential customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when our customers’ leases expire in the event of default by a si gnificant number of customers we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord and we may be unable to release spaces a customer may experience a downturn in its business which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease in addition a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow 

 

we may acquire properties which involves risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

 

we have acquired properties and will continue to acquire properties both through the direct acquisition of real estate and through the acquisition of entities that own the real estate and through additional investments in coinvestment ventures that acquire properties the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates when we acquire properties we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures additionally there is and it is expected there will continue to be significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities the acquired properties or entities may be subject to liabilities which may be without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based on ownership of any of these entities or properties then we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it 

 

our real estate development strategies may not be successful

 

our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through sales to third parties development of industrial properties to hold for longterm investment or contribution or sale to a coinvestment venture or third party depending on market conditions our liquidity needs and other factors we may increase our investment in the development renovation and redevelopment business and we expect to complete the buildout and leasing of our current development portfolio we may also develop renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed coinvestment ventures the real estate development renovation and redevelopment business includes the following significant risks

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming coinvestment ventures investing in new or existing coinvestment ventures attracting thirdparty investment and investing in and managing properties through coinvestment ventures

 

at december 31 2015 we had investments in real estate containing approximately 393 million square feet held through coinvestment ventures both public and private our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in these ventures and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through coinvestment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances however there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new coinvestment ventures or attract thirdparty investment or that additional investments in new or existing ventures to develop or acquire properties will be successful further there can be no assurance that we are able to realize value from such investments 

 

our coinvestment ventures involve certain additional risks that we do not otherwise face including

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our coinvestment ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives however we may not be able to continue to do so indefinitely we have formed publicly traded investment vehicles such as npr and fibra prologis for which we serve as sponsor or manager we have contributed and may continue to contribute assets into such vehicles there is a risk that our managerial relationship may be terminated 

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks including the potential impacts of future climate change which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition

 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination

 

environmental laws in some countries including the us also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of our properties are known to contain asbestoscontaining building materials

 

in addition some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances furthermore certain of our properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in connection with certain divested properties we have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties

 

we are also exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate our distribution facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events such as severe storms or floods if the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change our exposure to these events could increase we do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change as our operations generally do not emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases however we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain or stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the presence of such substances on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and this may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition and in particular our distributable cash flow

 

our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses 

 

we and our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy namely windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets we believe our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures are adequately insured certain losses however including losses from floods earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots generally are not insured against or generally are not fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property

 

furthermore we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and if there is recourse debt then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our business 

 

risks related to financing and capital 

 

we may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments

 

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and if the maturing debt is secured the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness our credit facilities and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements

 

covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition

 

the terms of our various credit agreements including our credit facilities the indentures under which our senior notes are issued and other note agreements require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage leverage ratios fixed charge ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness if we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations our business and financial condition generally and in particular the amount of our distributable cash flow could be adversely affected 

 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity

 

the credit ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing also a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our credit facilities and other debt instruments adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and in particular our refinancing and other capital market activities our ability to manage debt maturities our future growth and our development and acquisition activity

 

at december 31 2015 our credit ratings were baa1 from moody’s and bbb from sp both with outlook stable a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization

 

we depend on external sources of capital

 

to qualify as a reit we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain and we may be subject to tax to the extent our taxable income is not fully distributed historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders but we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances our own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years that ended on or before december 31 2015 and in some cases declared as late as december 31 2016 a reit can satisfy up to 90 of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital furthermore to maintain our reit status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all depends on a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities

 

our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock or units in the operating partnership

 

any additional future issuance of common stock or operating partnership units will reduce the percentage of our common stock and units owned by investors in most circumstances stockholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock or units in addition depending on the terms and pricing of any additional offering of our common stock or units and the value of the properties our stockholders and unitholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock or units

 

income tax risks 

 

the failure of prologis inc to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences

 

prologis inc elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code commencing with the taxable year ended december 31 1997 we believe we have operated prologis inc to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable prologis inc to continue to qualify as a reit however it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow prologis inc to qualify as a reit or that our future operations could cause prologis inc to fail to qualify qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some annually and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex sections of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control for example to qualify as a reit prologis inc must derive at least 95 of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition prologis inc must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis the provisions of the internal revenue code and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a reit are more complicated for prologis inc because we hold assets through the operating partnership

 

if prologis inc fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on taxable income at regular corporate rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions prologis inc would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it lost the qualification if prologis inc lost its reit status our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved

 

furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits that elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit gross income tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to us federal income tax in addition a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect on the ability of prologis inc to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus its ability to qualify as a reit

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction

 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties including by contributing properties to our coinvestment ventures under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions while we believe that the internal revenue service would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue code were to argue successfully that a transfer disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

 

legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us

 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the us and foreign income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate reits similar entities and investments additional changes are likely to continue to occur in the future both in and outside of the us and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders

we manage our business on an owned and managed basis including properties wholly owned by us or owned by one of our coinvestment ventures as further discussed we believe that the operating fundamentals of our owned and managed portfolio are consistent with those of our consolidated portfolio the activity in our owned and managed portfolio affects both our real estate operations and strategic capital segments as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures based on our ownership share

same store analysis 

 

we evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures we include properties from our consolidated portfolio as well as properties owned by the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures that we manage in our same store analysis we have defined the same store portfolio for each quarter in 2015 as those properties that were in operation at january 1 2014 and have been in operation throughout the same threemonth periods in both 2015 and 2014 we have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party or were classified as held for sale to a third party from the population for both periods we believe the factors that affect rental revenue rental expenses and noi in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total portfolio to derive an appropriate measure of periodtoperiod operating performance we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the recent period end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the us dollar for both periods

 

we calculate our same store results on a quarterly basis and provide a reconciliation of those results to the consolidated statements of income the following table summarizes same store noi and the change from prior period for the four quarters of 2015 and on a cumulative annual basis and the square feet of the portfolio used in the calculation dollars and square feet in millions 

 



 



 

the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenue rental expenses and noi calculated as rental revenue and recoveries less rental expenses for the full year as included in the consolidated statements of income to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended december 31 dollars in millions

 



 



 



 



 



 

other components of income expense 

 

ga expenses

 

the following table summarizes ga expenses for the years ended december 31 in millions

 



 

gross overhead includes all costs related to our business including those attributable to the real estate operations and strategic capital segments we allocate a portion of our gross overhead that relates to property management functions to both segments based on the size of the respective portfolios costs directly associated with strategic capital also are allocated to that segment the decrease in gross overhead from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro british pound sterling and japanese yen the increase in gross overhead from 2013 to 2014 was principally due to increased compensation 

 

we capitalize certain costs directly related to our development and leasing activities capitalized ga expenses included salaries and related costs as well as other ga costs the following table summarizes capitalized ga costs for the years ended december 31 in millions

 



 

depreciation and amortization expenses

 

depreciation and amortization expenses were 8804 million 6425 million and 6487 million for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses from 2014 to 2015 principally resulted from an increased investment in real estate properties from the ktr acquisition in may 2015 the consolidation of naif in the fourth quarter of 2014 other acquired properties and completed developments this is offset slightly by the disposition of properties the decrease from 2013 to 2014 was principally a result of the disposition and contribution of properties offset slightly by additional depreciation and amortization from completed development acquired properties and the consolidation of naif in the fourth quarter of 2014

 

earnings from unconsolidated entities net

 

we recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities that are accounted for under the equity method of 1593 million 1343 million and 972 million for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the earnings we recognize are impacted by i variances in revenues and expenses of each venture ii the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture iii gains or losses from the dispositions of properties when applicable iv our ownership interest in each venture and v fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to us dollars if applicable see the discussion of our coinvestment ventures above in the strategic capital segment discussion and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized

 

interest expense

 

gross interest expense increased in 2015 compared with 2014 due to higher debt driven by the ktr acquisition offset somewhat by a decrease in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during 2015 and 2014 we issued new debt with lower borrowing costs and used the proceeds to invest in real estate and pay down or buy back our higher cost debt gross interest expense decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 due to lower average debt levels and decreased interest rates our weighted average effective interest rate was 33 42 and 47 for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of gross interest expense amortization and capitalized amounts included in net interest expense see also the liquidity and capital resources section for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs

 

gains on dispositions of investments in real estate and revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest net 

 

we recognized gains of 7589 million 7258 million and 5977 million in continuing operations during 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively in 2015 the gains were driven primarily from dispositions to third parties in the us in 2014 the gains were driven from third party dispositions mainly in the us gains from the revaluation of our equity investment in naif upon acquisition of a controlling interest and contributions to our coinvestment ventures in mexico in 2013 the gains were driven primarily from contributions to our coinvestment ventures in europe we expect to continue to have contributions to coinvestment ventures in the future primarily in europe japan and mexico as well as make dispositions of properties to third parties primarily in the us all depending on market conditions and other factors we expect to use the proceeds from such contributions and dispositions to pay down the remaining balance of 4000 million on the term loan that was used to finance a portion of the ktr acquisition and to fund our capital deployment activities in 2016 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the gains we recognized

 

foreign currency and derivative gains losses and related amortization net 

 

to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate however we and certain of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries have intercompany or thirdparty debt that is not denominated in the entity’s functional currency when the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity a gain or loss may result to a lesser degree we also have transactions with third parties of certain assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the entities’ functional currency certain of our thirdparty and intercompany debt is remeasured with the resulting adjustment recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in foreign currency translation losses net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income this treatment is applicable to thirdparty debt that is designated as a hedge of our net investment and intercompany debt that is deemed to be longterm in nature

 

if the thirdparty debt is not designated as a hedge or the intercompany debt is deemed shortterm in nature we recognize a gain or loss in earnings when the debt is remeasured we also recognized the change in fair value of derivative transactions not designated as hedges to a lesser degree we also have transactions with third parties of certain assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the entities’ functional currency

 

the following table details our foreign currency and derivative gains losses and related amortization net for the year ended december 31 in millions

 



 



 



 



 

losses on early extinguishment of debt net

 

we repurchased portions of several series of senior notes senior exchangeable notes and secured mortgage debt which resulted in the recognition of losses of 863 million 1653 million and 2770 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of these transactions we have reduced our effective interest rate and lengthened the maturities of our debt see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our debt repurchase

 

income tax expense benefit

 

we recognize current income tax expense for income taxes incurred by our taxable reit subsidiaries state and local income taxes and taxes incurred in our foreign jurisdictions our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income deferred income tax expense benefit is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries operating in the us or in foreign jurisdictions

 

the following table summarizes our income tax expense benefit for the year ended december 31 in millions

 



 

our income taxes are discussed in more detail in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements

 

discontinued operations

 

as discussed above we adopted a new accounting standard regarding discontinued operations effective january 1 2014 and none of our property dispositions in 2015 or 2014 met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations in 2013 earnings from discontinued operations were 1235 million discontinued operations under the previous standard represent the results of operations of properties that were sold to third parties along with the related gain on sale

 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests

 

this amount represents the thirdparty investors’ share of the earnings generated in consolidated entities in which we do not own 100 of the equity reduced by the third party share of fees or promotes payable to us in 2015 2014 and 2013 we recognized net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for prologis inc of 561 million 1031 million and 101 million respectively in 2015 this is primarily related to operating activity in our consolidated coinvestment ventures naif and uslv uslv completed the ktr acquisition in may 2015 so approximately seven months of the operating activity were included offset by thirdparty share of acquisition costs and an acquisition fee payable to us we acquired a controlling interest in naif in the fourth quarter of 2014 and began consolidating the venture in 2014 we recognized net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in prologis mexico fondo logistico “afores” of 648 million because of the fibra 

prologis transaction primarily related to the thirdparty investors’ share of the gain on disposition and the net deferred income tax benefit see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our consolidated coinvestment ventures 

 

other comprehensive income loss – foreign currency translation losses net

 

we recognize unrealized gains or losses related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities into us dollars along with realized and unrealized gains or losses associated with the changes in the fair value of derivative and nonderivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations

 

during 2015 2014 and 2013 we recorded net losses of 2089 million 1714 million and 2347 million respectively during 2015 and 2014 the unrealized losses were principally due to the weakening of the euro british pound sterling japanese yen and brazilian real to the us dollar from the beginning of the period to the end of the period in 2013 the unrealized losses included approximately 1900 million of foreign currency translation losses on the properties contributed to pelp and npr due to the weakening of the euro and japanese yen respectively to the us dollar from december 31 2012 through the date of the contributions also in 2013 we recorded unrealized losses due to the weakening of the japanese yen to the us dollar from the beginning of the period to the end of the period see note 16 in the consolidated financial statements for further detail

 

environmental matters

 

a majority of the properties we acquired were subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see note 17 in the consolidated financial statements for further information about environmental liabilities

 

liquidity and capital resources

 

overview

nearterm principal cash sources and uses

 

in addition to dividends to the common and preferred stockholders of prologis and distributions to the holders of limited partnership units of the operating partnership and our partners in the consolidated coinvestment ventures we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we expect to fund our cash needs principally from the following sources all subject to market conditions

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we may also generate proceeds from the issuance of equity securities subject to market conditions

 

debt

 

the following table summarizes information about our debt at december 31 in millions

 



 

as discussed earlier and in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements we completed the ktr acquisition on may 29 2015 to fund our share of the cash portion approximately 26 billion as well as our other net cash requirements we borrowed 4402 million under our credit facilities and entered into the following debt arrangements during the second quarter of 2015

 



 



 



 

we expect to repay the 4000 million remaining balance on the senior term loan that was used to fund the ktr acquisition with proceeds generated from the contributions of certain development properties to our coinvestment ventures in europe japan and mexico and proceeds generated from the disposition of certain nonstrategic properties to third parties 

 

in october 2015 we issued 7500 million in principal amount of senior notes with an interest rate of 38 maturing in 2025 we used a portion of the net proceeds to repurchase approximately 512 million of our senior unsecured notes including fees with an average interest rate of 56 maturing in 2017 and 2018 we also commenced a tender offer through which we utilized a portion of the net proceeds to repurchase a portion of our senior notes that mature in 2019 and 2020 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 289 million including fees and accrued interest which had an average interest rate of 70 a portion of the remaining proceeds was used for other corporate purposes including other debt repayment and repurchases

 

in december 2015 we entered into an unsecured senior term loan under which we can draw in canadian dollars in an aggregate amount not to exceed cad 3719 million 2679 million at december 31 2015 that matures in 2023 which was fully drawn at december 31 2015 we used the proceeds to pay down our credit facilities and for general corporate purposes

 

at december 31 2015 we had credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 26 billion all of which was available for borrowing

 

at december 31 2015 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants these covenants include customary financial covenants for total debt encumbered debt and fixed charge coverage ratios see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our debt

 

equity commitments related to certain coinvestment ventures

 

certain coinvestment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash we may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash for more information on equity commitments for our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we have one consolidated coinvestment venture the brazil fund with equity commitments at december 31 2015 of 448 million of which 224 million is our share and expires in december 2017 the equity commitments are denominated in brazilian real and called and reported in us dollars

 

cash flow summary 

 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended december 31 in millions

 



 

cash provided by operating activities

 

in 2015 and 2014 cash provided by operating activities was more than the cash dividends paid on common and preferred stock by 1587 million and 323 million respectively in 2013 cash provided by operating activities was less than the cash dividends paid on common and preferred stock by 889 million in 2013 we had other sources of cash that we used including proceeds from dispositions to third parties and contributions of real estate properties 54 billion and distributions from our coinvestment ventures classified for a return of investment for reporting purposes 4119 million both of which are included in investing activities we used some of this cash to fund dividends not covered by cash provided by operating activities as disclosed in note 9 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements we paid combined amounts for interest and income taxes of 3700 million 3638 million and 5260 million respectively in 2015 2014 and 2013 in addition our cash provided by operating activities exclusive of changes in receivables and payables is impacted by the following significant activity

off balance shee t arrangements 

 

unconsolidated coinvestment venture debt

 

we had investments in and advances to our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures at december 31 2015 of 46 billion these ventures had total thirdparty debt of 62 billion of which 18 billion was our proportionate share at december 31 2015 this debt is primarily secured is nonrecourse to prologis or the other investors in the coinvestment ventures and matures as follows dollars in millions

 



 

at december 31 2015 we did not guarantee any thirdparty debt of the coinvestment ventures in our role as the manager we work with the coinvestment ventures to refinance their maturing debt there can be no assurance that the coinvestment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt or at all if the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets certain of our ventures also have credit facilities or unencumbered properties both of which may be used to obtain funds

 

contractual obligations

 

longterm contractual obligations

 

the following table summarizes our longterm contractual obligations at december 31 2015 in millions

 



 



 

distribution and dividend requirements

 

our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the internal revenue code relative to maintaining our reit status while still allowing us to retain cash to meet other needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities

 

in 2015 we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 036 for the first two quarters of 2015 and 040 per common share for the last two quarters of 2015 in the fourth quarter of 2015 we issued a new class of common limited partnership units in the operating partnership that are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to 064665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least 040 per unit see note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for more information on this new partnership unit we paid a dividend of 064665 in december 2015 related to this new partnership unit we paid quarterly cash dividends of 033 per common share for all four quarters of 2014 our future common stock dividends if and as declared may vary and will be determined by the board upon the circumstances prevailing at the time including our financial condition operating results and reit distribution requirements and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year

 

at december 31 2015 we had one series of preferred stock outstanding – the “series q preferred stock” the annual dividend rate is 854 per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears

 

pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock

 

other commitments

 

on a continuing basis we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties

 

critical accounting policies 

 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity’s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management generally the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of 

our performance of the accounting policies discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies 

 

consolidation

 

we consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100 of the equity but control as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate our ability to control an entity including whether the entity is a variable interest entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary we consider the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity investments in entities that we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in the consolidated financial statements

 

business combinations

 

upon acquisition of real estate that constitutes a business which includes acquiring a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based on the fair value of each component the components typically include land building intangible assets related to the acquired leases debt deferred tax liability and other assumed assets and liabilities in the case of an acquisition of a business in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located the fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties in the case of an acquisition of a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting this allocation may result in a gain or a loss the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment which may differ when final information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period not to exceed one year the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses

 

revenue recognition – gains losses on dispositions of investments in real estate and strategic capital revenue

 

we recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets generally at the time the title is transferred consideration is received and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold in many of our transactions an entity in which we have an equity investment will acquire a real estate asset from us we make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the entity that acquires the assets in addition we make judgments regarding recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives earned for services provided to these entities based on when they are earned fixed and determinable

 

derivative financial instruments

 

derivative financial instruments can be designated as fair value hedges cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that at inception and over the term of the instruments the hedged item and derivative qualify for hedge accounting the rules and interpretations for derivatives are complex failure to apply this guidance correctly may result in all changes in fair value of the hedged derivative being recognized in earnings

 

we assess both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures any ineffective portion of a derivative financial instruments change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings derivatives not designated as hedges are used to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and variable interest rates but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our derivative financial instrument policy

 

income taxes

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to estimate our income tax liability for each taxable entity the liability associated with open tax years that are under review our reit taxable income and our compliance with reit requirements our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws we estimate our actual current income tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities these estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain nonroutine transactions changes due to audit adjustments by federal international and state tax authorities our inability to qualify as a reit the potential for builtin gain recognition changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to taxable reit subsidiaries and changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within income tax expense we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities

 

other than temporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated entities

 

when circumstances indicate the value of an equity investment may be reduced we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary if we determine that a loss in value is other than temporary we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value the use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value the determination of when a loss is other than temporary and the calculation of the amount of the loss is complex and subjective use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions changes in economic and operating conditions as well as changes in our intent with regard to our investment that occur subsequent to our review could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our equity investments

 

impairment of longlived assets

 

we assess the carrying values of our respective longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable

 

recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models applying a capitalization rate to estimated noi of a property quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals where considered necessary the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of a real estate property that we expect to hold is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property assumptions and estimates used in 

the recoverability analyses for future cash flows discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subj ective changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our longlived assets 

 

capitalization of costs 

 

we capitalize costs incurred in developing renovating rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred during the land development and construction periods we capitalize interest costs insurance real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets

 

new accounting pronouncements

 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

 

fu nds from operations attributable to common stockholders and unitholders “ffo” 

 

ffo is a financial measure that is not determined in accordance with gaap but is a measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings although the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” has published a definition of ffo modifications to the nareit calculation of ffo are common among reits as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business 

 

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor do we intend it to present a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance we believe that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap furthermore we believe our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition

 

nareit’s ffo measure adjusts net earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales along with impairment charges of previously depreciated properties we agree that these nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons

 



 



 

our ffo measures

 

at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community” we believe stockholders potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating results are best served by a defined ffo measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of ffo our ffo measures are used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe that it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses

 

we calculate our ffo measures as defined below based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures we reflect our share of our ffo measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our ffo measures to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on average ownership percentage for the applicable periods 

 

we use these ffo measures including by segment and region to i evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general and v evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a longterm outlook we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of shortterm items that we do not expect to affect the underlying longterm performance of the properties the longterm performance of our properties is principally driven by rental revenue while not infrequent or unusual these additional items we exclude in calculating ffo as defined by prologis defined below are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative shortterm effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our longterm outlook

 

we use our ffo measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance we do not use our ffo measures as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap as indicators of our operating performance as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs

 

ffo as defined by prologis attributable to common stockholders and unitholders “ffo as defined by prologis” 

 

to arrive at ffo as defined by prologis  we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude

 



 



 



 



 



 

we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy

 

core ffo attributable to common stockholders and unitholders “core ffo”

 

in addition to ffo as defined by prologis  we also use core ffo  to arrive at core ffo  we adjust ffo as defined by prologis to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly in ffo as defined by prologis 

 



 



 



 



 



 

we believe it is appropriate to further adjust our ffo as defined by prologis for certain recurring items as they were driven by transactional activity and factors relating to the financial and real estate markets rather than factors specific to the ongoing operating performance of our properties or investments the impairment charges we have recognized were primarily based on valuations of real estate which had declined due to market conditions that we no longer expected to hold for longterm investment over the last few years we made it a priority to strengthen our financial position by reducing our debt our investment in certain low yielding assets and our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations as a result we changed our intent to sell or contribute certain of our real estate properties and recorded impairment charges when we did not expect to recover the costs of our investment also we purchased portions of our debt securities when we believed it was advantageous to do so which was based on market conditions and in an effort to lower our borrowing costs and extend our debt maturities as a result we have recognized net gains or losses on the early extinguishment of certain debt due to the financial market conditions at that time 

 

we analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental revenue of our real estate and the revenue driven by our strategic capital business net of operating administrative and financing expenses this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities although these items discussed above have had a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term 

 

we use core ffo  including by segment and region to i evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance v assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general and vi evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a longterm outlook we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of items that we do not expect to affect the underlying longterm performance of the properties we own as noted above we believe the longterm performance of our properties is principally driven by rental revenue we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy 

 

limitations on the use of our ffo measures

 

while we believe our defined ffo measures are important supplemental measures neither nareit’s nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are therefore limited as an analytical tool accordingly these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business some of these limitations are

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions this information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap to assist investors in compensating for these limitations we reconcile our defined ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap for the years ended december 31 as follows in millions

 



 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to the impact of foreignexchange related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments and interest rate changes see our risk factors in item 1a risk factors specifically the following the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and we may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments see also notes 2 and 16 in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information about our foreign operations and derivative financial instruments

 

we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in exchange or interest rates at december 31 2015 the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following sections the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value as a result revenues and expenses as well as our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates

 

foreign currency risk

 

we are exposed to foreign exchangerelated variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our financial results or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2015 we had net equity of approximately 16 billion or 85 of total net equity denominated in a currency other than the us dollar after consideration of our derivative and nonderivative financial instruments based on our sensitivity analysis a 10 reduction in exchange rates would cause a reduction of 1621 million to our net equity

 

at december 31 2015 we had foreign currency forward contracts which were designated and qualify as net investment hedges with an aggregate notional amount of 3861 million to hedge a portion of our investments in the united kingdom we also have foreign currency forward contracts which were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges with an aggregate notional amount of 48 million to hedge cash payments for development in mexico on the basis of our sensitivity analysis a weakening of the us dollar against the british pound sterling or mexican peso by 10 would result in a 391 million negative change in our cash flows on settlement in addition we also have british pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen forward and option contracts which were not designated as hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of 6117 million to mitigate risk associated with the translation of the projected financial results of our subsidiaries in europe canada and japan a weakening of the us dollar against these currencies by 10 would result in a 612 million negative change in our net income on settlement

 

interest rate r isk 

 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows at december 31 2015 we had 24 billion of variable rate debt outstanding of which 21 billion was outstanding on our term loans and 2987 million was outstanding on secured mortgage debt we had no outstanding balances on our credit facilities at december 31 2015 we had entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix 11 billion of our japanese yen term loans ¥1059 billion and our canadian term loan cad 3719 million during the year ended december 31 2015 we had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of 2573 million on our variable rate credit facilities on the basis of our sensitivity analysis a 10 adverse change in interest rates based on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances not subject to interest rate swap agreements during the period would result in additional interest expense of 29 million which equates to a change in interest rates of 20 basis points

 prologis inc began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended “internal revenue code” we believe the current organization and method of operation will enable prologis inc to maintain its status as a reit the operating partnership also was formed in 1997

investment strategy 

both macroeconomics and demographics are important drivers of our business including population growth consumption and rising affluence in developed markets including in the us europe and japan the reconfiguration of supply chains and the operational efficiencies that can be realized from our modern logistics facilities are an important driver in emerging markets such as mexico brazil and china increases in affluence and the rise of consumer classes create demand as new supply chains are constructed taken together logistics real estate markets benefit from economic growth but depend to a greater degree upon the modernization of supply chains around the world and demographic growth 

we have investments in entities through a variety of ventures we coinvest with partners and investors in entities that own multiple properties and provide asset and property management services to these entities we refer to these entities as coinvestment ventures these entities may be consolidated or unconsolidated depending on the structure our partners’ participating and other rights and our level of control the coinvestment ventures may have one or more investors 

our investment strategy focuses on providing distribution facilities to customers whose businesses are tied to global trade and depend on the efficient movement of goods through the global supply chain we have a deep worldwide presence of 456 billion based on expected investment in our owned and managed portfolio spanning 21 countries on four continents we classify our properties into two main market categories global and regional global markets comprise approximately 30 of the largest markets tied to global trade they feature large population centers with high percapita consumption rates and are near major airports seaports and ground transportation systems regional markets benefit from large population centers but typically are not as tied to the global supply chain instead they serve local consumption and are less supply constrained we intend to hold primarily classa product in our global and regional markets at december 31 2014 global and regional markets represented approximately 86 and 13 respectively of our owned and managed portfolio based on our share of the properties’ gross book value we also have a small investment in other markets that accounts for approximately 1 of our owned and managed portfolio we have deep knowledge of our local markets construction expertise and a commitment to sustainable design across our portfolio we are supported by a broad and diverse customer base and have relationships with multinational corporations that bring us repeat business across our portfolio for more detail on our properties see item 2 properties 

business strategy and operating segments 

our business comprises two operating segments real estate operations and strategic capital 

real estate operations 

rental operations rental operations represent the main source of our revenues earnings and funds from operations “ffo” see definition and a complete reconciliation of net earnings to ffo in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we collect rent from our customers through operating leases including reimbursements for the majority of our operating costs we expect to generate longterm internal growth in rental income by maintaining high occupancy rates controlling expenses and through rent increases our rental income is diversified due to our global presence and broad customer base we believe our property management leasing and maintenance teams together with our capital expenditure energy management and risk management programs create cost efficiencies that allow us to capitalize on the economies of scale inherent in owning operating and growing a global portfolio 

capital deployment capital deployment includes the development redevelopment and acquisition of industrial properties that lead to rental operations and is therefore included with rental operations for segment reporting we deploy capital primarily in global and regional markets to meet our customers’ needs we capitalize on the following i our land bank ii the development expertise of our local teams iii our global customer relationships and iv the demand for highquality distribution facilities we aim to increase our rental income and the company’s net asset value by leasing newly developed space and acquiring operating properties we develop properties for longterm hold for contribution to our coinvestment ventures and occasionally for sale to third parties 

strategic capital 

we invest with partners and investors through private and public ventures which may be consolidated or unconsolidated we tailor industrial portfolios to investors’ specific needs with a focus on longterm ventures and openended funds we also access alternative sources of equity through publicly traded vehicles such as nippon prologis reit inc “npr” and fibra prologis these private and public vehicles provide capital for distinct geographies across our global platform we hold a significant ownership interest in these ventures aligning our interests with those of our partners we generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated ventures through asset 

  

management and property management services and we earn additional revenues from leasing acquisition construction development and disposition services provided depending on the structure of the venture and the returns provided to our partners we also earn revenues through incentive fees during the life of a venture or upon liquidation we refer to these incentive fees as promotes we believe our coinvestment ventures will continue to serve as a source of capital for investments provide incremental revenues and mitigate risk associated with our foreign currency exposure we plan to grow this business generally through existing ventures 

competition 

competitively priced distribution space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge which in turn could affect both of our operating segments to the extent we wish to acquire land for development or dispose of land we may compete with local regional and national operators andor developers we also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business 

we believe we have competitive advantages due to our 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 customers 

our broad customer base represents a spectrum of international national regional and local distribution users at december 31 2014 in real estate operations we had more than 3900 customers occupying 2716 million square feet of distribution space on an owned and managed basis we had more than 4700 customers occupying 5191 million square feet of distribution space our largest customer and 25 largest customers accounted for 19 and 195 respectively of our net effective rent at december 31 2014 for real estate operations and 21 and 186 respectively for our owned and managed portfolio 

in strategic capital we view our partners and investors as our customers at december 31 2014 in our private ventures we partnered with more than 100 investors several of which invest in multiple ventures 

employees 

we employ 1505 people across the globe our employees work in four countries in the americas 900 people 14 countries in europe 360 people and three countries in asia 245 people of the total we have assigned 955 employees to real estate operations and 90 employees to strategic capital further we have 460 individuals who work in corporate and support positions that support both segments we believe we have good relationships with our employees prologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements although some employees in europe are represented by statutory works councils and as such they benefit from applicable labor agreements 

code of ethics and business conduct 

we maintain a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to our board of directors “board” and all of our officers and employees including the principal executive officer the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer or persons performing similar functions a copy of our code of ethics and business conduct is available on our website wwwprologiscom in addition to being accessible through our website copies of our code of ethics and business conduct can be obtained free of charge upon written request to investor relations pier 1 bay 1 san francisco california 94111 any amendments to or waivers of our code of ethics and business conduct that apply to the principal executive officer the principal financial officer or the principal accounting officer or persons performing similar functions and that relate to any matter enumerated in item 406b of regulation sk will be disclosed on our website 

environmental matters 

we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition either the previous owners or we have subjected a majority of the properties we have acquired including land to environmental reviews while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments has revealed an 

  

environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see item 1a risk factors and note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

insurance coverage 

we carry insurance coverage on our properties we determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance self insurance and through a whollyowned captive insurance entity the costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through reimbursements from our customers we believe that our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured see further discussion in item 1a risk factors 




 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations distributable cash flow and value of our securities these risks include among others 

general 

as a global company we are subject to social political and economic risks of doing business in many countries 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states during 2014 we generated approximately 3696 million or 210 of our revenue from operations outside the united states circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flow include but are not limited to the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our global growth also subjects us to certain risks including risks associated with funding increasing headcount integrating new offices and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws 

although we have committed substantial resources to expand our global platform if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow could be harmed 

in addition we may be impacted by the ability of our nonunited states subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt due to by currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other things 

the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the functional currency at december 31 2014 approximately 64 billion or 249 of our total assets are invested in a currency other than the us dollar 

  

primarily the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen as a result we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our us dollar reported financial position debt covenant ratios results of operations and cash flow although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and using derivative contracts there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency the funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of the hedged foreign currency the failure to hedge effectively against exchange rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

to the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets it has the potential to adversely affect the value of our properties and investments in our unconsolidated entities the availability or the terms of financing that we and our unconsolidated entities have or may anticipate utilizing our ability and that of our unconsolidated entities to make principal and interest payments on or refinance any outstanding debt when due and may impact the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases 

any additional continued or recurring disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

risks related to our business 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets which may reduce economic returns to investors 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions in addition significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as secured mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments like other companies qualifying as reits under the internal revenue code we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable reit subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property while we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment in order to generate liquidity if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale we may not pursue such sales 

in the event that we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation divesting ourselves of properties whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term at less than optimal terms incurring debt entering into leases with new customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates there can be no assurance however that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us additionally taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results 

we are exposed to general economic conditions local regional national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties 

at december 31 2014 approximately 336 of our consolidated operating properties or 63 billion based on investment before depreciation are located in california which represented 259 of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 319 of our net operating income our revenue from and the value of our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california’s economic climate because of the number of properties we have located in california a downturn in california’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

in addition to california we also have significant holdings defined as more than 3 of total investment before depreciation in operating properties in certain global and regional markets located in central  eastern pennsylvania chicago dallasfort worth new jerseynew york city south florida and canada our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties conditions such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space among other factors may impact operating conditions any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction in demand for distribution space could adversely affect our results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of our securities 

in addition the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures in which we invest have concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above as well as in markets in france germany japan mexico the netherlands poland and the united kingdom and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets 

  

a number of our investments both whollyowned and owned through coinvestment ventures are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity united states properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the san francisco bay area los angeles and seattle international properties located in active seismic areas include japan and mexico we generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to self insure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis we have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for our assets in japan based on this analysis 

further a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane andor flood risk we carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants 

our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses 

we and our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures currently carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy namely windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets we believe our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures are adequately insured however there are certain losses including losses from floods earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property 

furthermore we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and if there is recourse debt then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business 

investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio market research and our property management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated some of the factors that may affect real estate values include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our investments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector 

our investments in real estate assets are primarily concentrated in the industrial distribution sector this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified 

our operating results and distributable cash flow will depend on the continued generation of lease revenues from customers and we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or release space on favorable terms as leases expire 

our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations we are also subject to the risk that upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties leases may not be 

  

renewed by existing customers the space may not be released to new customers or the terms of renewal or releasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers we may lose potential customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain customers when our customers’ leases expire in the event of default by a significant number of customers we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord and may be unable to release spaces a customer may experience a downturn in its business which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease in addition a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow 

we may acquire properties which involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results and the value of our securities 

we have acquired properties and will continue to acquire properties both through the direct acquisition of real estate and through the acquisition of entities that own the real estate the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates when we acquire properties we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures additionally there is and it is expected there will continue to be significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities the acquired properties or entities may also be subject to liabilities which may be without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties then we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it 

our real estate development strategies may not be successful 

our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through sales to third parties development of industrial properties to hold for longterm investment or contribution or sale to a coinvestment venture depending on market conditions our liquidity needs and other factors we may increase our investment in the development renovation and redevelopment business and we will complete the buildout and leasing of our development portfolio we may also develop renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed development coinvestment ventures the real estate development renovation and redevelopment business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities which include the following risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our operating results financial condition and cash flow 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination  

  

environmental laws in some countries including the united states also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of our properties are known to contain asbestoscontaining building materials 

in addition some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances further certain of our properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in connection with certain divested properties we have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties 

we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the presence of such substances on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow 

if we decide to contribute or sell properties to unconsolidated coinvestment ventures or third parties to generate proceeds we may not be successful 

we may decide to contribute or sell properties to certain of our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures or third parties depending on a number of factors our ability to sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties market conditions including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties and other factors beyond our control if our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets andor at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or at all the unconsolidated coinvestment venture or third party who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital in the private and public markets in order to acquire properties from us should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then dispositions could be delayed if we are unable to generate proceeds through property sales this may result in adverse effects on our liquidity distributable cash flow debt covenants and the market price of our securities 

we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming coinvestment ventures investing in new or existing coinvestment ventures attracting thirdparty investment and investing in and managing properties through coinvestment ventures 

at december 31 2014 we had an investment in real estate containing approximately 261 million square feet held through unconsolidated coinvestment ventures both public and private our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in unconsolidated ventures and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through coinvestment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances however there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new coinvestment ventures attract thirdparty investment or make additional investments in new or existing ventures successfully develop or acquire properties through unconsolidated ventures or realize value from such investments our inability to do so may have an adverse effect on our growth results of operations cash flows and the market price of our securities 

our coinvestment ventures involve certain additional risks that we do not otherwise face including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our coinvestment ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives however we may not be able to continue to do so indefinitely we have formed publicly traded investment vehicles such as npr and fibra prologis for which we serve as sponsor andor manager we have contributed and may continue to contribute assets into such vehicles there is a risk that our managerial relationship may be terminated 

  

the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

risks related to financing and capital 

we face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business activities including refinancing and interest rate risks which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition if we are unable to make required payments on our debt or are unable to refinance our debt 

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected and if the maturing debt is secured the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness our credit facilities and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements from time to time we may enter into interest rate swap or cap agreements such hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements the funds required to settle any swap breakage arrangements if any could be significant depending on the size of the underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of breakage the failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position in addition our coinvestment ventures may be unable to refinance indebtedness or meet payment obligations which may impact our distributable cash flow and our financial condition 

covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition 

the terms of our various credit agreements including our credit facilities the indentures under which our senior notes are issued and other note agreements require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage leverage ratios fixed charge ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness if we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations the amount of our distributable cash flow our operating results and our financial condition could be adversely affected 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity 

the credit ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing also a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our refinancing and other capital market activities our ability to manage debt maturities our future growth our financial condition the market price of our securities and our development and acquisition activity 

at december 31 2014 our credit ratings were baa1 from moody’s and bbb from sp both with outlook stable a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization 

we are dependent on external sources of capital 

in order to qualify as a reit we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain and we may be subject to tax to the extent our taxable income is not fully distributed while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances our own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december 31 2014 and in some cases declared as late as december 31 2015 the reit can satisfy up to 90 of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital further in order to maintain our reit status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities 

  

our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock or units in the operating partnership 

any additional future issuance of common stock or operating partnership units will reduce the percentage of our common stockunits owned by investors in most circumstances stockholdersunitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stockunits in addition depending on the terms and pricing of any additional offering of our common stockunits and the value of the properties our stockholdersunitholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stockunits 

federal income tax risks 

our failure of prologis inc to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences 

prologis inc elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code commencing with the taxable year ended december 31 1997 we believe we have operated prologis inc to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable prologis inc to continue to qualify as a reit however it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow prologis inc to qualify as a reit or that our future operations could cause prologis inc to fail to qualify qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some annually and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex sections of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control for example in order to qualify as a reit prologis inc must derive at least 95 of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition prologis inc must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis the provisions of the internal revenue code and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a reit are more complicated for prologis inc because we hold assets through the operating partnership 

if prologis inc fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on taxable income at regular corporate rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions prologis inc would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it lost the qualification if prologis inc lost its reit status our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved 

furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit gross income tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to united states federal income tax in addition a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect the ability of prologis inc to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus its ability to qualify as a reit 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties including by contributing properties to our coinvestment ventures under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions while we believe that the internal revenue service would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue code were to argue successfully that a transfer disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 

legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax taws applicable to investments in reits and similar entities additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders 

other risks 

our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks 

despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks such as computer viruses or unauthorized access any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business we may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions any compromise of our security could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws unauthorized access to information of ours and others significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business 

  

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees from time to time our personnel and their roles may change while we believe that we retain our key talent and find suitable employees to meet our personnel needs the loss of key personnel any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market price of our securities if we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs 

under the americans with disabilities act places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants if we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the americans with disabilities act including removing access barriers then our cash flow and the amounts available to make distributions and payments to our security holders may be adversely affected our properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and lifesafety requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements while we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations restatements of our financial statements a decline in the price of our securities or otherwise materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate changerelated risks 

we are exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate our distribution facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events such as severe storms andor floods if the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change our exposure to these events could increase 

we do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change as our operations do not emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases however we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain andor stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings

 strategic capital 

included in this segment is income comprised of fees and promotes earned for services performed for our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures reduced by the expenses recognized for the direct costs associated with the asset management of these ventures and allocated propertylevel management costs for the properties owned by the ventures income associated with strategic capital fluctuates due to the size of coinvestment ventures that are under management the transactional activity in the venture and the timing of promotes we had significant coinvestment venture activity in 2014 and 2013 that impacted strategic capital noi as detailed below 

strategic capital noi for the years ended december 31 was as follows in thousands 

 

   

we had the following assets under management held through our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures at december 31 as follows dollars and square feet in millions 

 

 below are the key drivers of strategic capital noi 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the direct costs associated with strategic capital totaled 965 million 893 million and 638 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively and are included in the line item strategic capital expenses in the consolidated statements of operations these expenses include the direct expenses associated with asset management of the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures and the property management expenses associated with the propertylevel management of the properties owned by these ventures 

the increase in strategic capital expenses in 2014 from 2013 was due to the increased size of our coinvestment ventures and additional expense that represents the associated bonus paid pursuant to the terms of the prologis promote plan for the promote we earned offset partially by the conclusion of several ventures the increase in strategic capital expenses in 2013 from 2012 was due to the addition of the two coinvestment ventures in europe and asia and additional expense related to the promote we earned offset somewhat by the conclusion of several ventures 

see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconsolidated entities 

our owned and managed portfolio 

we manage our business on an owned and managed basis without regard to whether a particular property is whollyowned by us or owned by one of our coinvestment ventures as further discussed below we believe that the operating fundamentals of our owned and managed portfolio are consistent with those of our consolidated portfolio the activity in our owned and managed portfolio impacts real estate operations noi strategic capital revenues and the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures

same store analysis 

we evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures we include properties from our consolidated portfolio as well as properties owned by the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures that are managed by us in our same store analysis we have defined the same store portfolio for the three months ended december 31 2014 as those properties that were in operation at january 1 2013 and have been in operation throughout the same threemonth periods in both 2014 and 2013 we have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party or were classified as held for sale from the population for both periods we believe the factors that impact rental income rental expenses and noi in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total portfolio in order to derive an appropriate measure of periodtoperiod operating performance we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the current exchange rate to translate from local currency into us dollars for both periods 

we calculate our same store results on a quarterly basis and provide a reconciliation of those results to our consolidated statements of operations the following is a summary of same store noi and the change from prior period for the four quarters of 2014 and on a cumulative yeartodate basis and the square feet of the portfolio used in the calculation dollars and square feet in thousands 

 

   

 the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental income rental expenses and noi calculated as rental income and recoveries less rental expenses for the full year as included in the consolidated statements of operations to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended december 31 dollars in thousands 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 other components of income 

general and administrative “ga” expenses 

ga expenses for the years ended december 31 consisted of the following in thousands 

 

 gross overhead includes all costs related to our business including the real estate operations and strategic capital segments we allocate a portion of our gross overhead that relates to property management functions to both segments based on the size of the respective portfolios costs directly associated to strategic capital are allocated to that segment 

the increase in gross overhead from 2013 to 2014 was principally due to increased compensation the increase in gross overhead from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to increased infrastructure to accommodate our growing business in 2013 the gross book value for our owned and managed portfolio increased 14 billion to 455 billion at december 31 2013 

we capitalize certain costs directly related to our development and leasing activities capitalized ga expenses included salaries and related costs as well as other general and administrative costs the capitalized ga costs for the years ended december 31 were as follows in thousands 

 

 in 2014 2013 and 2012 the capitalized salaries and related costs represented 239 237 and 203 respectively of our total salaries and related costs which includes cash and equity compensation and other employeerelated expenses 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization was 6425 million 6487 million and 7243 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the decrease over the last two years was principally a result of the disposition and contribution of properties offset slightly by additional depreciation and amortization from completed development and acquired properties 

  

merger acquisition and other integration expenses 

we incurred significant transaction integration and transitional costs in 2012 related to the merger in 2011 and integration of systems see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on these expenses 

impairment of real estate properties 

during 2012 we recognized impairment charges of real estate properties in continuing operations due to our change of intent to no longer hold certain assets for longterm investment see notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on the process we took to value these assets and the related impairment charges recognized 

earnings from unconsolidated entities net 

we recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities that are accounted for under the equity method of 1343 million 972 million and 317 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the earnings we recognize are impacted by i changes in revenues and expenses of each venture ii the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture iii our ownership interest in each venture and iv fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to us dollars if applicable see the discussion of our coinvestment ventures above in the strategic capital segment discussion and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized 

interest expense 

gross interest expense decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower average debt levels and a decrease in interest rates although our debt levels were consistent at year ends 94 billion at december 31 2014 compared to 90 billion at december 31 2013 we had higher debt outstanding during the first quarter of 2013 we decreased our debt by 27 billion near the end of the first quarter of 2013 primarily from the proceeds received from the contributions made to our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures 

gross interest expense decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower debt levels 

our weighted average effective interest rate was 42 47 and 46 for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively during 2014 2013 and 2012 we issued new debt with lower borrowing costs and used the proceeds to pay down or buy back our higher cost debt 

see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of gross interest expense amortization and capitalized amounts included in net interest expense 

see also liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs 

gains on dispositions of investments in real estate and revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest net 

we recognized 07 billion 06 billion and 03 billion in continuing operations during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively in 2014 these also included gains on the dispositions of properties to third parties due to the change in reporting under the new accounting standard we expect to have contributions to coinvestments in the future primarily in europe japan and mexico as well as the disposition of properties to third parties primarily in the us all depending on market conditions and other factors see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the gains we recognized 

foreign currency and derivative gains losses net 

to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate however we and certain of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries have intercompany or thirdparty debt that is not denominated in the entity’s functional currency when the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity a gain or loss may result certain of our thirdparty and intercompany debt is remeasured with the resulting adjustment recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in foreign currency translation losses net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss this treatment is applicable to thirdparty debt that is designated as a hedge of our net investment and intercompany debt that is deemed to be longterm in nature 

if the thirdparty debt is not designated as a hedge or the intercompany debt is deemed shortterm in nature we recognize a gain or loss in earnings when the debt is remeasured we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of 45 million in 2014 and exchange gains of 92 million and 74 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively related to the settlement and remeasurement of debt predominantly the gains or losses recognized in earnings relate to the remeasurement of intercompany loans between the united states parent and certain consolidated subsidiaries in japan and europe and result from fluctuations in the exchange rates of us dollar to the euro japanese yen and british pound sterling in addition we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of 06 million 06 million and 56 million from the settlement of transactions with third parties of certain assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

we recognized unrealized losses of 133 million 422 million and 223 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively on the derivative instrument exchange feature related to our exchangeable senior notes which are due in march 2015 

  

gains losses on early extinguishment of debt net 

during 2014 2013 and 2012 we purchased portions of several series of senior notes senior exchangeable notes and extinguished some secured mortgage debt prior to maturity which resulted in the recognition of losses of 1653 million 2770 million and 141 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our debt repurchases 

income tax benefit expense 

during 2014 2013 and 2012 our current income tax expense was 616 million 1262 million and 179 million respectively we recognize current income tax expense for income taxes incurred by our taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” state and local income taxes and taxes incurred in our foreign jurisdictions our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income current income tax expense recognized during 2014 is principally due to tax triggered upon the contribution of the initial portfolio of properties by certain whollyowned entities and mexico fondo logistico “afores” to fibra prologis as the transaction was structured as an asset sale for mexican tax purposes the tax expense was offset slightly by the net current tax benefit from the operating losses generated by our united states trs the current tax expense recognized during 2013 was due to the initial contribution of certain properties to pelp and npr that were previously held in foreign jurisdictions and united states trss 

during 2014 2013 and 2012 we recognized a deferred tax benefit of 872 million 194 million and 143 million respectively deferred income tax benefit expense is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries operating in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions during 2014 the majority of the deferred tax benefit we recognized was a result of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities of 628 million as part of the fibra prologis transaction 304 million was offset by current income tax expense and 271 million due to the expiration of the holding period on properties previously acquired with existing builtin gains 

our income taxes are discussed in more detail in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

discontinued operations 

as discussed above we adopted a new accounting standard regarding discontinued operations effective january 1 2014 and none of our property dispositions in 2014 met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations in 2014 2013 and 2012 earnings from discontinued operations were 1235 million and 759 million respectively discontinued operations under the previous standard represent the results of operations of properties that were sold to third parties along with the related gain or loss on sale 

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 

this amount represents the thirdparty investors’ share of the earnings generated in consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity as well as the limited partners’ interests in the operating partnership in 2014 we recognized net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in afores of 648 million due to the fibra prologis transaction primarily related to the thirdparty investors’ share of the gain on disposition and the net deferred income tax benefit 

in 2013 we earned a promote of 188 million from the cumulative returns of the investors of our consolidated coinvestment venture prologis institutional alliance fund ii over the life of the venture of that amount 135 million represents the thirdparty investors’ portion and is reflected as a component of noncontrolling interest 

see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our consolidated coinvestment ventures 

other comprehensive income loss – foreign currency translation losses net 

we recognized unrealized gains or losses related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities into us dollars along with realized and unrealized gains or losses associated with the changes in the fair value of derivative and nonderivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations during 2014 we recorded net losses of 1714 million principally due to the weakening of the japanese yen euro and british pound sterling to the us dollar from the beginning of the period to the end of the period in 2013 we recorded net losses of 2347 million which included approximately 190 million of foreign currency translation losses on the properties contributed to pelp and npr due to the weakening of the euro and japanese yen respectively to the us dollar from december 31 2012 through the date of the contributions also in 2013 we recorded net unrealized losses due to the weakening of the japanese yen to the us dollar from the beginning of the period to the end of the period during 2012 we recorded net losses of 790 million as the japanese yen weakened relative to the us dollar offset slightly by the euro and british pound sterling slightly strengthening against the us dollar from the beginning of the period to the end of the period see note 18 in the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

environmental matters 

a majority of the properties acquired by us were subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

see note 19 in the consolidated financial statements for further information about environmental liabilities

 at december 31 2014 we did not guarantee any thirdparty debt of the coinvestment ventures in our role as the manager we work with the coinvestment ventures to refinance their maturing debt there can be no assurance that the coinvestment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt or at all if the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets certain of the ventures also have credit facilities or unencumbered properties both of which may be used to obtain funds 

contractual obligations 

longterm contractual obligations 

we had longterm contractual obligations at december 31 2014 as follows in millions 

 

  

   

distribution and dividend requirements 

our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure we will meet the dividend requirements of the internal revenue code relative to maintaining our real estate investment trust status while still allowing us to retain cash to meet other needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities 

in 2014 and 2013 we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 033 and 028 per common share respectively our future common stock dividends may vary and will be determined by our board of directors upon the circumstances prevailing at the time including our financial condition operating results and real estate investment trust distribution requirements and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board of directors during the year 

at december 31 2014 we had one series of preferred stock outstanding – series q the annual dividend rate is 854 per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears 

pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock 

other commitments 

on a continuing basis we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition andor disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties 

critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity’s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management generally the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance of the accounting policies discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies 

consolidation 

we consolidate all entities that are whollyowned and those in which we own less than 100 of the equity but control as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity investments in entities that we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method our ability to correctly assess our influence andor control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in the consolidated financial statements 

business combinations 

upon acquisition of real estate that constitutes a business which includes acquiring a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component the components typically include land building debt intangible assets related to above and below market leases value of costs to obtain tenants deferred tax liability and other assumed assets and liabilities in the case of an acquisition of a business in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often is based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located the fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties in the case of an acquisition of a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting this allocation may result in a gain or a loss the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment which may differ when final information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period not to exceed one year 

capitalization of costs and depreciation 

we capitalize costs incurred in developing renovating rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred during the land development and construction periods we capitalize interest costs insurance real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets 

  

we estimate the depreciable portion of our real estate assets and related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense our ability to estimate the depreciable portions of our real estate assets and useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets any change to the assets to be depreciated and the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized 

revenue recognition – gains on disposition of real estate and strategic capital income 

we recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets generally at the time the title is transferred consideration is received and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold in many of our transactions an entity in which we have an equity investment will acquire a real estate asset from us we make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the entity that acquires the assets in addition we make judgments regarding recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives earned for services provided to these entities based on when they are earned fixed and determinable 

other than temporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated entities 

when circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary if we determine there is a loss in value that is other than temporary we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value the use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value the determination of when a loss is other than temporary and the calculation of the amount of the loss is complex and subjective use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions changes in economic and operating conditions as well as changes in our intent with regard to our investment that occur subsequent to our review could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our equity investments 

derivative financial instruments 

derivatives instruments can be designated as fair value hedges cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that at inception and over the term of the instruments the hedged item and derivative qualify for hedge accounting the rules and interpretations for derivatives are complex failure to apply this guidance correctly may result in all changes in fair value of the derivative being recognized in earnings 

we assess both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures any ineffective portion of a derivative financial instrument’s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings derivatives not designated as hedges are to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and variable interest rates but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements 

see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our derivative financial instrument policy 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to estimate our income tax liability for each taxable entity the liability associated with open tax years that are under review our reit taxable income and our compliance with reit requirements our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws we estimate our actual current income tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities these estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain nonroutine transactions changes due to audit adjustments by federal international and state tax authorities our inability to qualify as a reit the potential for builtin gain recognition changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to taxable reit subsidiaries and changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within income tax expense we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities 

impairment of longlived assets 

we assess the carrying values of our respective longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable 

recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models applying a capitalization rate to estimated noi of a property quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals where considered necessary the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of a real estate property that we expect to hold is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property at the time our intent changes to dispose of one of our real estate properties we compare the carrying value of the property to the estimated proceeds from disposition if there is an impairment we record an impairment for any excess including costs to sell 

  

assumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our longlived assets 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

funds from operations “ffo” 

ffo is a financial measure that is not determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” but is a measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings although the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” has published a definition of ffo modifications to the nareit calculation of ffo are common among real estate investment trusts as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business 

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor do we intend it to present a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance we believe net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap further we believe our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition and our operating performance 

nareit’s ffo measure adjusts net earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales along with impairment charges of previously depreciated properties we agree that these nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

  

 our ffo measures 

at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community” we believe stockholders potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating results are best served by a defined ffo measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareitdefined measure of ffo our ffo measures are used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe that it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses 

we use these ffo measures including by segment and region to i evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv assess our performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general and v evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a longterm outlook we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of shortterm items that we do not expect to affect the underlying longterm performance of the properties the longterm performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income while not infrequent or unusual these additional items we exclude in calculating ffo as defined by prologis  defined below are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative shortterm effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our longterm outlook 

we use our ffo measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance we do not use our ffo measures as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap as indicators of our operating performance as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs 

  

ffo as defined by prologis 

to arrive at ffo as defined by prologis  we adjust the nareitdefined ffo measure to exclude 

 

  

  

  

  

 we calculate ffo as defined by prologis for our unconsolidated entities on the same basis as we calculate our ffo as defined by prologis  

we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy 

core ffo 

in addition to ffo as defined by prologis  we also use core ffo  to arrive at core ffo  we adjust ffo as defined by prologis to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly or our share of these items recognized by our unconsolidated entities to the extent they are included in ffo as defined by prologis  

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe it is appropriate to further adjust our ffo as defined by prologis for certain recurring items as they were driven by transactional activity and factors relating to the financial and real estate markets rather than factors specific to the ongoing operating performance of our properties or investments the impairment charges we have recognized were primarily based on valuations of real estate which had declined due to market conditions that we no longer expected to hold for longterm investment over the last few years we made it a priority to strengthen our financial position by reducing our debt our investment in certain low yielding assets and our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations as a result we changed our intent to sell or contribute certain of our real estate properties and recorded impairment charges when we did not expect to recover the costs of our investment also we purchased portions of our debt securities when we believed it was advantageous to do so which was based on market conditions and in an effort to lower our borrowing costs and extend our debt maturities as a result we have recognized net gains or losses on the early extinguishment of certain debt due to the financial market conditions at that time 

we have also adjusted for some nonrecurring items the merger acquisition and other integration expenses included costs we incurred in 2012 associated with the merger between amb and prologis the acquisition of prologis european properties and the integration of our systems and processes in addition we and our coinvestment ventures make acquisitions of real estate and we believe the costs associated with these transactions are transaction based and not part of our core operations 

we analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental income of our real estate and the revenue driven by our strategic capital business net of operating administrative and financing expenses this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities although these items discussed above have had a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term 

we use core ffo  including by segment and region to i evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our 

  

expected operating performance v assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general and vi evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a longterm outlook we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of items that we do not expect to affect the underlying longterm performance of the properties we own as noted above we believe the longterm performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy 

limitations on use of our ffo measures 

while we believe our defined ffo measures are important supplemental measures neither nareit’s nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are therefore limited as an analytical tool accordingly these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business some of these limitations are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions this information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap to assist investors in compensating for these limitations we reconcile our defined ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap for the years ended december 31 as follows in thousands 

 

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreignexchange related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments see our risk factors in item 1a risk factors specifically the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and we face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business activities including refinancing and interest rate risks which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition if we are unable to make required payments on our debt or are unable to refinance our debt  see also notes 2 and 18 in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information about our foreign operations and derivative financial instruments 

we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in exchange or interest rates at december 31 2014 the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign exchangerelated variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our financial results or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2014 we had net equity of approximately 15 billion or 11 of total net equity denominated in a currency other than the us dollar after consideration of our derivative and nonderivative financial instruments based on our sensitivity analysis a 10 reduction in exchange rates would cause a reduction of 150 million to our net equity 

at december 31 2014 we had foreign currency forward contracts which were designated and qualify as net investment hedges with an aggregate notional amount of 11 billion to hedge a portion of our investments in europe including the united kingdom and japan based on our sensitivity analysis a weakening of the us dollar against each of the euro british pound sterling and japanese yen by 10 would 

  

result in a 105 million negative change in our cash flows upon settlement in addition we also have euro option contracts which were not designated as hedges with an aggregate notional amount of 04 billion to mitigate risk associated with the translation of projected net income of our subsidiaries in europe a weakening of the us dollar against the euro by 10 would result in a 35 million negative change in our cash flows upon settlement 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows at december 31 2014 we had 5727 million of variable rate debt outstanding all of which was on our term loans at december 31 2014 we had entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix 3421 million of our japanese yen term loan during the year ended december 31 2014 we had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of 1816 million on our variable rate credit facilities not subject to interest rate swap agreements based on the results of a sensitivity analysis assuming a 10 adverse change in interest rates based on our average outstanding balances during the period the impact was 05 million which equates to a change in interest rates of 13 basis points

investment strategy 

we believe that growth in gross domestic product “gdp” and in global trade are important drivers of demand for our industrial real estate trade and gdp are correlated as higher levels of investment production and consumption within a globalized economy are consistent with increased levels of imports and exports as the world produces and consumes more we believe that the volume of global trade will continue to increase at a rate in excess of growth in global gdp significant supply chain reconfiguration obsolescence and customers’ preference to lease rather than own industrial real estate also drive demand for high quality distribution space 

our investment strategy focuses on providing distribution and logistics space to customers whose businesses are tied to global trade and depend on the efficient movement of goods through the global supply chain we have a deep global presence with assets under management of 455 billion based on expected investment spanning 21 countries on four continents our properties are primarily located in two main categories global markets and regional markets global markets comprise approximately 30 of the largest markets tied to global trade these markets feature large population centers with high percapita consumption rates and are located near major airports seaports and ground transportation systems regional markets benefit from large population centers but typically are not as tied to the global supply chain but rather serve local consumption and are often less supply constrained we intend to primarily hold only the highest quality classa product in global and regional markets as of december 31 2013 global and regional markets represented approximately 84 and 14 respectively of our overall owned and managed platform based on our share of net operating income of the properties we also own a small number of assets in other markets which account for approximately 2 of our owned and managed platform we generally plan to exit from these other markets in an orderly fashion in the next few years although we may continue to opportunistically invest in other markets we have local market knowledge construction expertise and a commitment to sustainable design across our diverse portfolio we are supported by a broad and diverse customer base comprising relationships with multinational corporations that result in repeatable business 

business strategy and operating segments 

our business strategy includes two operating segments real estate operations and investment management 

real estate operations segment 

rental operations  this represents the primary source of our revenue earnings and funds from operations “ffo” we collect rent from our customers under operating leases including reimbursements for the vast majority of our operating costs we expect to generate longterm internal growth in rental income by maintaining a high occupancy rate at our properties by controlling expenses and through contractual rent increases on existing space and through rent increases on renewals on rollover space thus capitalizing on the economies of scale inherent in owning operating and growing a large global portfolio our rental income is diversified due to both our global presence and our broad customer base we believe that our property management and leasing teams regular maintenance and capital expenditure programs energy management and sustainability programs and risk management programs create cost efficiencies allowing us to leverage our global platform and provide flexible solutions for our customers 

capital deployment  capital deployment includes development redevelopment and acquisition activities that support our rental operations and are therefore included with that line of business for segment reporting we acquire develop and redevelop industrial properties primarily in global and regional markets to meet our customers’ needs within this line of business we capitalize on i the land that we currently own in global and regional markets ii the development expertise of our local personnel iii our global customer relationships and iv the demand for highquality distribution facilities in key markets we seek to increase our rental income and the net asset value of the company through the leasing of newly developed space as well as through the acquisition of new properties depending on several factors we may develop properties for longterm hold for contribution into one of our coinvestment ventures or occasionally for sale to third parties during 2013 we recognized gains in continuing operations of 563 million from the disposition of properties – primarily properties we developed we develop directly as well as with our partners in certain coinvestment ventures 

investment management segment  we invest with partners and investors through our coinvestment ventures both private and public we tailor industrial portfolios to investors’ specific needs and deploy capital with a focus on larger long duration ventures and open ended funds with leading global institutions we also access alternative sources of public equity such as the nippon prologis reit inc “npr” which began trading on the tokyo stock exchange in early 2013 these private and public vehicles source strategic capital for distinct geographies across our global platform we typically hold an ownership interest in these ventures between 1550 we generate investment management revenues from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures by providing asset management and property management services we may earn revenues through additional services provided such as leasing acquisition construction development disposition legal and tax services depending on the structure of the venture and the returns provided to our partners we may also earn revenues through incentive returns or promotes during the life of a venture or upon liquidation we believe our coinvestments with investors will continue to serve as a source of capital for new investments and provide revenues for our stockholders as well as mitigate risk associated with our foreign currency exposure we may grow this business with the formation of new ventures and through the growth in existing ventures with new thirdparty capital and additional investments by us at december 31 2013 we had 13 coinvestment ventures with assets under management consolidated and unconsolidated and approximately 90 of these ventures based on the gross book value of the buildings in these ventures are longlife or perpetual vehicles 

competition 

the existence of competitively priced distribution space available in any market could have a material impact on our ability to rent space and on the rents that we can charge which impacts both of our operating segments to the extent we wish to acquire land for future development 

  

of properties in our real estate operations segment or dispose of land we may compete with local regional and national developers we also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our investment management segment 

we believe we have competitive advantages due to i our ability to respond quickly to customers’ needs for highquality distribution space in key global and regional distribution markets ii our established relationships with key customers served by our local personnel iii our ability to leverage our organizational scale and structure to provide a single point of contact for our global customers through our global customer solutions team iv our property management and leasing expertise v our relationships and proven track record with current and prospective investors in our investment management business vi our global experience in the development and management of industrial properties vii the strategic locations of our land that we expect to develop and viii our personnel who are experienced in the land entitlement process 

customers 

we have a broad customer base that is diverse in terms of industry concentration and represents a broad spectrum of international national regional and local distribution space users at december 31 2013 in our real estate operations segment we had more than 3500 customers occupying 2535 million square feet of distribution space on an owned and managed basis we had more than 4500 customers occupying 5038 million square feet of distribution space our largest customer and 25 largest customers accounted for 16 and 226 respectively of our annualized base rent at december 31 2013 for our real estate operations segment and 18 and 172 respectively for our owned and managed portfolio which includes our real estate operations segment and our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures 

we develop longterm relationships with our customers and understand their business and needs serving as their strategic partner for real estate on a global basis keeping in close contact with customers and focusing on exceptional customer service sets us apart from other real estate providers as much more than a landlord we believe that what we offer in terms of scope scale and quality of assets of our owned and managed portfolio is unique our indepth knowledge of our markets helps us stay ahead of trends and create forwardthinking solutions for their distribution networks this depth of customer knowledge results in greater retention and expanded service which garners additional business from the same customer across multiple geographies in our real estate operations segment over half our annual base rent is derived from customers who lease from us in more than one location and in some cases more than one country which is consistent with our owned and managed portfolio 

in our investment management segment we also consider our partners and investors to be our customers as of december 31 2013 we partnered with 104 investors several of which invest in multiple ventures 

employees 

we employ 1468 persons across the globe our employees work in 4 countries in the americas 873 persons 15 countries in europe 387 persons and 3 countries in asia 208 persons of the total we have assigned 918 employees to our real estate operations segment and 98 employees to our investment management segment we have 452 employees who work in corporate and support positions who are not assigned to a segment we believe our relationships with our employees are good our employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements although some of our employees in europe are represented by statutory works councils and benefit from applicable labor agreements 

code of ethics and business conduct 

we maintain a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to our board of directors “board” and all of our officers and employees including the principal executive officer the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer or persons performing similar functions a copy of our code of ethics and business conduct is available on our website wwwprologiscom in addition to being accessible through our website copies of our code of ethics and business conduct can be obtained free of charge upon written request to investor relations pier 1 bay 1 san francisco california 94111 any amendments to or waivers of our code of ethics and business conduct that apply to the principal executive officer the principal financial officer or the principal accounting officer or persons performing similar functions and that relate to any matter enumerated in item 406b of regulation sk will be disclosed on our website 

environmental matters 

we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition either the previous owners or we have subjected a majority of the properties we have acquired including land to environmental reviews while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see item 1a risk factors and note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

insurance coverage 

we carry insurance coverage on our properties we determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance self 

  

insurance and through a whollyowned captive insurance entity the costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through reimbursements from our customers we believe that our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured see further discussion in item 1a risk factors 




 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations distributable cash flow and value of our securities these risks include among others 

general 

as a global company we are subject to social political and economic risks of doing business in many countries 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states during 2013 we generated approximately 527 million or 301 of our revenue from operations outside the united states circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flow include but are not limited to the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our global growth also subjects us to certain risks including risks associated with funding increasing headcount integrating new offices and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws 

although we have committed substantial resources to expand our global platform if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

in addition our international operations and specifically the ability of our nonunited states subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt may be affected by currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other things 

the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the functional currency at december 31 2013 approximately 73 billion or 295  of our total assets are invested in a currency other than the us dollar primarily the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen as a result we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our financial position debt covenant ratios results of operations and cash flow although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and using derivative contracts there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful 

  

hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency the funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of foreign currency the failure to hedge effectively against exchange rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

to the extent there is turmoil in the financial markets it has the potential to materially affect the value of our properties and investments in our unconsolidated entities the availability or the terms of financing that we and our unconsolidated entities have or may anticipate utilizing our ability and that of our unconsolidated entities to make principal and interest payments on or refinance any outstanding debt when due and may impact the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases 

any additional continued or recurring disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

risks related to our business 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets which may reduce economic returns to investors 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions in addition significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as secured mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments like other companies qualifying as reits under the internal revenue code we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable reit subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property while we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment in order to generate liquidity if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale we may not pursue such sales 

in the event that we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation divesting ourselves of properties whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term at less than optimal terms incurring debt entering into leases with our customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates at turnover there can be no assurance however that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us additionally taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results 

we are exposed to general economic conditions local regional national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties 

as of december 31 2013 approximately 326 of our consolidated operating properties or 58 billion based on investment before depreciation are located in california which represented 244 of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 291 of our annualized base rent our revenue from and the value of our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california’s economic climate because of the number of properties we have located in california a downturn in california’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

in addition to california we also have significant holdings defined as more than 3 of total investment before depreciation in operating properties in certain global and regional markets located in central  eastern pennsylvania chicago dallasfort worth japan mexico new jerseynew york city and south florida our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties conditions such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space among other factors may impact operating conditions any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction in demand for distribution space could adversely affect our results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of our securities 

in addition the unconsolidated entities in which we invest have concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above as well as in markets in france germany the netherlands poland and the united kingdom and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets 

a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity united states properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the san francisco bay area los angeles and seattle international properties located in active seismic 

  

areas include japan and mexico we generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to self insure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis we have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for our assets in japan based on this analysis 

further a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane andor flood risk we carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants 

our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses 

we and our unconsolidated entities currently carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy namely windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets we believe our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated entities are adequately insured however there are certain losses including losses from floods earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property 

furthermore we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and if there is recourse debt then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business 

investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio market research and our property management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated some of the factors that may affect real estate values include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our investments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector 

our investments in real estate assets are primarily concentrated in the industrial distribution sector this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified 

our operating results and distributable cash flow will depend on the continued generation of lease revenues from customers and we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or release space on favorable terms as leases expire 

our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations we are also subject to the risk that upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties leases may not be renewed by existing customers the space may not be released to new customers or the terms of renewal or releasing including the cost of 

  

required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers we may lose potential customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain customers when our customers’ leases expire in the event of default by a significant number of customers we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord and may be unable to release spaces a customer may experience a downturn in its business which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease in addition a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow 

we may acquire properties which involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results and the value of our securities 

we may acquire industrial properties the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates when we acquire properties we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures additionally there is and it is expected there will continue to be significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities 

our real estate development strategies may not be successful 

our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through sales to third parties development of industrial properties to hold for longterm investment or contribution or sale to an unconsolidated entity depending on market conditions our liquidity needs and other factors we may expand investment in our development renovation and redevelopment business and we will complete the buildout and leasing of our development platform we may also develop renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed development coinvestment ventures the real estate development renovation and redevelopment business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities which include the following risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our operating results financial condition and cash flow 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination 

  

environmental laws in some countries including the united states also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of our properties are known to contain asbestoscontaining building materials 

in addition some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances further certain of our properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in connection with certain divested properties we have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties 

we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the presence of such substances on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow 

if we decide to contribute or sell properties to an unconsolidated entity or third parties to generate proceeds we may not be successful 

we may contribute or sell properties to certain of our unconsolidated entities or third parties on a casebycase basis our ability to sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties market conditions including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties and other factors beyond our control if our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets andor at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or on favorable terms or at all the unconsolidated entity or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital in the private and public markets in order to acquire properties from us should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then dispositions could be delayed if we are unable to generate proceeds through property sales we may have to delay our deleveraging plans which may result in adverse effects on our liquidity distributable cash flow debt covenants and the market price of our securities 

we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming coinvestment ventures investing in new or existing coinvestment ventures attracting third party investment and investing in and managing properties through coinvestment ventures 

as of december 31 2013 we had an investment in real estate containing approximately 270 million square feet held through unconsolidated entities our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in unconsolidated entities and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through coinvestment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances however there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new coinvestment ventures attract third party investment or make additional investments in new or existing coinvestment ventures successfully develop or acquire properties through unconsolidated entities or realize value from such unconsolidated entities our inability to do so may have an adverse effect on our growth our earnings and the market price of our securities 

our partners in our unconsolidated investments may share certain approval rights over major decisions and some partners may manage the properties in the unconsolidated entities our unconsolidated investments involve certain risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

 we generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our unconsolidated entities to permit us to achieve our business objectives however we may not be able to do so we have formed publicly traded investment vehicles like our publicly traded reit in japan for which we serve as sponsor andor manager we have contributed and may continue to contribute assets into such vehicles as with any of our publicly traded entities or funds there is a risk that our managerial relationship may be terminated 

  

the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have acquired and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties then we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it which could adversely affect our cash flow 

risks related to financing and capital 

we face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business activities including refinancing and interest rate risks and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to make required payments on our debt or are unable to refinance our debt 

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected and if the maturing debt is secured the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness our global senior credit facility japanese yenbased credit agreement and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements from time to time we may enter into interest rate swap or cap agreements such hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements the funds required to settle any swap breakage arrangements if any could be significant depending on the size of underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of breakage the failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position in addition our unconsolidated entities may be unable to refinance indebtedness or meet payment obligations which may impact our distributable cash flow and our financial condition andor we may be required to recognize impairment charges of our investments 

covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition 

the terms of our various credit agreements including our global senior credit facility and japanese yenbased credit agreement the indentures under which our senior notes are issued and other note agreements require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage leverage ratios fixed charge ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness if we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition could be adversely affected 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity 

the credit ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing also a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our refinancing and other capital market activities our ability to manage debt maturities our future growth our financial condition the market price of our securities and our development and acquisition activity 

we are dependent on external sources of capital  

in order to qualify as a reit we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain and we may be subject to tax to the extent our income is not fully distributed while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances our own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december 31 2013 and in some cases declared as late as december 31 2014 the reit can satisfy up to 90 of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital further in order to maintain our reit status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or 

  

amortization payments our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities 

our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock 

any additional future issuance of common stock will reduce the percentage of our common stock owned by investors in most circumstances stockholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock in addition depending on the terms and pricing of an additional offering of our common stock and the value of the properties our stockholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock 

federal income tax risks 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences 

we elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code commencing with the taxable year ended december 31 1997 we believe we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit however it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a reit or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex sections of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control for example in order to qualify as a reit prologis must derive at least 95 of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis the provisions of the internal revenue code and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a reit are more complicated in our case because we hold assets through the operating partnership 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on taxable income at regular corporate rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification if we lost our reit status our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved 

furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit gross income tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to united states federal income tax in addition a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties including by contributing properties to our coinvestment ventures under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions while we believe that the internal revenue service would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue code were to argue successfully that a transfer disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 

legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax taws applicable to investments in reits and similar entities additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders 

other risks 

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees from time to time our personnel and their roles may change in connection with the completion of the merger there were changes to our personnel and their roles while we believe that we have retained 

  

our key talent and have found suitable employees to meet our personnel needs the loss of key personnel any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market price of our securities if we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs 

under the americans with disabilities act places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants if we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the americans with disabilities act including removing access barriers then our cash flow and the amounts available to make distributions and payments to our security holders may be adversely affected our properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and lifesafety requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements while we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations restatements of our financial statements a decline in the price of our securities or otherwise materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate change related risks 

we consider that we are exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate our distribution facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events such as severe storms andor floods if the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change our exposure to these events could increase 

we do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change as our operations do not emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases however we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain andor stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report and the matters described under item 1a risk factors 

  

management’s overview 

we believe the scale and quality of our operating platform the skills of our team and the strength of our balance sheet will provide us with unique competitive advantages going forward we have a straightforward plan for growth that is based on the following three key elements 

 

  

  

 we believe these three strategies will enable us to generate growth in revenue earnings net operating income core ffo and dividends for our shareholders in the coming years 

since the merger we were focused on the following priorities “the ten quarter plan” which we completed june 30 2013 

 

  

 we have reduced our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations by borrowing in local currencies where appropriate utilizing derivative contracts to hedge our foreign denominated equity as well as through holding assets outside the united states primarily in our coinvestment ventures as of december 31 2013 we increased our share of net equity denominated in us dollars to 77 from 45 at the time of the merger we expect our percentage of us dollar denominated net equity to increase further in 2014

 operational outlook 

the recovery of the logistics real estate market further strengthened and broadened globally during 2013 operating fundamentals continued to improve and we believe this trend will continue as the leading indicators of industrial real estate are strong global trade is expected to grow 49 in 2014 and 54 in 2015  a  based on our own internal surveys space utilization in our facilities continues to trend higher which means our customers are short on capacity to handle their current needs and their future growth 

market conditions in the us are very favorable and an ongoing supply and demand imbalance exists  b  the industrial market absorbed 233 million square feet in 2013 the highest level since 2005  b  by contrast development completions amounted to only 67 million square feet resulting in a demand imbalance of 166 million square feet the highest on record  b  these conditions have driven us market vacancy to a new record low of 72  b  as customer demand remains active and supply pipelines are below historical norm we expect vacancy to continue to decline and rental rates to continue to increase in 2014 

operating conditions in our latin american markets are positive and have outperformed uneven macroeconomic growth in 2013 in mexico demand has continued to recover and the market occupancy rate across the six largest logistics markets mexico city monterrey 

  

guadalajara juarez reynosa and tijuana was 916 at the end of 2013 up 100 basis points from the prior year based on internally generated data in brazil despite a slowing economy we believe it is an underserved logistics market and there is strong demand for modern logistics facilities as companies serve the growing consumer market 

in europe we believe we have seen the end of recessionary conditions in most countries customer sentiment continues to improve and broaden which is translating into meaningful demand evidence for this includes paneuropean market occupancy of 913 higher than the level achieved in 2007  c  the occupancy rate rose 10 in 2013 and we expect further gains in 2014 economic momentum turned positive in 2013 and brighter macroeconomic prospects appear to be generating demand for logistics facilities in our view our research indicates new starts for speculative development are near historic low levels we expect net effective rents to continue to increase and the recovery to broaden to more of our markets we believe high occupancy and rent growth combined with declining capitalization rates will lead to a strong recovery in european industrial real estate values 

expansionary market conditions are evident in our asian markets the availability of classa distribution space remains highly constrained and net effective rents are rising in japan vacancy rates remain below 3  a  and there is upward pressure on rents especially in tokyo and osaka as these markets have absorbed new deliveries increasing development costs driven by higher land and construction pricing are expected to keep new supply in balance demand in china is accelerating and we see new requirements from retailers and ecommerce customers low vacancy conditions continue to lead to outsized rental rate growth in our view land availability has been constrained but appears to be improving barriers to supply continue to drive rents ahead of inflation and we believe that we are well positioned with our development platform to meet this accelerating demand 

we believe elevated occupancy rates across our markets coupled with the stillgradual pickup in new construction starts are leading to notable increases in replacementcost rents and effective rents we expect to use our strategic land positions to support increased development activity in this environment our development business comprises speculative development buildtosuit development valueadded conversions and redevelopment we will develop directly and within our coinvestment ventures depending on location market conditions submarkets or building sites and availability of capital 

 

 

  

  

 results of operations 

real estate operations segment 

the rental income and rental expense we recognize is directly impacted by our consolidated operating portfolio as mentioned earlier we have had significant real estate activity during the last several years that has impacted the size of our portfolio in addition the operating fundamentals in our markets have been improving which has impacted both the occupancy and rental rates we have experienced as well as fueling development activity also included in this segment is revenue from land we own and lease to customers under ground leases and development management and other income offset by acquisition disposition and land holding costs the results of properties sold to third parties have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented net operating income from the real estate operations segment for the years ended december 31 was as follows dollars in thousands 

 

 detail of our consolidated operating properties as of december 31 was as follows square feet in thousands 

 

 below are the key drivers that have influenced the net operating income “noi” of this segment 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 investment management segment 

the net operating income from the investment management segment representing fees and incentives earned for services performed reduced by investment management expenses direct costs of managing these entities and the properties they own for the years ended december 31 was as follows dollars in thousands 

 

   

we had the following unconsolidated coinvestment ventures under management as of december 31 square feet and gross book value in thousands 

 

 investment management income fluctuates due to the number and size of coinvestment ventures that are under management as noted earlier we have formed some new ventures and we have acquired the controlling interest in several coinvestment ventures which results in us owning the properties and reporting them in our consolidated results in addition the merger resulted in the addition of several ventures during 2011 

the direct costs associated with our investment management segment totaled 893 million 638 million and 550 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively and are included in the line item investment management expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in item 8 these expenses include the direct expenses associated with the asset management of the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures provided by our employees who are assigned to our investment management segment in addition in order to achieve efficiencies and economies of scale all of our property management functions are provided by a team of professionals who are assigned to our real estate operations segment these individuals perform the propertylevel management of the properties in our owned and managed portfolio including properties we consolidate and the properties we manage that are owned by the unconsolidated entities we allocate the costs of our property management function to the properties we consolidate reported in rental expenses  and the properties owned by the unconsolidated entities included in investment management expenses  by using the square feet owned by the respective portfolios the increase in investment management expenses in 2013 was due to the addition of pelp and npr and additional expense related to the incentive returns we recognized in 2013 offset somewhat by the conclusion of several ventures the increase in investment management expenses in 2012 was due to the increased investment management platform and infrastructure that was part of the merger offset partially with a decline due to the consolidation of pepr in june 2011 and the acquisition of three of our coinvestment ventures in 2012 prologis north american industrial fund ii prologis california and prologis north american fund 1 collectively the “2012 coinvestment venture acquisitions” 

we expect the net operating income of this segment to increase in 2014 due to npr and pelp and the increased size of the existing ventures through acquisitions from us and third parties as well as increased incentive returns 

see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on our unconsolidated entities 

other components of income 

general and administrative “ga” expenses 

ga expenses for the years ended december 31 consisted of the following in thousands 

 

   

the increase in ga expenses and the various components from 2012 to 2013 was principally due to increased infrastructure to accommodate our growing business in 2013 the gross book value for our owned and managed portfolio increased 14 billion to 455 billion at december 31 2013 as discussed above we allocate a portion of our ga expenses that relate to property management functions to our real estate operations segment and our investment management segment 

the increase in ga expenses and the various components from 2011 to 2012 was due principally to the larger infrastructure associated with the combined company following the merger and the pepr acquisition 

we capitalize certain costs directly related to our development and leasing activities capitalized ga expenses included salaries and related costs as well as other general and administrative costs the capitalized ga costs for the years ended december 31 were as follows in thousands 

 

 for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 the capitalized salaries and related costs represented 237 203 and 200 respectively of our total salaries and related costs salaries and related costs are comprised primarily of wages other compensation and employeerelated expenses 

our development activity has increased over the last three years and therefore our capitalized costs have increased we began consolidated development projects with a total expected investment of 14 billion 13 billion nearly half of which was started in the fourth quarter and 08 billion during 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization was 6487 million 7243 million and 5424 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease from 2012 to 2013 is primarily due to less depreciation as a result of contributions of properties offset slightly by additional depreciation and amortization from completed and leased development properties and increased leasing activity the increase from 2011 to 2012 is due to additional depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the assets including intangible assets acquired in the merger and pepr acquisition during the second quarter of 2011 and the 2012 coinvestment venture acquisitions as well as completed and leased development properties and additional leasing and capital improvements in our operating properties 

merger acquisition and other integration expenses 

we incurred significant transaction integration and transitional costs related to the merger and pepr acquisition during 2011 and 2012 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more detail on these expenses 

impairment of real estate properties 

during 2012 and 2011 we recognized impairment charges of real estate properties in continuing operations of 2529 million and 212 million respectively due to our change of intent to no longer hold these assets for longterm investment in 2012 these impairment charges related to our planned contribution of properties to pelp 1353 million land parcels that we expected to sell to third parties 889 million and operating buildings we expected to contribute or sell 287 million see notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more detail on the process we took to value these assets and the related impairment charges recognized 

earnings from unconsolidated entities net 

we recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities of 972 million 317 million and 599 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the earnings we recognize are impacted by i variances in revenues and expenses of the entity ii the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by the entity iii our ownership interest in the entity and iv fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to us dollars if applicable we manage the majority of the properties in which we have an ownership interest as part of our total owned and managed portfolio we have had significant changes in the coinvestment ventures in which we have an ownership interest that has impacted the earnings we recognized see discussion of our coinvestment ventures above in the investment management segment discussion and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized 

  

interest expense 

interest expense from continuing operations included the following components in thousands for the years ended december 31 

 

 gross interest expense decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower debt levels in 2013 we decreased our debt by 28 billion to 90 billion at december 31 2013 

gross interest expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher debt levels as a result of the merger the pepr acquisition and the 2012 coinvestment venture acquisitions offset slightly by lower effective borrowing costs 

our weighted average effective interest rate was 47 46 and 56 for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively during 2012 and 2013 we issued new debt with lower borrowing costs and used the proceeds to pay down or buy back our higher cost debt resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of 42 as of december 31 2013 

our future interest expense both gross interest and the portion capitalized will vary depending on among other things our effective borrowing rate and the level of our development activities 

see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 and liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs 

gains on acquisitions and dispositions of investments in real estate net 

in 2013 we recognized net gains on acquisitions and dispositions of investments in real estate in continuing operations of 5977 million primarily related to contributions of operating properties to our unconsolidated entities we received proceeds of 67 billion from the contribution of 254 properties aggregating 715 million square feet 

in 2012 we recognized net gains on acquisitions and dispositions of investments in real estate in continuing operations of 3056 million which included 2942 million of gains related to three 2012 coinvestment ventures we acquired the contributions of operating properties to our unconsolidated entities in 2012 resulted in cash proceeds of 3819 million and net gains of 114 million 

during 2011 we recognized net gains on acquisitions and dispositions of investments in real estate in continuing operations of 1117 million this included gains recognized in the second quarter related to the pepr acquisition 859 million and the acquisition of our partner’s interest in one of our other unconsolidated ventures in japan 135 million the contributions of operating properties to our unconsolidated entities in 2011 resulted in cash proceeds of 5908 million and net gains of 123 million 

if we realize a gain on contribution of a property to an unconsolidated entity we recognize the portion attributable to the third party ownership in the entity if we realize a loss on contribution we recognize the full amount as soon as it is known due to our continuing involvement through our ownership in the unconsolidated entity these dispositions are not included in discontinued operations

we and certain of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries may have intercompany or third party debt that is not denominated in the entity’s functional currency when the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity a gain or loss may result to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate certain of our third party and intercompany debt is remeasured with the resulting adjustment recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in foreign currency translation loss net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss this treatment is applicable to third party debt that is designated as a hedge of our net investment and intercompany debt that is deemed to be longterm in nature 

if the intercompany debt is deemed shortterm in nature when the debt is remeasured we recognize a gain or loss in earnings we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of 92 million and 74 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively and losses of 59 million in 2011 related to the settlement and remeasurement of debt predominantly the gains or losses recognized in earnings relate to the remeasurement of intercompany loans between the united states parent and certain consolidated subsidiaries in japan and europe and result from fluctuations in the exchange rates of us dollar to the euro japanese yen and british pound sterling in addition we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of 06 million and 56 million and gains of 21 million from the settlement of transactions with third parties in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

we recognized unrealized losses of 422 million which included an adjustment to the amortization of a discount associated with a derivative instrument in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 223 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively and an unrealized gain of 450 million in 2011 on the derivative instrument exchange feature related to our exchangeable senior notes which became exchangeable at the time of the merger 

  

gains losses on early extinguishment of debt net 

during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 we purchased portions of several series of senior notes senior exchangeable notes and extinguished some secured mortgage debt prior to maturity which resulted in the recognition of losses of 2770 million and 141 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively and gains of 03 million in 2011 the gains or losses represent the difference between the recorded debt net of premiums and discounts and including related debt issuance costs and the consideration we paid to retire the debt including fees included in this amount in 2012 are losses that were included in other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss in item 8 related to hedge transactions and were deemed unrecoverable in the fourth quarter of 2012 these hedges were associated with debt that was repaid before maturity with the proceeds from the contributions to pelp in early 2013 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information regarding our debt repurchases 

impairment of other assets 

we recorded impairment charges in 2011 of 1264 million on certain of our investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities notes receivable and other assets as we believed the decline in fair value to be other than temporary or we did not believe these amounts to be recoverable based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows associated with these assets including estimated sales proceeds 

see notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information on our process with regard to analyzing the recoverability of other assets 

income tax benefit expense 

during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 our current income tax expense was 1262 million 179 million and 216 million we recognize current income tax expense for income taxes incurred by our taxable reit subsidiaries and in certain foreign jurisdictions as well as certain state taxes we also include in current income tax expense the interest associated with our liability for uncertain tax positions our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income and changes in tax and interest rates the majority of the current income tax expense in 2013 relates to asset sales and contributions of certain properties that were held in foreign entities or taxable reit subsidiaries 

in 2013 2012 and 2011 we recognized a net deferred tax benefit of 194 million 143 million and 198 million respectively deferred income tax expense is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries operating in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions 

our income taxes are discussed in more detail in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

discontinued operations 

earnings from discontinued operations were 1235 million 759 million and 1170 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively discontinued operations represent the results of operations of properties that have been sold to third parties or that are held for sale for all periods presented along with the related gain or loss on sale the results of operations that have been classified as discontinued operations are reported separately in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

see notes 4 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further details on what is reported as discontinued operations 

other comprehensive income loss – foreign currency translation losses net 

for our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar we translate their financial statements into us dollars at the time we consolidate those subsidiaries’ financial statements generally assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments due to the fluctuations in exchange rates from the beginning of the period to the end of the period are included in foreign currency translation losses net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss in item 8 

during 2013 we recorded unrealized losses of 2347 million related to foreign currency translations of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars upon consolidation this included approximately 190 million of foreign currency translation losses on the properties contributed to pelp and npr due to the weakening of the euro and japanese yen respectively to the us dollar from december 31 2012 through the date of the contributions in addition we recorded net unrealized losses in 2013 due to the weakening of the japanese yen to the us dollar during 2012 we recorded unrealized net losses of 790 million as the japanese yen weakened relative to the us dollar by 101 from december 31 2011 to december 31 2012 offset slightly by the euro and british pound sterling slightly strengthening against the us dollar during the same period during 2011 we recorded unrealized net losses of 1926 million as the euro and british pound sterling remained relatively flat from december 31 2010 to december 31 2011 but both weakened relative to the us dollar from the merger and pepr acquisition date to december 31 2011 these losses were offset slightly by the strengthening of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar during 2011 

  

portfolio information 

our total owned and managed portfolio includes operating industrial properties and does not include properties under development or properties held for sale and was as follows as of december 31 square feet in thousands 

 

 same store analysis 

we evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures we include properties from our consolidated portfolio and properties owned by the coinvestment ventures accounted for on the equity method that are managed by us referred to as “unconsolidated entities” in our same store analysis we have defined the same store portfolio for the three months ended december 31 2013 as those properties that were in operation at january 1 2012 and have been in operation throughout the same threemonth periods in both 2013 and 2012 we have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party or were classified as held for sale from the population for both periods we believe the factors that impact rental income rental expenses and net operating income in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total portfolio in order to derive an appropriate measure of periodtoperiod operating performance we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the current exchange rate to translate from local currency into us dollars for both periods the same store portfolio for the three months ended december 31 2013 included 4898 million of aggregated square feet 

the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental income rental expenses and net operating income calculated as rental income and recoveries less rental expenses for the full year as included in the consolidated statements of operations in item 8 to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended december 31 dollars in thousands 

 

   

  

  

  

  

   

 environmental matters 

a majority of the properties acquired by us were subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we record a liability for the estimated costs of environmental remediation to be incurred in connection with certain operating properties we acquire as well as certain land parcels we acquire in connection with the planned development of the land the liability is established to cover the environmental remediation costs including cleanup costs consulting fees for studies and investigations monitoring costs and legal costs relating to cleanup litigation defense and the pursuit of responsible third parties we purchase various environmental insurance policies to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources

equity commitments related to certain coinvestment ventures 

certain coinvestment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash we may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash the venture may obtain financing for the properties and therefore the equity commitment may be less than the acquisition price of the real estate depending on market conditions the investment objectives of the ventures our liquidity needs and other factors we may make contributions of properties to these ventures through the remaining commitment period and we may make additional cash investments in these ventures 

the following table is a summary of remaining equity commitments as of december 31 2013 in millions

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

unconsolidated coinvestment ventures debt 

we had investments in and advances to certain unconsolidated coinvestment ventures at december 31 2013 of 43 billion these unconsolidated ventures had total third party debt of 77 billion in the aggregate not our proportionate share at december 31 2013 this debt is primarily secured or collateralized by properties within the venture and is nonrecourse to prologis or the other investors in the coinvestment ventures and matures as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

  

  

   

contractual obligations 

longterm contractual obligations 

we had longterm contractual obligations at december 31 2013 as follows in millions 

 

  

  

 other commitments 

on a continuing basis we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition andor disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties 

distribution and dividend requirements 

our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure we will meet the dividend requirements of the internal revenue code relative to maintaining our reit status while still allowing us to retain cash to meet other needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities 

in 2013 and 2012 we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 028 per common share our future common stock dividends may vary and will be determined by our board upon the circumstances prevailing at the time including our financial condition operating results and reit distribution requirements and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year 

at december 31 2013 we had one series of preferred stock outstanding the series q the annual dividend rate is 854 per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears 

pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock 

critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity’s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management generally the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance of the accounting policies discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies 

impairment of longlived assets 

we assess the carrying values of our respective longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable 

recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to 

  

holding or disposing of the asset our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property quoted market values and third party appraisals where considered necessary the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of a real estate property that we expect to hold is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property at the time our intent changes to dispose of one of our real estate properties we compare the carrying value of the property to the estimated proceeds from disposition if there is an impairment we record an impairment for any excess including costs to sell 

assumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our longlived assets 

other than temporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated entities 

when circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary if we determine there is a loss in value that is other than temporary we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value the use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value the determination of when a loss is other than temporary and the calculation of the amount of the loss is complex and subjective use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions changes in economic and operating conditions as well as changes in our intent with regard to our investment that occur subsequent to our review could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our equity investments 

revenue recognition – gains on disposition of real estate 

we recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets generally at the time the title is transferred consideration is received and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold in many of our transactions an entity in which we have an ownership interest will acquire a real estate asset from us we make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the entity that acquires the assets we also make judgments regarding recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives earned for services provided to these entities based on when they are earned fixed and determinable 

business combinations 

we acquire individual properties as well as portfolios of properties or businesses we may also acquire a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting when we acquire a business or individual operating properties with the intention to hold the investment for the longterm we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component the components typically include land building debt intangible assets related to above and below market leases value of costs to obtain tenants deferred tax liabilities and other assumed assets and liabilities in the case of an acquisition of a business in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often times is based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located the fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties in the case of an acquisition of a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting this allocation may result in a gain or a loss the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment which may differ when final information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period which typically does not exceed one year 

consolidation 

we consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100 but control as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity investments in entities in which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method investments in entities that we do not control and over which we do not exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as appropriate our ability to correctly assess our influence andor control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements 

capitalization of costs and depreciation 

we capitalize costs incurred in developing renovating rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred during the land development and construction periods we capitalize interest costs insurance real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use 

  

capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets we also capitalize costs incurred to successfully originate a lease that result directly from and are essential to the acquisition of that lease leasing costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are presented as a component of other assets 

we estimate the depreciable portion of our real estate assets and related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense our ability to estimate the depreciable portions of our real estate assets and useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets any change to the assets to be depreciated and the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to estimate our income tax liability the liability associated with open tax years that are under review and our compliance with reit requirements our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws we estimate our actual current income tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities these estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain nonroutine transactions changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities our inability to qualify as a reit the potential for builtingain recognition changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to taxable reit subsidiaries and changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within income tax expense we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is “morelikelythannot” that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities 

derivative financial instruments 

all derivatives are recognized at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets within the line items other assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses  as applicable we do not net our derivative position by counterparty for purposes of balance sheet presentation and disclosure the accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives are designated as and qualify as hedging instruments derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

for derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments in accordance with the accounting standards we formally designate and document at inception the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction in addition we formally assess both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures any ineffective portion of a derivative financial instrument’s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and may be used to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and variable interest rates but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements 

changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures hedged fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments will generally be offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged the changes in fair values of derivatives that were not designated andor did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings for cash flow hedges we reclassify changes in the fair value of derivatives into the applicable line item in the consolidated statements of operations in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period that the underlying hedged items affect earnings 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

funds from operations “ffo” 

ffo is a nongaap measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings although the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” has published a definition of ffo modifications to the nareit calculation of ffo are common among reits as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business 

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor do we intend it to present a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance we believe net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap further we believe our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition and our operating performance 

  

nareit’s ffo measure adjusts net earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales along with impairment charges of previously depreciated properties we agree that these nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

  

 our ffo measures 

at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community” we believe stockholders potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating results are best served by a defined ffo measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of ffo our ffo measures are used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe that it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses 

we use these ffo measures including by segment and region to i evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv assess our performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general and v evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a longterm outlook we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of shortterm items that we do not expect to affect the underlying longterm performance of the properties the longterm performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income while not infrequent or unusual these additional items we exclude in calculating ffo as defined by prologis  are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative shortterm effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our longterm outlook 

we use our ffo measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance we do not use our ffo measures as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap as indicators of our operating performance as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs 

ffo as defined by prologis 

to arrive at ffo as defined by prologis  we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude 

 

  

  

  

  

 we calculate ffo as defined by prologis for our unconsolidated entities on the same basis as we calculate our ffo as defined by prologis  

we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy 

  

core ffo 

in addition to ffo as defined by prologis we also use core ffo to arrive at core ffo we adjust ffo as defined by prologis  to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly or our share of these items recognized by our unconsolidated entities to the extent they are included in ffo as defined by prologis  

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe it is appropriate to further adjust our ffo as defined by prologis for certain recurring items as they were driven by transactional activity and factors relating to the financial and real estate markets rather than factors specific to the ongoing operating performance of our properties or investments the impairment charges we have recognized were primarily based on valuations of real estate which had declined due to market conditions that we no longer expected to hold for longterm investment over the last few years we made it a priority to strengthen our financial position by reducing our debt our investment in certain low yielding assets and our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations as a result we changed our intent to sell or contribute certain of our real estate properties and recorded impairment charges when we did not expect to recover the cost of our investment also we have purchased portions of our debt securities when we believed it was advantageous to do so which was based on market conditions and in an effort to lower our borrowing costs and extend our debt maturities as a result we have recognized net gains or losses on the early extinguishment of certain debt due to the financial market conditions at that time 

we have also adjusted for some nonrecurring items the merger acquisition and other integration expenses included costs we incurred in 2011 and 2012 associated with the merger with amb and prologis and the pepr acquisition and the integration of our systems and processes in addition we and our coinvestment ventures make acquisitions of real estate and we believe the costs associated with these transactions are transaction based and not part of our core operations 

we analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental income of our real estate and the revenue driven by our investment management business net of operating administrative and financing expenses this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities as a result although these items have had a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the longterm 

we use core ffo  including by segment and region to i evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance v assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general and vi evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a longterm outlook we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of items that we do not expect to affect the underlying longterm performance of the properties we own as noted above we believe the longterm performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy 

limitations on use of our ffo measures 

while we believe our defined ffo measures are important supplemental measures neither nareit’s nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are therefore limited as an analytical tool accordingly these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business some of these limitations are 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions this information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap to assist investors in compensating for these limitations we reconcile our defined ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap for the years ended december 31 as follows in thousands 

 

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreignexchange related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments we have used certain derivative financial instruments primarily foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our foreign currency market risk as we deem appropriate we have also used interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate market risk we do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with established policies and procedures 

we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in interest rates at december 31 2013 the results of the sensitivity analysis are 

  

summarized below the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates the failure to hedge effectively against exchange and interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates to the translation of the net income and net investment of our foreign entities into us dollar principally euro british pound sterling and japanese yen especially to the extent we wish to repatriate funds to the united states we also have some exposure to movements in exchange rates related to certain intercompany loans we issue from time to time to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate we also may use foreign currency forward contracts or other forms of hedging instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the projected net operating income or net equity of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated entities hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency the funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of foreign currency the failure to hedge effectively against exchange and interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we may experience fluctuations in our earnings as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

in 2013 we entered into seven foreign currency forward contracts that expire in june 2017 and june 2018 with an aggregate notional amount of €5999 million 8000 million using the forward rate of 133 to hedge a portion of our investment in europe at a fixed euro rate in us dollars we also entered into three foreign currency forward contracts that expire in june 2018 with an aggregate notional amount of ¥241 billion 2500 million using the forward rate of 9654 to hedge a portion of our investment in japan at a fixed yen rate in us dollars based on a sensitivity analysis a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against the euro and japanese yen by 10 would result in a 1050 million positive or negative change respectively in our cash flows upon settlement of the forward contracts these derivatives were designated and qualify as hedging instruments and therefore the changes in fair value of these derivatives will be recorded in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets in item 8 

we issued €700 million 9505 million of debt during december 2013 this debt was issued by the operating partnership which is a us dollar functional entity to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro we designated the debt as a nonderivative financial instrument hedge and as a result the change in the value of this debt upon translation into us dollars is recorded in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets in item 8 to offset the foreign currency fluctuations related to our investment in europe 

we may enter into similar agreements in the future to further hedge our investments in europe japan or other regions outside the united states as of december 31 2013 taking into account the net investment hedges approximately 77 of our net equity was denominated in us dollars 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to achieve this objective we primarily borrow on a fixed rate basis for longerterm debt issuances as of december 31 2013 we had a total of 14 billion of variable rate debt outstanding of which 7255 million was outstanding on our credit facilities 5359 million was outstanding under a multicurrency senior term loan and 960 million was outstanding secured mortgage debt as of december 31 2013 we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix 710 million of our variable rate secured mortgage debt 

our primary interest rate risk not subject to interest rate swap agreements is created by the variable rate credit facilities senior term loan and certain secured mortgage debt during the year ended december 31 2013 we had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of 14 billion on our variable rate debt not subject to interest rate swap agreements based on the results of a sensitivity analysis assuming a 10 adverse change in interest rates based on our average outstanding balances during the period the impact was 22 million which equates to a change in interest rates of 16 basis points

investment strategy 

we believe that gross domestic product “gdp” growth and growth in global trade are important drivers of demand for our product trade and gdp are correlated as higher levels of investment production and consumption within a globalized economy are consistent with increased levels of imports and exports as the world produces and consumes more we believe that the volume of global trade will continue to increase at a rate in excess of growth in global gdp significant supply chain reconfiguration obsolescence and customers’ preference to lease rather than own facilities also drive demand for quality distribution space 

our investment strategy focuses on providing distribution and logistics space to customers whose businesses are tied to global trade and depend on the efficient movement of goods through the global supply chain to support global trade we have a deep global presence with assets under management of 431 billion spanning 21 countries on four continents our properties are primarily located in two main market categories global markets and regional markets global markets comprise approximately 30 of the largest markets tied to global trade these markets feature large population centers with high percapita consumption rates and are located near major airports seaports and ground transportation systems similar to global markets regional markets benefit from large population centers but typically are not as tied to the global supply chain and are often less supply constrained we intend to primarily hold only the highest quality classa product in global and regional markets as of december 31 2012 global and regional markets represented approximately 83 and 12 respectively of our overall owned and managed platform based on our share of net operating income of the properties we also own a small number of assets in other markets which account for approximately 5 of our owned and managed platform and from which we generally plan to exit from in an orderly fashion in the next few years although we may continue to opportunistically invest in other markets our portfolio allows us to have local market knowledge construction expertise and a commitment to sustainable design we are supported by a broad and diverse customer base comprising relationships with multinational corporations that result in repeatable business 

business strategy 

our business strategy includes two operating segments real estate operations and private capital we generate revenue earnings net operating income calculated as rental income less rental expenses funds from operations or ffo as defined in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and cash flows through our segments primarily through three lines of business as follows 

real estate operations segment 

rental operations  this represents the primary source of our core revenue earnings and ffo we collect rent from our customers under operating leases including reimbursements for the vast majority of our operating costs we seek to generate longterm internal growth in rental income by maintaining a high occupancy rate at our properties by controlling expenses and through contractual rent increases on existing space and renewals on rollover space thus capitalizing on the economies of scale inherent in owning operating and growing a large global portfolio our rental income is diversified due to both our global presence and our broad customer base we expect to generate longterm internal growth in rents by increasing our occupancy rate and through rent increases on existing space and renewals on rollovers we believe that our property management and leasing teams regular maintenance programs capital expenditure programs energy management and sustainability programs create cost efficiencies allowing us to leverage our global platform and provide flexible solutions for our customers as well as for us 

capital deployment activities  our development and redevelopment activities support our rental operations and are therefore included with that line of business for segment reporting we develop and redevelop industrial properties primarily in global and regional markets to meet our customers’ needs within this line of business we provide additional value creation by utilizing i the land that we currently own in global and regional markets ii the development expertise of our local personnel iii our global customer relationships and iv the demand for high quality distribution facilities in key markets we seek to increase our rental income and the net asset value of the company through the leasing of newly developed space as well as through the acquisition of new properties depending on several factors we may develop properties directly or in coinvestment ventures for longterm hold for contribution into one of our coinvestment ventures or for sale to third parties properties that we choose to contribute or sell may result in the recognition of gains or losses generally in the united states europe and japan we are developing directly while in emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico we are developing with our private capital partners in a variety of coinvestment ventures 

private capital segment  we coinvest in properties with private capital investors through a variety of coinvestment ventures we have a direct and longstanding relationship with a significant number of institutional investors we tailor industrial portfolios to investors’ specific needs and deploy capital in both closeended and openended venture structures and other joint ventures while providing complete portfolio management and financial reporting services we generally own 1550 in these ventures we believe our coinvestment in each of our ventures provides a strong alignment of interests with our coinvestment partners’ interests we generate revenues from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures by providing asset management and property management services we may also earn revenues through additional services provided such as leasing acquisition construction development disposition legal and tax services depending on the structure of the venture and the returns provided to our partners we may also earn revenues through incentive returns or promotes we believe our coinvestment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a source of capital for new investments and provide revenues for 

  

our stockholders as well as mitigate risk associated with our foreign currency exposure we expect to grow this business with the formation of new ventures such as the two ventures discussed below under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and by raising additional thirdparty capital in our existing ventures 

our operating segments 

as discussed above our current business strategy includes two operating segments real estate operations which includes our capital deployment activities and private capital please see “item 1a risk factors” our property information and market presence as presented in “item 2 properties” a discussion of our segment results in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and our segment footnote – note 22 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information with regard to the investments and results of operations of our segments 

competition 

the existence of competitively priced distribution space available in any market could have a material impact on our ability to rent space and on the rents that we can charge which impacts both of our operating segments to the extent we wish to acquire land for future development of properties in our real estate operations segment or dispose of land we may compete with local regional and national developers we also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our private capital segment 

we believe we have competitive advantages due to i our ability to respond quickly to customers’ needs for highquality distribution space in key global distribution markets ii our established relationships with key customers served by our local personnel iii our ability to leverage our organizational structure to provide a single point of contact for our global customers through our global customer solutions team iv our property management and leasing expertise v our relationships and proven track record with current and prospective investors in our private capital business vi our global experience in the development and management of industrial properties vii the strategic locations of our land that we expect to develop and viii our personnel who are experienced in the land entitlement process 

customers 

we have developed a customer base that is diverse in terms of industry concentration and represents a broad spectrum of international national regional and local distribution space users at december 31 2012 in our real estate operations segment we had 3832 customers occupying 2965 million square feet of distribution space in the unconsolidated properties we manage we had 2703 customers occupying 1959 million square feet of distribution space in our real estate operations segment our largest customer and 25 largest customers accounted for 16 and 187 respectively of our annualized base rent at december 31 2012 

within our global customer solutions team we develop longterm relationships with our customers and understand their business and needs serving as their strategic partner for real estate on a global basis keeping in close contact with customers and focusing on exceptional customer service sets us apart from other real estate providers as much more than a landlord we believe that what we offer in terms of scope scale and quality of assets is unique our indepth knowledge of our markets helps us stay ahead of trends and create forwardthinking solutions for their distribution networks this depth of customer knowledge results in greater retention and expanded service which garners additional business from the same customer across multiple geographies in our real estate operations segment approximately 500 of our annual base rent is derived from customers who lease from us in more than one location and more than one country 

in our private capital segment we consider our private capital investors to be our customers as of december 31 2012 we partnered with 107 investors several of which invest in multiple ventures 

employees 

we employ 1445 persons in our entire organization our employees work in four countries in the americas 875 persons in 15 countries in europe 385 persons and in three countries in asia 185 persons of the total we have assigned 885 employees to our real estate operations segment and 100 employees to our private capital segment we have 460 employees who work in corporate and support positions who are not assigned to a segment who may assist with segment activities we believe our relationships with our employees are good our employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements although some of our employees in europe are represented by statutory works councils and benefit from applicable labor agreements 

management’s overview 

at the time of the merger we established our key strategic priorities to guide our path through the end of 2013 these priorities were 

 

  

  

  

  

   

align our portfolio with our investment strategy 

as discussed above we have categorized our portfolio into three main segments – global regional and other markets by segmenting our markets in this manner we were able to construct a plan that includes culling the portfolio for buildings and potentially submarkets that are no longer a strategic fit we expect to use the proceeds from dispositions to pay down debt that is secured by the disposed assets if any repay other debt and to recycle capital into new development projects andor strategic acquisitions 

strengthen our financial position 

we intend to further strengthen our financial position by lowering our financial risk and currency exposure and building one of the strongest balance sheets in the reit industry we expect to lower our financial risk by reducing leverage and maintaining staggered debt maturities which will increase our financial flexibility and provide for continued access to capital markets this financial flexibility will position us to capitalize on market opportunities across the entire business cycle as they arise we expect to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations by borrowing in local currency where appropriate and utilizing derivative contracts to hedge our foreign denominated equity and swap us dollar–denominated debt into obligations denominated in foreign currencies we expect to also lower our foreign currency risk by holding assets outside the united states primarily in coinvestment ventures in which we maintain an ownership interest and provide services generating private capital revenue we will accomplish this through contributions and sales to our existing and newly formed coinvestment ventures including the new ventures in europe and japan discussed below under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in addition we expect that new development projects particularly in those emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico will be done in conjunction with our private capital partners 

streamline private capital business 

we are working with our private capital investors to rationalize certain of our coinvestment ventures some of our legacy coinvestment ventures have fee structures that do not adequately compensate us for the services we provide therefore we have terminated or restructured certain of these coinvestment ventures in other cases we may combine some coinvestment ventures to gain operational efficiencies in every case however we have and will continue to work very closely with our partners and venture investors who have been and will be active participants in these decisions we expect to continue with these activities during 2013 we plan to grow our private capital business with the deployment of the private capital commitments we have already raised formation of new coinvestment ventures including the new ventures in europe and japan and raising incremental capital for our existing coinvestment ventures 

improve the utilization of our low yielding assets 

we plan to increase the value of our low yielding assets by stabilizing our operating portfolio to 95 leased completing the buildout and leaseup of our development projects as well as monetizing our land through development or sale to third parties 

build the most effective and efficient organization in the reit industry and become the employer of choice among top professionals interested in real estate as a career 

we realized more than 115 million of cost synergies on an annualized basis compared to the combined expenses of amb and prologis on a premerger basis these synergies included gross general and administrative savings reduced global line of credit facility fees and lower amortization of non real estate assets we will continue to look for and achieve additional savings opportunities in addition we implemented a new enterprise wide system that includes a property managementbilling system implemented in april 2012 a human resources system implemented in july 2012 a general ledger and accounting system and a data warehouse implemented in january 2013 in connection with this implementation we are striving to utilize the most effective global business processes with the enhanced system functionality and have also implemented several analytical tools to further empower and assist our regional and local teams in early 2012 we implemented two new compensation plans that we believe will better align employees’ compensation to our company performance we believe these efforts and others will help us with the attainment of this objective 

see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of our 2012 results and progress attaining the objectives outlined above 

code of ethics and business conduct 

we maintain a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to our board of directors “board” and all of our officers and employees including the principal executive officer the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer or persons performing similar functions a copy of our code of ethics and business conduct is available on our website wwwprologiscom in addition to being accessible through our website copies of our code of ethics and business conduct can be obtained free of charge upon written request to investor relations pier 1 bay 1 san francisco california 94111 any amendments to or waivers of our code of ethics and business conduct that apply to the principal executive officer the principal financial officer or the principal accounting officer or persons performing similar functions and that relate to any matter enumerated in item 406b of regulation sk will be disclosed on our website 

environmental matters 

we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition either the previous owners or we subjected a majority of the properties we have acquired including land to environmental reviews while 

  

some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 and “item 1a risk factors” 

insurance coverage 

we carry insurance coverage on our properties we determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets such coverage includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy namely windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance self insurance and through a whollyowned captive insurance entity we believe that our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured however an uninsured loss could result in loss of capital investment and anticipated revenues and earnings see further discussion in “item 1a risk factors” 




 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations distributable cash flow and value of our securities these risks include among others 

general 

disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

global market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth in most major economies during the last few years although signs of recovery are emerging there are continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation the availability and cost of credit a lagging real estate market and geopolitical issues that contribute to increased market volatility and uncertain expectations for the global economy to the extent there is turmoil in the financial markets it has the potential to materially affect the value of our properties and investments in our unconsolidated entities the availability or the terms of financing that we and our unconsolidated entities have or may anticipate utilizing our ability and that of our unconsolidated entities to make principal and interest payments on or refinance any outstanding debt when due and may impact the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases 

the market volatility over the last several years has made the valuation of our properties and those of our unconsolidated entities more difficult there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation or in the stability of the value of our properties and those we invest in through unconsolidated entities that could result in a decrease in the value of our properties and our investments in unconsolidated entities as a result we may not be able to recover the current carrying amount of our investments in real estate properties including our unconsolidated entities which may require us to recognize an impairment charge in earnings where it is known in addition to the charges we previously recognized 

any additional continued or recurring disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

as a global company we are subject to social political and economic risks of doing business in many countries 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states during 2012 we generated approximately 418 or 8386 million of our revenue from operations outside the united states circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flow include but are not limited to the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 our global growth also subjects us to certain risks including risks associated with funding increasing headcount integrating new offices and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws 

although we have committed substantial resources to expand our global platform if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

in addition our international operations and specifically the ability of our nonunited states subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt may be affected by currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other things 

the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the functional currency at december 31 2012 approximately 406 or 111 billion of our total assets are invested in a currency other than the us dollar primarily the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen as a result we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our financial position debt covenant ratios results of operations and cash flow although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and using derivative contracts there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency the funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of foreign currency the failure to hedge effectively against exchange rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets which may reduce economic returns to investors 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions in addition significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as secured mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments like other companies qualifying as reits under the internal revenue code we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable reit subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property while we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment in order to generate liquidity if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale we may not pursue such sales 

in the event that we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation divesting ourselves of properties whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term at less than optimal terms incurring debt entering into leases with our customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates at turnover there can be no assurance however that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us additionally taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

risks related to our business 

general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results 

we are exposed to general economic conditions local regional national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties 

  

as of december 31 2012 approximately 251 of our consolidated operating properties or 57 billion based on investment before depreciation are located in california which represented 205 of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 231 of our annualized base rent our revenue from and the value of our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california’s economic climate because of the number of properties we have located in california a downturn in california’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

in addition to california we also have significant holdings defined as more than 3 of total investment before depreciation in operating properties in certain global and regional markets located in chicago dallasfort worth france japan mexico new jerseynew york city south florida and the united kingdom our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties conditions such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space among other factors may impact operating conditions any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction in demand for distribution space could adversely affect our results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of our securities 

in addition the unconsolidated entities in which we invest have concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above as well as in markets in germany the netherlands poland and seattle are subject to the economic conditions in those markets 

a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity united states properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the san francisco bay area los angeles and seattle international properties located in active seismic areas include japan and mexico we generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to self insure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis we have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for wholly owned assets in japan based on this analysis 

further a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane andor flood risk we carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants 

our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses 

we and our unconsolidated entities currently carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy namely windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets we believe our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated entities are adequately insured however there are certain losses including losses from floods earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property 

furthermore we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and if there is recourse debt then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business 

investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio market research and our property management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated some of the factors that may affect real estate values include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 our investments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector 

our investments in real estate assets are primarily concentrated in the industrial distribution sector this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified 

our operating results and distributable cash flow will depend on the continued generation of lease revenues from customers and we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or release space on favorable terms as leases expire 

our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations we are also subject to the risk that upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties leases may not be renewed by existing customers the space may not be released to new customers or the terms of renewal or releasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers we may lose potential customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain customers when our customers’ leases expire in the event of default by a significant number of customers we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord and may be unable to release spaces a customer may experience a downturn in its business which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease in addition a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow 

if we decide to contribute or sell properties to an unconsolidated entity or third parties to generate proceeds we may not be successful 

we may contribute or sell properties to certain of our unconsolidated entities or third parties on a casebycase basis our ability to sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties market conditions including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties and other factors beyond our control if our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets andor at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or on favorable terms or at all the unconsolidated entity or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital in the private and public markets in order to acquire properties from us should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then dispositions could be delayed if we are unable to generate proceeds through property sales we may have to delay our deleveraging plans which may result in adverse effects on our liquidity distributable cash flow debt covenant ratio and the market price of our securities 

we may acquire properties which involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results and the value of our securities 

we may acquire industrial properties the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates when we acquire properties we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures additionally there is and it is expected there will continue to be significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities 

our real estate development strategies may not be successful 

our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through sales to third parties development of industrial properties to hold for longterm investment or contribution or sale to an unconsolidated entity depending on market conditions our liquidity needs and other factors we may expand investment in our development renovation and redevelopment business and we will complete the buildout and leasing of our development platform we may also develop renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed development coinvestment ventures the real estate development renovation and redevelopment business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities which include the following risks 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our operating results financial condition and cash flow 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination 

environmental laws in some countries including the united states also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of our properties are known to contain asbestoscontaining building materials 

in addition some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances further certain of our properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in connection with certain divested properties we have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties 

we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the presence of such substances on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow 

we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming coinvestment ventures investing in new or existing coinvestment ventures attracting third party investment and investing in and managing properties through coinvestment ventures 

as of december 31 2012 we had an investment in real estate containing approximately 2145 million square feet held through unconsolidated entities our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in unconsolidated entities and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through coinvestment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances however there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new coinvestment ventures attract third party investment or make additional investments in new or existing coinvestment ventures successfully develop or acquire properties through unconsolidated entities or realize value from such unconsolidated entities our inability to do so may have an adverse effect on our growth our earnings and the market price of our securities 

  

our partners in our unconsolidated investments may share certain approval rights over major decisions and some partners may manage the properties in the unconsolidated entities our unconsolidated investments involve certain risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

 we generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our unconsolidated entities to permit us to achieve our business objectives however we may not be able to do so we have formed publicly traded investment vehicles like our publicly traded reit in japan for which we serve as sponsor andor manager we have contributed and may continue to contribute assets into such vehicles as with any of our publicly traded entities or funds there is a risk that we may not be able to continue to manage such entities and their assets in the event that our managerial relationship is terminated 

the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have acquired and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties then we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it which could adversely affect our cash flow contingent or unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include 

 

  

  

  

  

 risks related to financing and capital 

we face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business activities including refinancing and interest rate risks and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to make required payments on our debt or are unable to refinance our debt 

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected and if the maturing debt is secured the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness our global senior credit agreement japanese yenbased credit agreement and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements from time to time we may enter into interest rate swap or cap agreements such hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements the funds required to settle any swap breakage arrangements if any could be significant depending on the size of underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of breakage the failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position in addition our unconsolidated entities may be unable to refinance indebtedness or meet payment obligations which may impact our distributable cash flow and our financial condition andor we may be required to recognize impairment charges of our investments 

  

covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition 

the terms of our various credit agreements including our global senior credit agreement and japanese yenbased credit agreement the indentures under which our senior notes are issued and other note agreements require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage leverage ratios fixed charge ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness if we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition could be adversely affected 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity 

the credit ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing also a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our refinancing and other capital market activities our ability to manage debt maturities our future growth our financial condition the market price of our securities and our development and acquisition activity 

we are dependent on external sources of capital  

in order to qualify as a reit we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain and we may be subject to tax to the extent our income is not fully distributed while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances our own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december 31 2012 and in some cases declared as late as december 31 2013 the reit can satisfy up to 90 of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital further in order to maintain our reit status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities 

our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock 

any additional future issuance of common stock will reduce the percentage of our common stock owned by investors in most circumstances stockholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock in addition depending on the terms and pricing of an additional offering of our common stock and the value of the properties our stockholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock 

federal income tax risks 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences 

we elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code commencing with the taxable year ended december 31 1997 we believe we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit however it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a reit or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex sections of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control for example in order to qualify as a reit prologis must derive at least 95 of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis the provisions of the internal revenue code and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a reit are more complicated in our case because we hold assets through the operating partnership 

  

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on taxable income at regular corporate rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification if we lost our reit status our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved 

furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit gross income tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to united states federal income tax in addition a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties including by contributing properties to our coinvestment ventures under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue code may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions while we believe that the internal revenue code would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue code were to argue successfully that a transfer disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 

legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax taws applicable to investments in reits and similar entities additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders 

other risks 

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees from time to time our personnel and their roles may change in connection with the completion of the merger there were changes to our personnel and their roles while we believe that we have retained our key talent and have found suitable employees to meet our personnel needs the loss of key personnel any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market price of our securities if we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs 

under the americans with disabilities act places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants if we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the americans with disabilities act including removing access barriers then our cash flow and the amounts available to make distributions and payments to our security holders may be adversely affected our properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and lifesafety requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements while we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

we are subject to governmental regulations and actions that affect operating results and financial condition 

many laws including tax laws and governmental regulations apply to us our unconsolidated entities and our properties changes in these laws and governmental regulations or their interpretation by agencies or the courts could occur which might affect our ability to conduct business 

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures 

  

and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations restatements of our financial statements a decline in the price of our securities or otherwise materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate change related risks 

we consider that we are exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate our distribution facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events such as severe storms andor floods if the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change our exposure to these events could increase 

we do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change as our operations do not emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases however we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain andor stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings

 item 2 properties 

we are invested in real estate properties that are primarily generic industrial properties in japan our industrial properties are generally multilevel centers which is common in japan due to the high cost and limited availability of land our properties are typically used for distribution storage packaging assembly and light manufacturing of consumer and industrial products based on the square footage of the operating properties included in our real estate operations segment at december 31 2012 and discussed below all of our properties are industrial properties consisting of 928 used for bulk distribution 47 used for light manufacturing and assembly 10 used for flex industrial 09 used for ontarmac and 06 used for other purposes 

geographic distribution 

our investment strategy focuses on providing distribution and logistics space to customers whose businesses are tied to global trade and depend on the efficient movement of goods through the global supply chain our properties are primarily located in two main market types global markets and regional markets global markets account for 847 of our consolidated operating properties based on investment balance and comprise approximately 30 of the largest and most liquid markets tied to global trade these markets feature large population centers with high percapita consumption rates and close proximity to airports seaports and ground transportation systems regional markets account for 116 of our consolidated operating properties similar to global markets regional markets benefit from large population centers but typically are not as tied to the global supply chain and are often less supply constrained 

  

the information in the following tables is as of december 31 2012 for our consolidated operating properties properties in our development portfolio and land including 157 buildings owned by entities we consolidate but of which we own less than 100 all of these assets are included in our real estate operations segment this includes our portfolio of operating properties we developed or are currently developing no individual property or group of properties operating as a single business unit amounted to 10 or more of our consolidated total assets at december 31 2012 or generated income equal to 10 or more of our consolidated gross revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 these tables do not include properties that are owned by unconsolidated entities 

 

   

 the following is a summary of our investment in consolidated real estate properties at december 31 2012 

 

  

   

  

  

 in december 2012 and february 2013 we announced the formation of two new coinvestment ventures in europe and japan respectively we have 207 operating properties aggregating approximately 50 billion that we have contributed or expect to contribute these two entities in 2013 see further discussion below under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

unconsolidated coinvestment ventures

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we and our unconsolidated entities are parties to a variety of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business we believe that with respect to any such matters that we are currently a party to the ultimate disposition of any such matter will not result in a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations

dividends 

in order to comply with the reit requirements of the internal revenue code we are generally required to make common and preferred stock dividends other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders in amounts that together at least equal i the sum of a 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains and b 90 of the net income after tax if any from foreclosure property minus ii certain excess noncash income our common stock distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow that ensures that we will meet the distribution requirements of the internal revenue code and that allows us to also retain cash to meet other needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities 

in 2012 we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 028 per common share our future common stock dividends may vary and will be determined by our board upon the circumstances prevailing at the time including our financial condition operating results and reit distribution requirements and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report and the matters described under “item 1a risk factors” 

management’s overview 

at the time of the merger we established our key strategic priorities to guide our path through the end of 2013 these priorities were 

 

  

  

  

  

 align our portfolio with our investment strategy 

we have categorized our portfolio into three main segments – global regional and other markets by segmenting our markets in this manner we were able to construct a plan that includes culling the portfolio for buildings and potentially submarkets that are no longer a strategic fit we expect to use the proceeds from dispositions to pay down debt that is secured by the disposed assets if any repay other debt and to recycle capital into new development projects andor strategic acquisitions 

strengthen our financial position 

we intend to further strengthen our financial position by lowering our financial risk and currency exposure and building one of the strongest balance sheets in the reit industry we expect to lower our financial risk by reducing leverage and maintaining staggered debt maturities which will increase our financial flexibility and provide for continued access to capital markets this financial flexibility will position us to capitalize on market opportunities across the entire business cycle as they arise we expect to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations by borrowing in local currency where appropriate and utilizing derivative contracts to hedge our foreign denominated equity and swap us dollar–denominated debt into obligations denominated in foreign currencies we expect to also lower our foreign currency risk by holding assets outside the united states primarily in coinvestment ventures in which we maintain an ownership interest and provide services generating private capital revenue we will accomplish this through contributions and sales to our existing and newly formed coinvestment ventures including the new ventures in europe and japan discussed below in addition we expect that new development projects particularly in those emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico will be done in conjunction with our private capital partners 

streamline private capital business 

we are working with our private capital investors to rationalize certain of our coinvestment ventures some of our legacy coinvestment ventures have fee structures that do not adequately compensate us for the services we provide therefore we have terminated or restructured certain of these coinvestment ventures in other cases we may combine some coinvestment ventures to gain operational efficiencies in every case however we have and will continue to work very closely with our partners and venture investors who have been and will be active participants in these decisions we expect to continue with these activities during 2013 we plan to grow our private capital business with the deployment of the private capital commitments we have already raised formation of new coinvestment ventures including the new ventures in europe and japan and raising incremental capital for our existing coinvestment ventures 

  

improve the utilization of our low yielding assets 

we plan to increase the value of our low yielding assets by stabilizing our operating portfolio to 95 leased completing the buildout and leaseup of our development projects as well as monetizing our land through development or sale to third parties 

build the most effective and efficient organization in the reit industry and become the employer of choice among top professionals interested in real estate as a career 

we realized more than 115 million of cost synergies on an annualized basis compared to the combined expenses of amb and prologis on a premerger basis these synergies included gross general and administrative savings reduced global line of credit facility fees and lower amortization of non real estate assets we will continue to look for and achieve additional savings opportunities in addition we implemented a new enterprise wide system that includes a property managementbilling system implemented in april 2012 a human resources system implemented in july 2012 a general ledger and accounting system and a data warehouse implemented in january 2013 in connection with this implementation we are striving to utilize the most effective global business processes with the enhanced system functionality and have also implemented several analytical tools to further empower and assist our regional and local teams in early 2012 we implemented two new compensation plans that we believe will better align employees’ compensation to our company performance we believe these efforts and others will help us with the attainment of this objective

 operational outlook 

the recovery in industrial real estate markets continues around the world we believe all signals point to a positive outlook for our sector the international monetary fund is forecasting global trade growth at 38 for 2013 and approximately 5 for 2014 improving industrial production and new goods orders also indicate strengthening economic growth according to the united states bureau of economic analysis inventories in the united states have now been growing for the last 11 out of 12 quarters and are almost back to their precrisis levels we expect further rebuilding of inventories this year to levels that will surpass the previous peak this increase in inventories is driven primarily by the fact that the united states population has grown by 12 million during that same timeframe 

total net absorption during the fourth quarter was 56 million square feet according to cbre inc the strongest single quarter since 2006 the availability rate continues to fall 128 at december 31 2012 and supply remains at historically low levels further as the recovery broadens throughout the united states demand should increase across more of the major tenant business sectors further reducing vacancy spaces smaller than 100000 square feet this segment is closely tied to the recovery in the housing market and we expect demand to increase in the future thus overall conditions in the united states industrial market should continue to improve and as such we are forecasting 150 million square feet of net absorption in 2013 

in europe net absorption continues to be positive and has been since we began collecting the data series in the first quarter of 2011 the supply of classa distribution space remains constrained in both japan and china we expect the supply chain reconfiguration in japan and growing consumption in china to continue to drive demand for our product in the longterm demand for classa facilities remains strong in latin america brazil continues to be an underserved logistics market as growing gdp and increasing consumption is driving high levels of new requirements into the market demand momentum has been similarly positive in mexico benefitting from the economic recovery in the us and increasingly frequent instances of ‘nearshoring’ of production activities net absorption has been positive for several years and market occupancy rates increased 80 basis points to 915 percent during 2012 across the six largest markets 

in our total owned and managed operating portfolio we leased a record 1453 million square feet of space in 2012 we ended the year with 940 occupancy in our owned and managed operating portfolio up 180 basis points over year end 2011 the effective rental rates on leases signed during the fourth quarter of 2012 in our same store portfolio as defined below decreased by 24 when compared with the rental 

  

rates on the previous leases on that same space the decline was primarily attributed to regional markets in europe where leases were signed at the high point of the prior cycle rent change is continuing its upward trend in our portfolio and we expect positive rollover in 2013 tenant retention in the fourth quarter was 873 

due to the lack of supply of classa facilities high space utilization rates and decreasing vacancy rates we expect development volume to increase in our markets our development business comprises speculative development buildtosuit development valueadded conversions and redevelopment we expect to develop directly and within our coinvestment structures depending on location market conditions submarkets or building sites and availability of capital in response to this increasing demand we are actively pursuing various development opportunities and we commenced development of 40 properties in our owned and managed portfolio during 2012 

results of operations 

summary 

the following table illustrates the net operating income for each of our segments along with the reconciling items to loss from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 in thousands 

 

 see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our segments and a reconciliation of net operating income to loss before income taxes  

real estate operations segment 

the net operating income of the real estate operations segment consisted of rental income and rental expenses from industrial properties that we own and consolidate and is impacted by our capital deployment activities this segment excludes amounts presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods the size and percentage of occupancy of our consolidated operating portfolio fluctuates due to the timing of acquisitions development activity and contributions such fluctuations affect the net operating income we recognize in this segment in a particular period also included in this segment is revenue from land we own and lease to customers under ground leases and development management and other income offset by acquisition disposition and land holding costs the net operating income from the real estate operations segment for the years ended december 31 was as follows in thousands 

 

 the increase in rental income and rental expense in 2012 from 2011 was due primarily to the impact of the merger and the pepr acquisition in the second quarter of 2011 the coinvestment venture acquisitions and other acquisitions in 2012 and increased occupancy in our consolidated operating properties from 914 at december 31 2011 to 937 at december 31 2012 including the completion and stabilization of new development properties the results for 2012 included rental income and expenses from properties acquired through the merger and pepr acquisition of 8340 million and 2289 million respectively while 2011 included approximately seven months of rental income and expense of properties acquired through the merger and pepr acquisition of 5247 million and 1425 million respectively in our consolidated portfolio we leased 885 million square feet in 2012 compared to 634 million square feet in 2011 

the increase in net operating income in 2011 over 2010 was due primarily to the impact of the merger and the pepr acquisition in the second quarter of 2011 increased occupancy in our consolidated operating properties from 859 at december 2010 to 914 at december 2011 and the completion and stabilization of new development properties 

  

we calculate the change in effective rental rates on leases signed during the quarter as compared to the previous rent on that same space in our same store portfolio as defined below during 2012 over the four quarters the percentage change in rental rates ranged from a decrease of 39 to a decrease of 11 during 2011 over the four quarters the percentage change in rental rates ranged from a decrease of 89 to a decrease of 45 a decline in rental rates was due to i leases turning that were put in place when market rents were at or near peak and ii decreased market rents 

under the terms of our lease agreements we are able to recover the majority of our rental expenses from customers rental expense recoveries included in both rental income and rental expenses were 740 737 and 756 of total rental expenses for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

our consolidated operating properties as of december 31 were as follows square feet in thousands 

 

  

 as discussed earlier we have 207 operating properties aggregating approximately 50 billion that we have contributed in 2013 or expect to contribute to npr and pelp as a result we expect to have decreased rental income and rental expenses in 2013 in this segment we will account for our continuing ownership in the properties through our equity ownership in the ventures by recognizing our share of the net income or loss of the ventures we will also recognize additional revenue in our private capital segment from the property management and asset management services we will provide 

private capital segment 

the net operating income of the private capital segment consisted of fees and incentives earned for services performed for our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures and certain joint ventures and third parties reduced by our direct costs of managing these entities and the properties they own 

the direct costs associated with our private capital segment totaled 638 million 550 million and 407 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively and are included in the line item private capital expenses in our consolidated statements of operations these expenses include the direct expenses associated with the asset management of the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures provided by our employees who are assigned to our private capital segment in addition in order to achieve efficiencies and economies of scale all of our property management functions are provided by a team of professionals who are assigned to our real estate operations segment these individuals perform the propertylevel management of the properties in our owned and managed portfolio including properties we consolidate and the properties we manage that are owned by the unconsolidated entities we allocate the costs of our property management function to the properties we consolidate reported in rental expenses  and the properties owned by the unconsolidated entities included in private capital expenses  by using the square feet owned by the respective portfolios the increase in private capital expenses in 2012 is due to the increased private capital platform and infrastructure that was part of the merger offset partially with a decline in the portion of our property management expenses that are allocated to this segment due to the consolidation of pepr in june 2011 and the coinvestment venture acquisitions in 2012 

the net operating income from the private capital segment representing fees earned reduced by private capital expenses for the years ended december 31 was as follows in thousands 

 

  

   

  

 we expect the net operating income of this segment to increase in 2013 due to npr and pelp and from the contributions of properties to existing coinvestment ventures offset slightly by the decrease in revenue from some other coinvestment ventures as they are concluded 

see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on our unconsolidated entities 

other components of income 

general and administrative “ga” expenses 

ga expenses for the years ended december 31 consisted of the following in thousands 

 

 the increase in ga expenses and the various components from 2011 to 2012 and from 2010 to 2011 was due principally to the larger infrastructure associated with the combined company following the merger and the pepr acquisition the increase in capitalized ga is due to our increased development and leasing activities since the merger 

we capitalize certain costs directly related to our development and leasing activities capitalized ga expenses included salaries and related costs as well as other general and administrative costs the capitalized ga costs for the years ended december 31 was as follows in thousands 

 

 for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 the capitalized salaries and related costs represented 191 193 and 161 respectively of our total capitalizable salaries and related costs in addition in 2012 we capitalized 12 million of salaries and related costs related to internally developed software that were included as merger acquisition and other integration expenses  salaries and related costs are comprised primarily of wages other compensation and employeerelated expenses in 2012 we began consolidated development projects with a total expected investment of 13 billion 06 billion in the fourth quarter as compared to 08 billion in 2011 as discussed earlier we expect our development activity to continue to increase in 2013 

merger acquisition and other integration expenses 

in connection with the merger and other related activities we incurred significant transaction integration and transitional costs of 807 million and 1405 million during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively we believe the majority of these costs have been realized as of december 31 2012 and any additional costs incurred in 2013 will be included in ga expenses  see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more detail on these expenses 

impairment of real estate properties 

during 2012 2011 and 2010 we recognized impairment charges of real estate properties in continuing operations of 2529 million 212 million and 7366 million respectively due to our change of intent to no longer hold these assets for longterm investment in 2012 these impairment charges related to our planned contribution of properties to pelp 1353 million land parcels that we expected to sell to third parties 889 million and operating buildings we expected to contribute or sell 287 million in 2010 the charges primarily included land as a result of our change in strategy changes in economic and operating conditions and our ultimate intent with regard to our 

  

investments in real estate that occur in the future may result in additional impairment charges or gains at the time of sale see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more detail on the process we took to value these assets and the related impairment charges recognized 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization was 7400 million 5528 million and 2949 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase from 2011 to 2012 is due to additional depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the assets including intangible assets acquired in the merger and pepr acquisition during the second quarter of 2011 and the coinvestment venture acquisitions in 2012 as well as completed and leased development properties and additional leasing and capital improvements in our operating properties the increase from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the properties acquired through the merger and pepr acquisition completed and leased development properties and increased leasing activity 

earnings from unconsolidated entities net 

we recognized net earnings of 317 million 599 million and 237 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively these earnings relate to our investment in unconsolidated entities that are accounted for on the equity method the earnings decreased in 2012 from 2011 due to the consolidation of pepr and the coinvestment venture acquisitions as such ventures were previously accounted for under the equity method this decrease was partially offset by earnings from investments acquired through the merger in 2012 we recorded a loss of 93 million for our share of a loss on the early extinguishment of debt in prologis north american industrial fund iii the primary reason for the increase in 2011 over 2010 is due to the investments we acquired through the merger partially offset by the consolidation of pepr the earnings we recognize are impacted by i variances in revenues and expenses of the entity ii the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by the entity iii our ownership interest in the entity and iv fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to us dollars if applicable we manage the majority of the properties in which we have an ownership interest as part of our total owned and managed portfolio see discussion of our portfolio results in the section “portfolio information” see also note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized 

we expect increases in earnings from unconsolidated entities in 2013 due to our share of net earnings from npr and pelp that we expect to recognize after contributions made in 2013 

interest expense 

interest expense from continuing operations included the following components in thousands for the years ended december 31 

 

 gross interest expense increased in 2012 and 2011 from the previous year primarily due to higher debt levels as a result of the merger the pepr acquisition and the coinvestment venture acquisitions in 2012 partially offset by lower effective borrowing costs and replacement of debt at lower rates 

although our strategic objective is to reduce our debt and leverage with proceeds from property dispositions we temporarily increased our debt in 2012 by 14 billion from the coinvestment venture acquisitions we plan to pay down debt with the proceeds from the contribution of properties in early 2013 and disposition of properties in 2013 as a result of the merger and pepr acquisition we added approximately 59 billion of debt at fair value at the beginning of june 2011 and approximately seven months of related interest expense in 2011 which increased our debt balance as of december 31 2011 to 114 billion see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 and liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs 

our weighted average effective borrowing cost was 46 56 and 65 for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our future interest expense both gross interest and the portion capitalized will vary depending on among other things our effective borrowing rate and the level of our development activities 

impairment of goodwill and other assets 

based on our review of goodwill in 2010 we recognized an impairment charge of 3685 million related to goodwill allocated to the real estate operations segment in the americas and europe reporting units the review of goodwill was triggered by the strategic decision we made in the fourth quarter of 2010 to significantly downsize our development platform and as a result to sell to third parties certain other assets some of which were acquired in the acquisitions that originally created the goodwill 

  

in 2012 2011 and 2010 we recorded impairment charges of 161 million 1264 million and 443 million respectively on certain of our investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities notes receivable and other assets as we did not believe these amounts to be recoverable based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows associated with these assets including estimated sales proceeds or we believed the decline in fair value to be other than temporary 

see notes 2 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information on our process with regard to analyzing the recoverability of goodwill and other assets 

gains on acquisitions and dispositions of investments in real estate net 

in 2012 we recognized net gains on acquisitions and dispositions of investments in real estate in continuing operations of 3056 million which included 2942 million of gains related to the coinvestment venture acquisitions and 114 million of gains principally related to contribution activity we received proceeds of 3819 million from the contribution of 25 properties aggregating 48 million square feet 

during 2011 we recognized net gains on acquisitions and dispositions of investments in real estate in continuing operations of 1117 million this included gains recognized in the second quarter related to the pepr acquisition 859 million and the acquisition of our partner’s interest in one of our other unconsolidated joint ventures in japan 135 million the gains represent the adjustment to fair value of our equity investments at the time we gained control and consolidated the entities the contribution activity in 2011 resulted in cash proceeds of 5908 million and net gains of 123 million 

during 2010 we recognized net gains on dispositions of investments in real estate in continuing operations of 285 million which related to the contribution of land and operating properties to unconsolidated entities 583 million gain additional proceeds from contributions we made to pepf ii in 2009 based on valuations received as of december 31 2010 and our contribution agreement with the venture 274 million gain and the sale of land parcels to third parties 74 million gain offset by a loss of 646 million related to the sale of certain unconsolidated entities 

the 2010 contribution activity resulted in cash proceeds of 4697 million related to the contribution of development properties aggregating 21 million square feet and land to unconsolidated entities and the sale of 90 of two development properties in japan aggregating 13 million square feet we continue to own 10 of the japan properties which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we continue to manage the properties 

if we realize a gain on contribution or sale of a property to an unconsolidated entity we recognize the portion attributable to the third party ownership in the entity if we realize a loss on contribution we recognize the full amount as soon as it is known due to our continuing involvement through our ownership in the unconsolidated entity these dispositions are not included in discontinued operations 

foreign currency and derivative gains losses net 

we and certain of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries may have intercompany or third party debt that is not denominated in the entity’s functional currency when the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity a gain or loss may result to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate certain of our intercompany debt is remeasured with the resulting adjustment recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in foreign currency translation loss net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss this treatment is applicable to intercompany debt that is deemed to be longterm in nature 

if the intercompany debt is deemed shortterm in nature when the debt is remeasured we recognize a gain or loss in earnings we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of 74 million in 2012 and losses of 59 million and 115 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively related to the remeasurement of debt predominantly the gains or losses recognized in earnings relate to the remeasurement of intercompany loans between the united states parent and certain consolidated subsidiaries in japan and europe and result from fluctuations in the exchange rates of us dollar to the euro japanese yen and british pound sterling in addition we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of 56 million and gains of 21 million and 04 million from the settlement of transactions with third parties during december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

we recognized an unrealized loss of 223 million in 2012 and an unrealized gain of 450 million in 2011 on the derivative instrument exchange feature related to our exchangeable senior notes which became exchangeable at the time of the merger 

gains losses on early extinguishment of debt net 

during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we purchased portions of several series of senior notes senior exchangeable notes and eurobonds outstanding and extinguished some secured mortgage debt prior to maturity which resulted in the recognition of losses of 141 million in 2012 gains of 03 million in 2011 and losses of 2015 million in 2010 the gains or losses represent the difference between the recorded debt net of premiums and discounts and including related debt issuance costs and the consideration we paid to retire the debt including fees included in this amount in 2012 are losses that were included in other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss related to hedge transactions and were deemed unrecoverable in the fourth quarter of 2012 these hedges were associated with debt that is expected to be repaid before maturity in europe with the proceeds from the contributions to pelp in early 2013 see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information regarding our debt repurchases 

  

income tax benefit expense 

during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 our current income tax expense was 179 million 216 million and 217 million respectively we recognize current income tax expense for income taxes incurred by our taxable reit subsidiaries and in certain foreign jurisdictions as well as certain state taxes we also include in current income tax expense the interest associated with our liability for uncertain tax positions our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income and changes in tax and interest rates 

in 2012 2011 and 2010 we recognized a net deferred tax benefit of 143 million 198 million and 522 million respectively deferred income tax expense is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in certain of our taxable subsidiaries operating in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions the deferred tax benefit recorded during 2010 is primarily due to impairment charges recorded to the book basis of real estate properties and investments in unconsolidated entities net operating loss “nol” carryforwards recorded for certain jurisdictions and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to builtingains in addition during the second quarter of 2010 we recognized a deferred income tax benefit of approximately 275 million resulting from the conversion of two of our european management companies to taxable entities this conversion was approved by the applicable tax authorities in june 2010 and created an asset for tax purposes that will be utilized against future taxable income as it is amortized the deferred tax benefit was partially offset by an increase to the valuation allowance in certain jurisdictions because we could not sustain a conclusion that it was more likely than not that we could realize the deferred tax assets and nol carryforwards 

our income taxes are discussed in more detail in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

discontinued operations 

discontinued operations represent a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale if both the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction the results of operations that have been classified as discontinued operations are reported separately in our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

during 2012 2011 and 2010 we disposed of land subject to ground leases and 200 94 and 205 operating properties respectively to third parties that met the requirements to be classified as discontinued operations we recognized aggregate net gains on these transactions net of impairment charges of 351 million 586 million and 2346 million during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the results of operations of these properties for 2012 2011 and 2010 were 276 million 506 million and 965 million respectively 

see notes 4 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

other comprehensive income loss – foreign currency translation losses net 

for our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar we translate their financial statements into us dollars at the time we consolidate those subsidiaries’ financial statements generally assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments due to the fluctuations in exchange rates from the beginning of the period to the end of the period are included in foreign currency translation losses net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss  

during 2012 we recorded unrealized net losses of 790 million as the japanese yen rates weakened to the us dollar by 101 from december 31 2011 to december 31 2012 offset slightly by the euro and british pound sterling slightly strengthening against the us dollar during the same period during 2011 we recorded unrealized net losses of 1926 million as the euro and british pound sterling remained relatively flat from december 31 2010 to december 31 2011 but both weakened to the us dollar from the merger and pepr acquisition date to december 31 2011 these losses were offset slightly by the strengthening of the japanese yen to the us dollar during 2011 during 2010 we recognized unrealized net losses of 452 million mainly as a result of the weakening of the euro and british pound sterling to the us dollar offset by the japanese yen strengthening against the us dollar from the beginning of the year to december 31 2010 

portfolio information 

our total owned and managed properties includes operating industrial properties but not properties under development properties held for sale or nonindustrial properties and was as follows as of december 31 square feet in thousands 

 

   

same store analysis 

we evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures we include properties from our consolidated portfolio and properties owned by the coinvestment ventures accounted for on the equity method that are managed by us referred to as “unconsolidated entities” including those owned and managed by amb prior to the merger in our same store analysis we have defined the same store portfolio for the three months ended december 31 2012 as those properties that were in operation at january 1 2011 and have been in operation throughout the same threemonth periods in both 2012 and 2011 we have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party or were classified as held for sale from the population for both periods we believe the factors that impact rental income rental expenses and net operating income in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total portfolio in order to derive an appropriate measure of periodtoperiod operating performance we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the current exchange rate to translate from local currency into us dollars for both periods the same store portfolio for the three months ended december 31 2012 included 5020 million of aggregated square feet 

the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental income rental expenses and net operating income calculated as rental income and recoveries less rental expenses for the full year as included in our consolidated statements of operations in item 8 to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis dollars in thousands 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

   

 environmental matters 

a majority of the properties acquired by us were subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we record a liability for the estimated costs of environmental remediation to be incurred in connection with certain operating properties we acquire as well as certain land parcels we acquire in connection with the planned development of the land the liability is established to cover the environmental remediation costs including cleanup costs consulting fees for studies and investigations monitoring costs and legal costs relating to cleanup litigation defense and the pursuit of responsible third parties we purchase various environmental insurance policies to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities dispositions of properties and from available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development acquisition operating debt service dividend and distribution requirements 

nearterm principal cash sources and uses 

in addition to dividends to the common and preferred stockholders of prologis inc and distributions to the limited partnership units of the operating partnership we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we expect to fund our cash needs principally from the following sources all subject to market conditions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 debt 

as of december 31 2012 we had 118 billion of debt during 2012 we temporarily increased our debt by 14 billion as part of the coinvestment venture acquisitions and the issuance of 4931 million of new debt offset partially by repayments of debt 

as of december 31 2012 we had credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 21 billion of which 12 billion was available remaining capacity 

as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants these covenants include customary financial covenants for total debt ratios encumbered debt ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios

in connection with the pelp contribution we expect to use the proceeds to further reduce debt and to fund our development and acquisition activities 

see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information on our debt 

equity commitments related to certain coinvestment ventures 

certain coinvestment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners we may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash we are committed to offer to contribute certain properties that we develop and stabilize in select markets in europe mexico and japan to certain coinvestment ventures these ventures are committed to acquire such properties subject to certain exceptions including that the properties meet certain specified leasing and other criteria and that the ventures have available capital generally the venture obtains financing for the properties and therefore the equity commitment is less than the acquisition price of the real estate we are not obligated to contribute properties at a loss depending on market conditions the investment objectives of the ventures our liquidity needs and other factors we may make contributions of properties to these ventures through the remaining commitment period

distribution and dividend requirements 

our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure we will meet the dividend requirements of the internal revenue code relative to maintaining our reit status while still allowing us to retain cash to meet other needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities 

in 2012 we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 028 per common share a cash dividend of 028 for the first quarter of 2013 was declared on february 27 2013 this dividend will be paid on march 29 2013 to holders of common shares on march 12 2013 our future common stock dividends may vary and will be determined by our board upon the circumstances prevailing at the time including our financial condition operating results and reit distribution requirements and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year 

at december 31 2012 we had seven series of preferred stock outstanding the annual dividend rates on preferred stock are 65 per series l share 675 per series m share 70 per series o share 685 per series p share 854 per series q share 675 per series r share and 675 per series s share the dividends on preferred stock are payable quarterly in arrears 

pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock has been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock 

critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity’s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management generally the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance of the accounting policies discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

we assess the carrying values of our respective longlived assets including goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable 

recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change as well as other factors especially in the current global economic environment fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property quoted market values and third party appraisals where considered necessary the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill at the reporting unit level the annual review is performed during the fourth quarter for all our reporting units additionally we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill may not be fully recoverable 

in september 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an accounting standard update that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test we utilized the qualitative assessment for our 2012 annual impairment test 

assumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties andor goodwill 

other than temporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated entities 

when circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary if we determine there is a loss in value that is other than temporary we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the 

  

investment at fair value the use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value the determination of when a loss is other than temporary and the calculation of the amount of the loss is complex and subjective use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions changes in economic and operating conditions as well as changes in our intent with regard to our investment that occur subsequent to our review could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our equity investments 

revenue recognition – gains on disposition of real estate 

we recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets generally at the time the title is transferred consideration is received and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold in many of our transactions an entity in which we have an ownership interest will acquire a real estate asset from us we make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the entity that acquires the assets we also make judgments regarding recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives based on when they are earned fixed and determinable 

business combinations 

we acquire individual properties as well as portfolios of properties or businesses when we acquire a business or individual operating properties with the intention to hold the investment for the longterm we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component the components typically include land building debt intangible assets related to above and below market leases value of costs to obtain tenants deferred tax liabilities and other assumed assets and liabilities in the case of an acquisition of a business in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often times is based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located the fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment which may differ when final information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period which typically does not exceed one year 

consolidation 

we consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100 but control as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity investments in entities in which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method investments in entities that we do not control and over which we do not exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as appropriate our ability to correctly assess our influence andor control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements 

capitalization of costs and depreciation 

we capitalize costs incurred in developing renovating rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred during the land development and construction periods we capitalize interest costs insurance real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets we also capitalize costs incurred to successfully originate a lease that result directly from and are essential to the acquisition of that lease leasing costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are presented as a component of other assets 

we estimate the depreciable portion of our real estate assets and related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense our ability to estimate the depreciable portions of our real estate assets and useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets any change to the assets to be depreciated and the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to estimate our income tax liability the liability associated with open tax years that are under review and our compliance with reit requirements our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws we estimate our actual current income tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities these estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain nonroutine transactions changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities our inability to qualify as a reit the potential for builtingain recognition changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to taxable reit subsidiaries and changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within income tax expense we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is “morelikelythannot” that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities 

  

derivative financial instruments 

all derivatives are recognized at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets within the line items other assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses  as applicable we do not net our derivative position by counterparty for purposes of balance sheet presentation and disclosure the accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives are designated as and qualify as hedging instruments derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations 

for derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments in accordance with the accounting standards we formally designate and document at inception the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction in addition we formally assess both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures any ineffective portion of a derivative financial instrument’s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and may be used to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and variable interest rates but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements 

changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures hedged fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments will generally be offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged the changes in fair values of derivatives that were not designated andor did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings for cash flow hedges we reclassify changes in the fair value of derivatives into the applicable line item in our consolidated statements of operations in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period that the underlying hedged items affect earnings 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

funds from operations “ffo” 

ffo is a nongaap measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings although the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” has published a definition of ffo modifications to the nareit calculation of ffo are common among reits as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business 

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor do we intend it to present a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance we believe net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap further we believe our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition and our operating performance 

nareit’s ffo measure adjusts net earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales along with impairment charges of previously depreciated properties we agree that these nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

  

 our ffo measures 

at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community” we believe stockholders potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating results are best served by a defined ffo measure 

  

that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of ffo our ffo measures are used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe that it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses 

we use these ffo measures including by segment and region to i evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv assess our performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general and v evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a longterm outlook we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of shortterm items that we do not expect to affect the underlying longterm performance of the properties the longterm performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income while not infrequent or unusual these additional items we exclude in calculating ffo as defined by prologis  are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative shortterm effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our longterm outlook 

we use our ffo measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance we do not use our ffo measures as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap as indicators of our operating performance as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs 

ffo as defined by prologis 

to arrive at ffo as defined by prologis  we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude 

 

  

  

  

  

 we calculate ffo as defined by prologis for our unconsolidated entities on the same basis as we calculate our ffo as defined by prologis  

we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy 

core ffo 

in addition to ffo as defined by prologis we also use core ffo  to arrive at core ffo we adjust ffo as defined by prologis  to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly or our share recognized by our unconsolidated entities to the extent they are included in ffo as defined by prologis  

 

       we believe it is appropriate to further adjust our ffo as defined by prologis for certain recurring items as they were driven by transactional activity and factors relating to the financial and real estate markets rather than factors specific to the ongoing operating performance of our properties or investments the impairment charges we recognized were primarily based on valuations of real estate which had declined due to market conditions that we no longer expected to hold for longterm investment we currently have and have had over the past several years a stated priority to strengthen our financial position we expect to accomplish this by reducing our debt our investment in certain low yielding assets such as land that we decide not to develop and our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations as a result we have sold to third parties or contributed to unconsolidated entities real estate properties that depending on market conditions might result in a gain or loss the impairment charges related to goodwill and other assets that we have recognized were similarly caused by the decline in the real estate markets also in connection with our stated priority to reduce debt and extend debt maturities we have purchased portions of our debt securities as a result we recognized net gains or losses on the early extinguishment of certain debt due to the financial market conditions at that time 

we have also adjusted for some nonrecurring items the merger acquisition and other integration expenses include costs we incurred in 2011 and 2012 associated with the merger and pepr acquisition and the integration of our systems and processes we have not adjusted for the 

  

acquisition costs that we have incurred as a result of routine acquisitions but only the costs associated with significant business combinations that we would expect to be infrequent in nature similarly the expenses related to the natural disaster in japan that we recognized in 2011 are a rare occurrence but we may incur similar expenses again in the future 

we analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental income of our real estate and the revenue driven by our private capital business net of operating administrative and financing expenses this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities as a result although these items have had a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the longterm 

we use core ffo  including by segment and region to i evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance v assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general and vi evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a longterm outlook we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of items that we do not expect to affect the underlying longterm performance of the properties we own as noted above we believe the longterm performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy 

limitations on use of our ffo measures 

while we believe our defined ffo measures are important supplemental measures neither nareit’s nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are therefore limited as an analytical tool accordingly they are two of many measures we use when analyzing our business some of these limitations are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions this information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap to assist investors in compensating for these limitations we reconcile our defined ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap for the years ended december 31 as follows in thousands 

 

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreignexchange related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments we have used certain derivative financial instruments primarily foreign currency put option and forward contracts to reduce our foreign currency market risk as we deem appropriate we have also used interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate market risk we do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with established policies and procedures 

we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in year end interest rates the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates the failure to hedge effectively against exchange and interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to achieve this objective we primarily borrow on a fixed rate basis for longerterm debt issuances as of december 31 2012 we had a total of 33 billion of variable rate debt outstanding of which 09 billion was outstanding on our credit facilities 06 billion was outstanding under a multicurrency senior term loan and 18 billion was outstanding secured mortgage debt as of december 31 2012 we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix 13 billion of our variable rate secured mortgage debt 

our primary interest rate risk not subject to interest rate swap agreements is created by the variable rate credit facilities senior term loan and selected secured mortgage debt during the year ended december 31 2012 we had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of 12 billion on our variable rate debt not subject to interest rate swap agreements based on the results of a sensitivity analysis assuming a 10 adverse change in interest rates based on our outstanding balances during the period the impact was 20 million which equates to a change in interest rates of 17 basis points 

  

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates to the translation of the net income and net investment of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollar principally euro british pound sterling and japanese yen especially to the extent we wish to repatriate funds to the united states to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate we also may use foreign currency put option contracts or other forms of hedging instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the projected net operating income or net equity of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated entities hedging arrangements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency the funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of foreign currency the failure to hedge effectively against exchange and interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position we may experience fluctuations in our earnings as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in fourth quarter 2012 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts that expire in april 2013 with an aggregate notional amount of €10 billion 13 billion using the forward rate of 130 to further hedge a portion of our investment in europe at a fixed euro rate in us dollars based on a sensitivity analysis a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against the euro by 10 would result in a 1300 million positive or negative change respectively in our cash flows upon settlement of the forward contract these derivatives were designated and qualify as hedging instruments and therefore the changes in fair value of these derivatives will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets we may enter into similar agreements in the future to further hedge our investment in europe or other jurisdictions 

we also have some exposure to movements in exchange rates related to certain intercompany loans we issue from time to time and we may use foreign currency forward contracts to manage these risks at december 31 2012 we had no forward contracts outstanding and therefore we may experience fluctuations in our earnings from the remeasurement of these intercompany loans due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates

merger of amb and prologis and acquisition of pepr 

on june 3 2011 amb property corporation “amb” completed the merger with prologis a maryland reit “prologis” in which prologis shareholders received 04464 of a share of common stock of amb for each outstanding common share of beneficial interest in prologis the “merger following the merger amb changed its name to prologis inc in the merger amb was the legal acquirer and prologis was the accounting acquirer in may 2011 we also acquired a controlling interest in and began consolidating prologis european properties “pepr” the “pepr acquisition” 

we have recorded the purchase price allocations for both the merger 59 billion and pepr acquisition 16 billion in our december 31 2011 consolidated balance sheet our results for 2011 reflect approximately seven months of the impact of the merger and the pepr acquisition therefore period to period comparisons may not be meaningful see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information relating to both the merger and pepr acquisition 

investment strategy 

we believe that gross domestic product “gdp” growth and growth in global trade are important drivers of demand for our product trade and gdp are correlated as higher levels of investment production and consumption within a globalized economy are consistent with increased levels of imports and exports as the world produces and consumes more we believe that the volume of global trade will continue to increase at a rate in excess of growth in global gdp significant supply chain reconfiguration obsolescence and customers’ preference to lease rather than own facilities also drive demand for quality distribution space 

our investment strategy focuses on providing distribution and logistics space to customers whose businesses are tied to global trade and depend on the efficient movement of goods through the global supply chain to support global trade we have a deep global presence with assets under management of 438 billion spanning 22 countries on four continents our properties are primarily located in two main market categories global markets and regional markets global markets comprise approximately 30 of the largest markets tied to global trade these markets feature large population centers with high percapita consumption rates and are located near major airports seaports and ground transportation systems similar to global markets regional markets benefit from large population centers but typically are not as tied to the global supply chain and are often less supply constrained as of december 31 2011 global and regional markets represented approximately 83 and 12 respectively of our overall owned and managed platform based on our share of net operating income of the properties approximately 5 of our total portfolio falls in markets that we do not classify as global or regional markets our investment strategy would be to exit these other markets over time our portfolio allows us to have local market knowledge construction expertise and a commitment to sustainable design we are supported by a broad and diverse customer base comprising relationships with multinational corporations that result in repeatable business 

business strategy 

our business strategy focuses on three principal lines of business within two business segments as follows 

real estate operations segment 

rental operations  this represents the primary source of our core revenue earnings and funds from operations or ffo as defined in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition” we collect rent from our customers under operating leases including reimbursements for the vast majority of our operating costs we seek to generate longterm internal growth in rents by maintaining a high occupancy rate at our properties by controlling expenses and through contractual rent increases on existing space and renewals on rollover space thus capitalizing on the economies of scale inherent in owning operating and growing a large global portfolio our rental income is diversified due to both our global presence and our broad customer base we expect to increase overall rental income primarily through the leasing of space currently available in our properties we believe that our regular maintenance programs capital expenditure programs energy management and sustainability programs create cost efficencies that provide a benefit to our customers as well as the company 

capital deployment activities  our development and redevelopment activities support our rental operations and are therefore included with that line of business for segment reporting we develop and redevelop industrial properties primarily in global and regional markets to meet our customers’ needs within this line of business we provide additional value creation by utilizing i the land that we currently own in global and regional markets ii the development expertise of our local personnel iii our global customer relationships and iv the demand for high quality distribution facilities in key markets we seek to increase our rental income and the net asset value of the company through the leasing of newly developed space as well as through the acquisition of new properties depending on several factors we may develop properties directly or in coinvestment ventures for longterm hold for contribution into one of our coinvestment ventures or for sale to third parties properties that we choose to contribute or sell may result in the recognition of gains or losses generally in the us europe and japan we are developing directly while in emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico we are developing with our private capital partners in a variety of coinvestment ventures 

private capital segment  we coinvest in properties with private capital investors through a variety of coinvestment ventures we have a direct and longstanding relationship with a significant number of institutional investors we tailor industrial portfolios to investors’ specific 

  

needs and deploy capital in both closeended and openended structures while providing complete portfolio management and financial reporting services we generally own 1050 in the ventures we believe our coinvestment in each of our ventures provides a strong alignment of interests with our coinvestment partners’ interests we generate revenues from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures by providing asset management and property management services we may also earn revenues through additional services provided such as leasing acquisition construction development disposition legal and tax services depending on the structure of the venture and the returns provided to our partners we may also earn revenues through incentive returns or promotes we believe our coinvestment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a source of capital for new investments and provide revenues for our stockholders as well as mitigate risk associated with our foreign currency exposure we expect to grow this business with the formation of new ventures and by raising additional thirdparty capital in our existing ventures 

our operating segments 

as discussed above our current business strategy includes two operating segments real estate operations which includes our capital deployment activities and private capital our real estate operations segment represents the longterm ownership of industrial operating properties including development activities our private capital segment represents the longterm management of coinvestment ventures and the properties they own please see “item 1a risk factors” our property information and market presence as presented in “item 2 properties” a discussion of our segment results in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and our segment footnote – note22 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information with regard to the investments and results of operations of our segments 

competition 

the existence of competitively priced distribution space available in any market could have a material impact on our ability to rent space and on the rents that we can charge to the extent we wish to acquire land for future development of properties in our real estate operations segment or dispose of land we may compete with local regional and national developers we also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital 

we believe we have competitive advantages due to i our ability to respond quickly to customers’ needs for highquality distribution space in key global distribution markets ii our established relationships with key customers served by our local personnel iii our ability to leverage our organizational structure to provide a single point of contact for our global customers through our global customer solutions team iv our property management and leasing expertise v our relationships and proven track record with current and prospective investors in our private capital business vi our global experience in the development and management of industrial properties vii the strategic locations of our land that we expect to develop and viii our personnel who are experienced in the land entitlement process 

customers 

we have developed a customer base that is diverse in terms of industry concentration and represents a broad spectrum of international national regional and local distribution space users at december 31 2011 in our real estate operations segment we had 3163 customers occupying 2660 million square feet of distribution space in the unconsolidated properties we manage we had 2476 customers occupying 2493 million square feet of distribution space in our real estate operations segment our largest customer and 25 largest customers accounted for 06 and 72 respectively of our annualized base rent at december 31 2011 

within our global customer solutions team we develop longterm relationships with our customers and understand their business and needs serving as their strategic partner for real estate on a global basis keeping in close contact with customers and focusing on exceptional customer service sets us apart from other real estate providers as much more than a landlord we believe that what we offer in terms of scope scale and quality of assets is unique our indepth knowledge of our markets helps us stay ahead of trends and create forwardthinking solutions for their distribution networks this depth of customer knowledge results in greater retention and expanded service which garners additional business from the same customer across multiple geographies approximately 500  of our annual base rent is derived from customers who lease from us in more than one location and more than one country 

in our private capital segment we consider our private capital investors to be our customers as of december 31 2011 we partnered with 117 investors several of which invest in multiple funds 

employees 

we employ 1457 persons in our entire organization our employees work in four countries in the americas 925 persons in 15 countries in europe 345 persons and in three countries in asia 187 persons of the total we have assigned 862 employees to our real estate operations segment and 67 employees to our private capital segment we have 528 employees who work in corporate and support positions who are not assigned to a segment who may assist with segment activities we believe our relationships with our employees are good our employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements although some of our employees in europe are represented by statutory works councils and benefit from applicable labor agreements 

management’s overview 

at the time of the merger we established key strategic priorities to guide our path over the next two years these priorities are 

 

   

  

  

  

 align our portfolio with our investment strategy 

subsequent to the merger we performed a comprehensive review of our owned and managed portfolio and categorized the portfolio into three main segments – global regional and other markets global markets represent approximately 83 of our overall owned and managed platform based on our share of net operating income of the properties regional markets represent 12 of our total owned and managed platform we intend to hold only the highest quality classa product in our regional markets we also own a small number of assets in other markets which account for 5 of our owned and managed platform and that we plan to exit from in an orderly fashion in the next few years by segmenting our markets in this manner we were able to construct a strategy that includes culling the portfolio for buildings and potentially submarkets that are no longer a strategic fit for the company we expect to use the proceeds from dispositions to pay down debt and to recycle capital into new development projects or strategic acquisitions 

strengthen our financial position 

we intend to further strengthen our financial position by lowering our financial risk and currency exposure and building one of the strongest balance sheets in the reit industry we expect to lower our financial risk by reducing leverage and maintaining staggered debt maturities which will provide us with more financial flexibility and allow continued access to debt capital markets this financial flexibility will position us to capitalize on market opportunities across the entire business cycle as they become available we expect to lower our currency exposure by owning assets outside the us primarily in coinvestment ventures in which we maintain an ownership interest and provide services generating private capital revenue we will accomplish this through contributions and sales to our existing and newly formed coinvestment ventures in addition we expect that new development projects particularly in emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico will be done in conjunction with our private capital partners we will also reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations by borrowing in local currencies when appropriate 

streamline private capital business 

we are rationalizing our private capital business in conjunction with our private capital investors some of our coinvestment ventures have fee structures that do not adequately compensate us for the services we provide therefore we may terminate or restructure certain of these coinvestment ventures in other cases we may combine some coinvestment ventures to gain operational efficiencies in every case however we will work very closely with our partners and venture investors who will be active participants in these decisions we plan to grow our private capital business with the deployment of the private capital commitments we have already raised formation of new coinvestment ventures and raising incremental capital for our existing coinvestment ventures 

improve the utilization of our low yielding assets 

we plan to increase the value of our low yielding assets by stabilizing our operating portfolio to its historical average of 95 leased completing the buildout and leaseup of our development projects as well as monetizing our land through development or sale to third parties 

build the most effective and efficient organization in the reit industry and become the employer of choice among top professionals interested in real estate as a career 

we have identified more than 115 million of merger cost synergies on an annualized basis as compared to the combined expenses of amb and prologis on a premerger basis these synergies include gross general and administrative savings reduced global line of credit facility fees and lower amortization of non real estate assets we believe we have realized approximately 90 of these synergies already and expect to realize the full amount by year  end 2012 in addition we are in the process of implementing a new enterprise wide system that will include a property managementbilling system a human resources system a general ledger and accounting system and a data warehouse in connection with this implementation we are striving to utilize the most effective global business processes with the enhanced system functionality we have implemented two new compensation plans that we believe will better align employees’ compensation to our performance we believe these efforts and others will help us with the attainment of this objective 

see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of our 2011 results and progress attaining the objectives outlined above 

code of ethics and business conduct 

we maintain a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to our board and all of our officers and employees including the principal coexecutive officers the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer or persons performing similar functions a copy of our code of ethics and business conduct is available on our website wwwprologiscom in addition to being accessible through our website copies of our code of ethics and business conduct can be obtained free of charge upon written request to investor relations pier 1 bay 1 san francisco california 94111 any amendments to or waivers of our code of ethics and business conduct that apply to the principal 

  

executive officers the principal financial officer or the principal accounting officer or persons performing similar functions and that relate to any matter enumerated in item 406b of regulation sk will be disclosed on our website 

environmental matters 

we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition either the previous owners or we subjected a majority of the properties we have acquired including land to environmental reviews while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 and “item 1a risk factors” 

insurance coverage 

we carry insurance coverage on our properties we determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets such coverages include property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy named windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance self insurance and through a whollyowned captive insurance entity we believe that our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured however an uninsured loss could result in loss of capital investment and anticipated revenues and earnings see further discussion in “item 1a risk factors” 




 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations distributable cash flow and value of our securities these risks include among others 

general 

disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

global market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth in most major economies during the last few years although signs of recovery may exist there are continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation the availability and cost of credit a lagging real estate market and geopolitical issues that contribute to increased market volatility and uncertain expectations for the global economy to the extent there is turmoil in the financial markets it has the potential to materially affect the value of our properties and investments in our unconsolidated investees the availability or the terms of financing that we and our unconsolidated investees have or may anticipate utilizing our ability and that of our unconsolidated investees to make principal and interest payments on or refinance any outstanding debt when due and may impact the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases 

the market volatility over the last several years has made the valuation of our properties and those of our unconsolidated investees more difficult there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation or in the stability of the value of our properties and those of our unconsolidated investees that could result in a decrease in the value of our properties and those of our unconsolidated investees as a result we may not be able to recover the current carrying amount of our investments in real estate properties including our unconsolidated investees which may require us to recognize an impairment charge in earnings in addition to the charges we previously recognized 

any additional continued or recurring disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

as a global company we are subject to social political and economic risks of doing business in many countries 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states during 2011 we generated approximately 419 or 642 million of our revenue from operations outside the united states circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 our global growth including growth in new regions in the united states also subjects us to certain risks including risks associated with funding increasing headcount integrating new offices and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar laws 

although we have committed substantial resources to expand our global platform if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

in addition our international operations and specifically the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt may be affected by currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other things 

the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the functional currency at december 31 2011 approximately 435 or 121 billion of our total assets are invested in a currency other than the us dollar primarily the euro japanese yen and british pound sterling as a result we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our financial position debt covenant ratios and results of operations although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and on occasion and when deemed appropriate using derivative contracts there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets which may reduce economic returns to investors 

real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions in addition significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as secured mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments like other companies qualifying as reits under the internal revenue code we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable reit subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property while we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment in order to generate liquidity if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale we may not pursue such sales 

in the event that we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation divesting ourselves of properties whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term at less than optimal terms incurring debt entering into leases with our customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates at turnover there can be no assurance however that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us additionally taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

risks related to our business 

general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results 

we are exposed to general economic conditions local regional national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties 

as of december 31 2011 approximately 230 of our consolidated operating properties or 49 billion based on investment before depreciation are located in california which represented 188 of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 208 of our annualized base rent our revenue from and the value of our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing industry 

  

slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california’s economic climate because of the number of properties we have located in california a downturn in california’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

in addition to california we also have significant holdings defined as more than 3 of total investment before depreciation in operating properties in certain global and regional markets located in chicago dallasfort worth france japan new jerseynew york city south florida and the united kingdom our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties conditions such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space among other factors may impact operating conditions any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction in demand for distribution space could adversely affect our results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of our securities 

in addition our unconsolidated investees have concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above as well as in markets in central and eastern pennsylvania germany mexico poland and reno and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets 

a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity us properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the san francisco bay area los angeles and seattle international properties located in active seismic areas include japan and mexico we generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to self insure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis we have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for wholly owned assets in japan based on this analysis 

further a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane andor flood risk we carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants 

our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses 

we and our unconsolidated investees currently carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy namely windstorm flood earthquake and terrorism commercial general liability insurance and environmental insurance as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets we believe our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated investees are adequately insured however there are certain losses including losses from floods earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property 

furthermore we cannot be sure that our insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if our insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and if there is recourse debt then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business 

investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio market research and our property management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated some of the factors that may affect real estate values include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 our investments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector 

our investments in real estate assets are primarily concentrated in the industrial distribution sector this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified 

our operating results and distributable cash flow will depend on the continued generation of lease revenues from customers and we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or release space on favorable terms as leases expire 

our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations we are also subject to the risk that upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties leases may not be renewed by existing customers the space may not be released to new customers or the terms of renewal or releasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers we may lose potential customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain customers when our customers’ leases expire in the event of default by a significant number of customers we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord and may be unable to release spaces a customer may experience a downturn in its business which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease in addition a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow 

if we decide to contribute or sell properties to an unconsolidated investee or third parties to generate proceeds we may not be successful 

we may contribute or sell properties to certain of our unconsolidated investees or third parties on a casebycase basis our ability to sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties market conditions including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties and other factors beyond our control if our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets andor at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or on favorable terms or at all the unconsolidated investee or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital in the private and public markets in order to acquire properties from us should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then dispositions could be delayed if we are unable to generate proceeds through property sales we may have to delay our deleveraging plans which may result in adverse effects on our liquidity distributable cash flow debt covenant ratios and the value of our securities 

we may acquire properties which involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results and the value of our securities 

we may acquire industrial properties the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates when we acquire properties we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures additionally there is and it is expected there will continue to be significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities 

our real estate development strategies may not be successful 

our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through sales to third parties development of industrial properties to hold for longterm investment or contribution or sale to an unconsolidated investee depending on market conditions our liquidity needs and other factors we may expand investment in our development renovation and redevelopment business and we will complete the buildout and leasing of our development platform we may also develop renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed development coinvestment ventures the real estate development renovation and redevelopment business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities which include the following risks 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our operating results and financial condition 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination 

environmental laws in some countries including the united states also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of our properties are known to contain asbestoscontaining building materials 

in addition some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances further certain of our properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in connection with certain divested properties we have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties 

we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the presence of such substances on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow 

we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming coinvestment ventures investing in new or existing coinvestment ventures attracting third party investment and investing in and managing properties through coinvestment ventures 

as of december 31 2011 we have an investment in approximately 2778 million square feet held through unconsolidated investees our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in unconsolidated investees and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through coinvestment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances however there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new coinvestment ventures attract third party investment or make additional investments in new or existing coinvestment ventures successfully develop or acquire properties through unconsolidated entities or realize value from such unconsolidated entities our inability to do so may have an adverse effect on our growth our earnings and the market price of our securities 

our partners in our unconsolidated investments may share certain approval rights over major decisions and some partners may manage the properties in the unconsolidated investees our unconsolidated investments involve certain risks including 

 

   

  

  

  

 we generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our unconsolidated investees to permit us to achieve our business objectives however we may not be able to do so and the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities 

contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have acquired and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties then we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it which could adversely affect our cash flow contingent or unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include 

 

  

  

  

  

 risks related to financing and capital 

we face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business activities including refinancing and interest rate risks and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to make required payments on our debt or are unable to refinance our debt 

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected and if the maturing debt is secured the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness our global senior credit agreement yenbased credit agreement and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements in addition our unconsolidated investees may be unable to refinance indebtedness or meet payment obligations which may impact our distributable cash flow and our financial condition andor we may be required to recognize impairment charges of our investments 

covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition 

the terms of our various credit agreements including our global senior credit agreement and yenbased credit agreement the indentures under which our senior notes are issued and other note agreements require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage leverage ratios fixed charge ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness if we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition could be adversely affected 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity 

the credit ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect 

  

the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing also a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our refinancing and other capital market activities our ability to manage debt maturities our future growth our financial condition the market price of our securities and our development and acquisition activity 

we are dependent on external sources of capital 

in order to qualify as a reit we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain and we may be subject to tax to the extent our income is not fully distributed while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances our own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december 31 2011 and in some cases declared as late as december 31 2012 the reit can satisfy up to 90 of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital further in order to maintain our reit status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities 

federal income tax risks 

our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences 

the reit elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code commencing with the taxable year ended december 31 1997 we believe we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit however it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a reit or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex sections of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control for example in order to qualify as a reit the reit must derive at least 95 of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of the reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis the provisions of the internal revenue code and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a reit are more complicated in our case because we hold assets through the operating partnership 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on taxable income at regular corporate rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification if we lost our reit status our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved 

furthermore we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit gross income tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to united states federal income tax in addition a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties including by contributing properties to our coinvestment ventures under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions while we believe that the internal revenue service 

  

would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 

legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax taws applicable to investments in reits and similar entities additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders 

risks relating to the merger 

the combined company may be unable to integrate its businesses successfully and realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits of the merger or do so within the anticipated timeframe 

on june 3 2011 amb and prologis completed the merger the merger involved a combination of two companies that previously operated as independent public companies each of which operated its own private capital platform focused on the industrial real estate sector and served as the sponsor or manager of or in a similar capacity with respect to numerous private equity investment vehicles 

the combined company is required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the constituent companies potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 for all these reasons it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of our management the disruption of our ongoing business or the diversion of our resources to the integration process as we attempt to complete the integration process any of which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market price of our securities 

other risks 

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees from time to time our personnel and their roles may change in connection with the completion of the merger there were changes to our personnel and their roles while we believe that we have retained our key talent and can find suitable employees to meet our personnel needs the loss of key personnel any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market price of our securities if we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs 

under the americans with disabilities act places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants if we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the americans with disabilities act including removing access barriers then our cash flow and the amounts available to make distributions and payments to our security holders may be adversely affected our properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and lifesafety requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements while we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

we are subject to governmental regulations and actions that affect operating results and financial condition 

many laws including tax laws and governmental regulations apply to us our unconsolidated investees and our properties changes in these laws and governmental regulations or their interpretation by agencies or the courts could occur which might affect our ability to conduct business 

  

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations restatements of our financial statements a decline in the price of our securities or otherwise materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate change related risks 

we consider that we are exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate our distribution facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events such as severe storms andor floods if the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change our exposure to these events could increase 

we do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change as our operations do not emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases however we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain andor stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings

 item 2 properties 

we are invested in real estate properties that are primarily generic industrial properties in japan our industrial properties are generally multilevel centers which is common in japan due to the high cost and limited availability of land our properties are typically used for distribution storage packaging assembly and light manufacturing of consumer and industrial products based on the square footage of the operating properties included in our real estate operations segment at december 31 2011 and discussed below our properties are 100 industrial properties including 925 used for bulk distribution 44 used for light manufacturing and assembly 13 used for flex industrial 10 used for ontarmac and 08 used for other purposes 

geographic distribution 

our investment strategy focuses on providing distribution and logistics space to customers whose businesses are tied to global trade and depend on the efficient movement of goods through the global supply chain our properties are primarily located in two main market types global markets and regional markets global markets account for 854 of our consolidated operating properties based on investment balance and comprise approximately 30 of the largest and most liquid markets tied to global trade these markets feature large population centers with high percapita consumption rates and close proximity to airports seaports and ground transportation systems regional markets account for 106 of our consolidated operating properties similar to global markets regional markets benefit from large population centers but typically are not as tied to the global supply chain and are often less supply constrained 

  

the information in the following tables is as of december 31 2011 for our consolidated operating properties properties in our development portfolio and land including 375 buildings owned by entities we consolidate but of which we own less than 100 all of these assets are included in our real estate operations segment this includes our portfolio of operating properties we developed or are currently developing no individual property or group of properties operating as a single business unit amounted to 10 or more of our consolidated total assets at december 31 2011 or generated income equal to 10 or more of our consolidated gross revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 these tables do not include properties that are owned by unconsolidated investees 

 

   

  

   

 the following is a summary of our investment in consolidated real estate properties at december 31 2011 

 

  

  

  

  

 unconsolidated coinvestment ventures 

at december 31 2011 we had an investment in properties through our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures that we also managed of 1403 properties with 2678 million square feet and a total entity investment of 213 billion see further discussion in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we and our unconsolidated investees are parties to a variety of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business we believe that with respect to any such matters that we are currently a party to the ultimate disposition of any such matter will not result in a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations 

in december 2011 arbitration hearings began in connection with a dispute related to a real estate development project known as pacific commons the plaintiff cisco technology inc “cisco” is seeking rescission of a 2007 restructuring and settlement agreement the “contract” and other agreements and declaratory relief and damages for breach of the contract specifically cisco seeks 1 declaratory relief that prologis owes certain community facilities district taxes that have been assessed against cisco’s land following cisco’s purchase of the land from prologis through the exercise of option agreements 2 declaratory relief that prologis’ partial transfers of rights and obligations under the contract to third parties are void and 3 damages for alleged breaches of the contract relating to the plans to build a baseball stadium at pacific commons although the total damages alleged by cisco are approximately 200 million we believe these claims are without merit and are defending these matters vigorously based on the facts and circumstances surrounding this dispute we believe the low end of our range of loss is zero and therefore in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we have not recorded any liability with respect to this matter as of december 31 2011

dividends 

in order to comply with the reit requirements of the internal revenue code we are generally required to make common and preferred stock dividends other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders in amounts that together at least equal i the sum of a 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains and b 90 of the net income after tax if any from foreclosure property minus ii certain excess noncash income our common stock distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow that ensures that we will meet the distribution requirements of the internal revenue code and that allows us to also retain cash to meet other needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities 

prior to the merger prologis paid a cash distribution of 01125 per common share or 025 after being adjusted by the merger exchange ratio for the first quarter on february 28 2011 and for the second quarter on may 25 2011 also prior to the merger amb paid a dividend of 028 per common share on february 28 2011 for the first quarter and on may 25 2011 for the second quarter neither amb dividend has been reflected in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 since prologis is considered the accounting acquirer as discussed earlier we paid a cash distribution of 028 per common share for the third quarter on september 30 2011 and for the fourth quarter on december 29 2011 our future common stock dividends may vary and will be determined by our board of directors “board” upon the circumstances prevailing at the time including our financial condition operating results and reit distribution requirements and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year 

in addition to common stock at december 31 2011 we had seven series of preferred stock outstanding “series l preferred stock” “series m preferred stock” “series o preferred stock” “series p preferred stock” “series q preferred stock” “series r preferred stock” and “series s preferred stock” the series q r and s preferred stock was issued in connection with the merger and exchanged for the outstanding c f and g cumulative redeemable preferred shares of beneficial interest in prologis respectively

 prologis inc is a selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust and is the sole general partner of prologis lp we operate the reit and the operating partnership as one enterprise and therefore our discussion and analysis refers to the reit and its consolidated subsidiaries including the operating partnership collectively 

on june 3 2011 we completed the merger in which prologis shareholders received 04464 of a share of amb common stock for each outstanding common share of beneficial interest in prologis following the merger amb changed its name to prologis inc in the merger amb was the legal acquirer and prologis was the accounting acquirer therefore premerger activity included in the management discussion and analysis is the activity of prologis and does not include amb results until june 3 2011 in may 2011 we also acquired a controlling interest in and began consolidating pepr we have recorded the purchase price allocations for both the merger of 59 billion and pepr acquisition of 16 billion in our december 31 2011 consolidated balance sheet our results for 2011 reflect approximately seven months of the impact of the merger and the pepr acquisition therefore period to period comparisons may not provide as meaningful of information as if those transactions were reflected in both periods as a result of this merger we have identified more than 115 million on an annualized basis of merger cost synergies as compared to the combined expenses of amb and prologis on a premerger basis these synergies include gross general and administrative savings reduced global line of credit facility fees and lower amortization of non real estate assets we believe we have realized approximately 90 of these synergies already and expect to realize the full amount by yearend 2012 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information relating to both the merger and pepr acquisition 

business strategy 

our current business strategy includes two operating segments real estate operations and private capital 

we generate revenues earnings net operating income and funds from operations both as defined below and cash flows through our segments primarily through three lines of business as follows 

real estate operations segment 

rental operations  this represents the primary source of our core revenue earnings and funds from operations or ffo as defined below we collect rent from our customers under operating leases including reimbursements for the vast majority of our operating costs we seek to generate longterm internal growth in rents by maintaining a high occupancy rate at our properties by controlling expenses and through contractual rent increases on existing space and renewals on rollover space thus capitalizing on the economies of scale inherent in owning operating and growing a large global portfolio our rental income is diversified due to both our global presence and our broad customer base we expect to increase overall rental income primarily through the leasing of space currently available in our properties we believe that our regular maintenance programs capital expenditure programs energy management and sustainability programs create cost efficiencies that provide a benefit to our customers as well as the company 

capital deployment activities  our development and redevelopment activities support our rental operations and are therefore included with that line of business for segment reporting we develop and redevelop industrial properties primarily in global and regional markets to meet our customers’ needs within this line of business we provide additional value creation by utilizing i the land that we currently own in global and regional markets ii the development expertise of our local personnel iii our global customer relationships and iv the demand for high quality distribution facilities in key markets we seek to increase our rental income and the net asset value of the company through the leasing of newly developed space as well as through the acquisition of new properties depending on several factors we may develop properties directly or in coinvestment ventures for longterm hold for contribution into one of our coinvestment ventures or for sale to third parties properties that we choose to contribute or sell may result in the recognition of gains or losses generally in the us europe and japan we are developing directly while in emerging markets such as brazil china and mexico we are developing with our private capital partners in a variety of coinvestment ventures 

private capital segment we coinvest in properties with private capital investors through a variety of coinvestment ventures we have a direct and longstanding relationship with a significant number of institutional investors we tailor industrial portfolios to investors’ specific needs and deploy capital in both closeended and openended structures while providing complete portfolio management and financial reporting services we generally own 1050 in the ventures we believe our coinvestment in each of our ventures provides a strong alignment of interests with our coinvestment partners’ interests we generate revenues from our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures by providing asset management and property management services we may also earn revenues through additional services provided such as leasing acquisition construction development disposition legal and tax services depending on the structure of the venture and the returns provided to our partners we may also earn revenues through incentive returns or promotes we believe our coinvestment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a source of capital for new investments and provide revenues for our stockholders as well as mitigate risk associated with our foreign currency exposure we expect to grow this business with the formation of new ventures and by raising additional thirdparty capital in our existing ventures 

in 2009 we recognized income in the cdfs business segment related to gains from the japan property funds that were deferred upon original contributions and triggered with the sale of our investments we no longer have a cdfs business segment 

  

summary of 2011 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we completed the following activities in support of our strategic priorities 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 operational outlook 

despite the ongoing slowdown in the global economic recovery fourthquarter real estate fundamentals in the us industrial markets continued to improve consistent with the improvement we saw in the third quarter though down from its rebound thirdquarter level net absorption of us industrial space measured 28 million square feet in the fourth quarter net absorption has been positive for the last six consecutive quarters reducing the availability rate by 90 basis points during that time at 136 availability is at its lowest level since the second quarter of 2009 net effective rent has made modest improvements and as a result some speculative development is beginning in selected locations such as miami washington dc seattle southern california and houston 

though economic growth remains relatively moderate inventories continue to rise and utilization rates have been on an overall upward trajectory since late 2010 in the us net absorption totaled more than 117 million square feet in 2011 representing a remarkable improvement over the past few years and we expect net absorption of 150  175 million square feet in 2012 

within europe and japan we believe significant supply chain reconfiguration the ongoing globalization of central and eastern europe obsolescence and strong tenant preference to rent rather than own will fuel additional demand for industrial space moreover the undersupply of classa distribution space in japan has and will continue to create demand for more modern earthquakeresistant product especially as japan rebuilds and regroups from the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami which temporarily interrupted its supply chain demand in emerging markets where we have investments primarily through our coinvestment ventures such as brazil china and mexico remains strong 

in our total owned and managed operating portfolio which includes properties managed by us and owned by our unconsolidated coinvestment ventures that are accounted for under the equity method and including properties that were part of the merger we leased 1388 million square feet of space in 2011 excluding the properties that were part of the merger we leased 1194 million square feet of space during the year ended december 31 2010 the effective rental rates on leases signed during the fourth quarter of 2011 in our same store portfolio as defined below decreased by 45 when compared with the rental rates on the previous leases on that same space the total owned and managed portfolio was 922 occupied at december 31 2011 up from 890 at december 31 2010 our existing customers renewed their leases 747 of the time in 2011 as compared with 795 in 2010 

we believe that capital deployment opportunities are increasing and we are currently evaluating multiple opportunities in our global and regional markets around the globe our development business consists of speculative development buildtosuit development value added coversions and redevelopment we expect to develop directly and within the coinvestment structures depending on location market conditions submarkets or building sites and availability of capital we believe that developing redeveloping andor expanding of welllocated highquality industrial properties provides higher rates of return than may be obtained from purchasing existing properties however development projects may require significant management attention and capital investment to maximize returns during 2011 in response to this emerging demand we including prologis amb premerger and unconsolidated entities commenced development of 42 properties totaling 108 million square feet with a total expected investment of 10 billion of this amount 8635 million is our share and 1532 million is the share of our coinvestment venture partners 

  

results of operations 

summary 

the following table illustrates the net operating income for each of our segments along with the reconciling items to loss from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of operations 

 

 see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our segments and a reconciliation of net operating income to loss before income taxes  

real estate operations segment 

the net operating income of the real estate operations segment consisted of rental income and rental expenses from industrial properties that we own and consolidate and is impacted by our capital deployment activities the size and percentage of occupancy of our consolidated operating portfolio fluctuates due to the timing of acquisitions development activity and contributions such fluctuations affect the net operating income we recognize in this segment in a particular period also included in this segment is revenue from land we own and lease to customers under ground leases and development management and other income offset by acquisition costs and land holding costs as discussed earlier results for 2011 included approximately seven months of rental income and expenses from the properties acquired through the merger and pepr acquisition the results of properties that were sold to third parties are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for all periods and therefore do not impact the segment results the net operating income from the real estate operations segment for the years ended december 31 was as follows in thousands 

 

 the increases in rental income and rental expenses in 2011 from 2010 are due principally to the impact of the merger and the pepr acquisition increased occupancy in our consolidated operating portfolio from 859 at december 31 2010 to 914 at december 31 2011 and the completion and stabilization of new development properties the results for 2011 include approximately seven months of rental income and rental expenses from properties acquired through the merger and pepr acquisition of 5655 million and 1476 million respectively in our consolidated portfolio we leased 634 million square feet in 2011 compared to 573 million square feet in 2010 the increase in net operating income in 2010 over 2009 is due primarily to increased occupancy in the development portfolio we calculate the change in effective rental rates on the previous leases on that same space for leases signed during a quarter based on our same store portfolio as defined below during 2011 over the four quarters the percentage change in rental rates ranged from a decrease of 89 to a decrease of 45 during 2010 over the four quarters the percentage change in rental rates ranged from a decrease of 157 to a decrease of 85 the decrease was due to i leases turning that were put in place when market rents were at or near peak and ii decreased market rents under the terms of our lease agreements we are able to recover the majority of our rental expenses from customers rental expense recoveries included in both rental income and rental expenses were 2831 million 1610 million and 1503 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

our consolidated operating portfolio as of december 31 was as follows square feet in thousands 

 

  

 private capital segment 

the net operating income of the private capital segment consisted of fees and incentives earned for services performed for our unconsolidated investees and certain third parties reduced by our direct costs of managing these entities and the properties they own 

the direct costs associated with our private capital segment totaled 550 million 407 million and 434 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively and are included in the line item private capital expenses in our consolidated statements of operations in item 8 these expenses include the direct expenses associated with the asset management of the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures provided by individuals who are assigned to our private capital segment in addition in order to achieve efficiencies and economies of scale all of our property management functions are provided by a team of professionals who are assigned to our real estate operations segment these individuals perform the propertylevel management of the properties in our owned and managed portfolio including properties we consolidate and the properties we manage that are owned by the unconsolidated investees we allocate the costs of our property management function to the properties we consolidate reported in rental expenses  and the properties owned by the unconsolidated investees included in private capital expenses  by using the square feet owned by the respective portfolios the increase in private capital expenses in 2011 is due to the increased private capital platform and infrastructure that was part of the merger offset partially with a decline in the portion of our property management expenses that are allocated to this segment due to the consolidation of pepr 

the net operating income from the private capital segment for the years ended december 31 was as follows in thousands

cdfs business segment 

net operating income of the cdfs business segment for 2009 was 1802 million as previously discussed our business strategy no longer includes the cdfs business segment the amount in 2009 is the recognition of gains previously deferred from the contribution of properties and recognized due to the sale of our investments in the japan coinvestment venture in february 2009 

  

other components of income 

general and administrative “ga” expense and reduction in workforce “rif” 

ga expenses for the years ended december 31 consisted of the following in thousands 

 

  

 the increase in ga expenses and the various components from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to the merger pepr acquisition and the larger infrastructure associated with our larger company overall ga expense decreased from 2009 to 2010 due to lower gross ga expense as a result of the rif program in 2009 and various cost savings measures offset by lower capitalized ga 

merger acquisition and other integration expenses 

in connection with the merger and other related activities we have incurred significant transaction integration and transitional costs these costs include investment banker advisory fees legal tax accounting and valuation fees termination and severance costs both cash and stock based compensation awards for terminated and transitional employees system conversion costs and other integration costs these costs are expensed as incurred the costs that were obligations of amb and expensed premerger are not included in our consolidated financial statements at the time of the merger we terminated our existing credit facilities and wroteoff the remaining unamortized deferred loan costs associated with such facilities which are included as a merger expense in addition we have included costs associated with the acquisition of a controlling interest in pepr and the reduction in workforce charges associated with dispositions made in 2011 we expect to continue to recognize costs primarily compensation and severance costs for transitional employees and system conversion and implementation costs through the end of 2012 as incurred the following is a breakdown of the costs incurred during 2011 in thousands 

 

 the majority of the costs incurred in 2011 were incurred during the second quarter of 2011 when the merger and the pepr acquisition were completed 

impairment of real estate properties 

during 2011 2010 and 2009 we recognized impairment charges of real estate properties in continuing operations of 212 million 7366 million and 3316 million respectively due to our change of intent to no longer hold these assets for longterm investment in 2010 the charges primarily included land as a result of our change in strategy changes in economic and operating conditions and our ultimate investment intent with regard to our investments in real estate that occur in the future may result in additional impairment charges or gains at the time of sale see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more detail on the process we took to value these assets and the related impairments taken 

depreciation and amortization expense 

depreciation and amortization expense was 5853 million 3113 million and 2664 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the properties acquired through the merger and pepr acquisition including intangible assets completed and leased development properties and increased leasing activity the increase from 2009 to 2010 is due to the completion retention and leasing of our developed properties 

  

interest expense 

interest expense from continued operations included the following components in thousands for the years ended december 31 

 

 gross interest expense increased in 2011 from 2010 due primarily to higher debt levels as a result of the merger and pepr acquisition offset partially by decreased interest rates the decrease in capitalized amounts in 2011 from 2010 was due to lower interest rates during 2011 

during the first part of 2011 we had lower debt balances as a result of repayment and repurchases of debt made in 2010 with proceeds from asset sales and the november 2010 equity offering we reduced our outstanding debt at december 31 2010 to 65 billion in connection with the merger and pepr acquisition we added approximately 59 billion of debt at fair value at the beginning of june 2011 and approximately seven months of related interest expense in 2011 at december 31 2011 our debt balance was 114 billion a decrease from 121 billion at june 30 2011 primarily due to repayments funded by proceeds received from the dispositions of properties all of these activities have resulted in a lower weighted average effective interest rate including amortization of premiums discounts and deferred loan costs of 558 in 2011 as compared with 648 in 2010 

the increase in interest expense in 2010 over 2009 is due to increased borrowing rates and lower capitalization due to less development activity in 2010 in addition in 2010 we wroteoff 77 million in deferred loan costs based on the proportionate amount that we reduced our borrowing capacity on our global line of credit the lower amortization of discount is due to the buyback of exchangeable debt that includes a noncash discount our weighted average effective interest rate including amortization of deferred loan costs was 534 for the year ended december 31 2009 

our future interest expense both gross and the portion capitalized will vary depending on among other things the level of our development activities which we expect will increase subsequent to the merger see notes 3 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 and liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs 

earnings from unconsolidated investees net 

we recognized net earnings of 599 million 237 million and 281 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively these earnings relate to our investment in unconsolidated investees that are accounted for on the equity method the primary reason for the increase in 2011 over 2010 is due to the investments we acquired through the merger partially offset by the consolidation of pepr the earnings we recognize are impacted by i variances in revenues and expenses of the entity ii the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by the entity iii our ownership interest in the entity and iv fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to us dollars if applicable we manage the majority of the properties in which we have an ownership interest as part of our total owned and managed portfolio see discussion of our portfolio results in the section “portfolio information” see also note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized 

impairment of goodwill and other assets 

based on our review of goodwill in 2010 we recognized an impairment charge of 3685 million related to goodwill allocated to the real estate operations segment in the americas and europe reporting units the review of goodwill was triggered by the strategic decision we made in the fourth quarter of 2010 to significantly downsize our development platform and as a result to sell to third parties certain other assets some of which were acquired in the acquisitions that originally created the goodwill 

in 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded impairment charges of 1264 million 443 million and 1636 million respectively on certain of our investments in and advances to unconsolidated investees notes receivable and other assets as we did not believe these amounts to be recoverable based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows associated with these assets including estimated sales proceeds or we believed the decline in fair value to be other than temporary 

see notes 2 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information on our process with regard to analyzing the recoverability of goodwill and other assets also see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information on our unconsolidated investees 

  

interest and other income expense net 

we recognized interest and other income not allocated to a segment of 120 million and 158 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively and other expense of 393 million in 2009 the primary components in 2009 were adjustments of 203 million to accruals we had related to rent indemnifications we had made to certain coinvestment ventures due to changes in leasing and other assumptions and settlement costs of 130 million related to an obligation we assumed in the 2005 acquisition of catellus 

gains on acquisitions and dispositions of investments in real estate net 

during 2011 we recognized net gains on acquisitions and dispositions of investments in real estate in continuing operations of 1117 million this included gains recognized in the second quarter related to the pepr acquisition 859 million and the acquisition of our partner’s interest in a joint venture in japan 135 million and the contribution or sale of properties to unconsolidated coinvestment ventures the gains represent the adjustment to fair value of our equity investments at the time we gained control and consolidated the entities the contribution activity resulted in cash proceeds of 5908 million and net gains of 123 million 

during 2010 we recognized net gains on dispositions of investments in real estate in continuing operations of 285 million which related to the contribution of land and operating properties to unconsolidated investees 583 million gain additional proceeds from contributions we made to pepf ii in 2009 based on valuations received as of december 31 2010 and our contribution agreement with the fund 274 million gain and the sale of land parcels to third parties 74 million gain offset by a loss of 646 million related to the sale of certain unconsolidated investees 

the 2010 contribution activity resulted in cash proceeds of 4697 million related to the contribution of development properties aggregating 21 million square feet and land to unconsolidated investees and the sale of 90 of two development properties in japan with 13 million square feet we continue to own 10 of the japan properties which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and we continue to manage the properties 

during 2009 we recognized net gains of 353 million related to the contribution of properties 130 million the recognition of previously deferred gains from pepr and prologis korea fund on properties they sold to third parties 99 million the sale of land parcels 64 million and a gain on settlement of an obligation to our fund partner in connection with the restructure of one of our americas funds 60 million the contribution activity resulted in total cash proceeds of 6437 million and included 43 properties aggregating 92 million square feet to pepf ii 

if we realize a gain on contribution or sale of a property to an unconsolidated investee we recognize the portion attributable to the third party ownership in the entity if we realize a loss on contribution we recognize the full amount as soon as it is known due to our continuing involvement through our ownership in the coinvestment venture these dispositions are not included in discontinued operations 

foreign currency exchange and derivative gains losses net 

we and certain of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries may have intercompany or third party debt that is not denominated in the entity’s functional currency when the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity a gain or loss may result to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate certain of our intercompany debt is remeasured with the resulting adjustment recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in foreign currency translation gains losses net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss this treatment is applicable to intercompany debt that is deemed to be longterm in nature 

if the intercompany debt is deemed shortterm in nature when the debt is remeasured we recognize a gain or loss in earnings we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of 59 million and losses of 115 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively and gains of 582 million in 2009 related to the remeasurement of debt predominantly the gains or losses recognized in earnings relate to the remeasurement of intercompany loans between the us parent and certain consolidated subsidiaries in japan and europe and result from fluctuations in the exchange rates of us dollars to the euro japanese yen british pound sterling and singapore dollar in addition we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of 21 million and 04 million and losses of 226 million from the settlement of transactions with third parties during december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

in connection with the merger and the exchange offer discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 our convertible senior notes became exchangeable senior notes issued by the operating partnership that are exchangeable into common stock of the reit as a result the accounting for the exchangeable senior notes has changed and we are now required to separate the fair value of the derivative instrument exchange feature from the debt instrument and account for it separately as a derivative we adjust the derivative instrument at each reporting period to fair value with the resulting adjustment being recorded in earnings in 2011 we recognized an unrealized gain of 450 million 

gains losses on early extinguishment of debt net 

during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we purchased portions of several series of senior notes senior exchangeable notes and eurobonds outstanding and extinguished some secured mortgage debt prior to maturity which resulted in the recognition of gains of 03 million in 2011 losses of 2015 million in 2010 and gains of 1723 million in 2009 the gains or losses represent the difference between the recorded debt net of premiums and discounts and including related debt issuance costs and the consideration we paid to retire the debt including fees see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information regarding our debt repurchases 

  

income tax benefit expense 

during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 our current income tax expense was 216 million 217 million and 293 million respectively we recognize current income tax expense for income taxes incurred by our taxable reit subsidiaries and in certain foreign jurisdictions as well as certain state taxes we also include in current income tax expense the interest associated with our liability for uncertain tax positions our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income and changes in tax and interest rates 

in 2011 2010 and 2009 we recognized a net deferred tax benefit of 198 million 522 million and 233 million respectively deferred income tax expense is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in certain of our taxable subsidiaries operating in the us or in foreign jurisdictions the deferred tax benefit recorded during 2010 is primarily due to impairment charges recorded to the book basis of real estate properties and investments in unconsolidated investees net operating loss “nol” carryforwards recorded for certain jurisdictions and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to builtingains in addition during the second quarter of 2010 we recognized a deferred income tax benefit of approximately 275 million resulting from the conversion of two of our european management companies to taxable entities this conversion was approved by the applicable tax authorities in june 2010 and created an asset for tax purposes that will be utilized against future taxable income as it is amortized the deferred tax benefit was partially offset by an increase to the valuation allowance in certain jurisdictions because we could not sustain a conclusion that it was more likely than not that we could realize the deferred tax assets and nol carryforwards 

our income taxes are discussed in more detail in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

discontinued operations 

discontinued operations represent a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale if both the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction the results of operations of the component of the entity that has been classified as discontinued operations are reported separately in our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

during 2011 2010 and 2009 we disposed of land subject to ground leases and 94 205 and 140 properties respectively to third parties that met the requirements to be classified as discontinued operations therefore the results of operations for these disposed properties are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented along with the gains recognized during the period 

see notes 4 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

other comprehensive income loss – foreign currency translation losses net 

for our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar we translate their financial statements into us dollars at the time we consolidate those subsidiaries’ financial statements generally assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments due to the fluctuations in exchange rates from the beginning of the period to the end of the period are included in other comprehensive income loss  

during 2011 we recorded unrealized net losses in other comprehensive income loss of 1710 million that related to foreign currency translations of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars upon consolidation the euro and pound sterling remained relatively flat from december 31 2010 to december 31 2011 but both weakened to the us dollar from the merger and pepr acquisition date to december 31 2011 these losses were offset slightly by the strengthening of the yen to the us dollar during 2011 

during 2010 we recognized unrealized net losses in other comprehensive income loss of 423 million related to foreign currency translations of our international business units into us dollars upon consolidation mainly as a result of the yen strengthening against the us dollar partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar to the euro and pound sterling from the beginning of the year to december 31 2010 

during 2009 we recognized unrealized net gains in other comprehensive income loss of 599 million this includes 2092 million in gains mainly as a result of the strengthening of the british pound sterling to the us dollar offset partially by the strengthening of the us dollar to the euro and yen these gains were offset by a decrease in other comprehensive income of 1493 million as a result of the sale of our china operations and our investments in the japan property funds in february 2009 and represents the gains previously included as currency translation adjustments 

  

portfolio information 

our total owned and managed portfolio of properties includes operating industrial properties and does not include properties under development properties held for sale or nonindustrial properties and was as follows as of december 31 square feet in thousands 

 

 same store analysis 

we evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures we include properties owned by us and properties owned by the unconsolidated coinvestment ventures accounted for on the equity method that are managed by us referred to as “unconsolidated investees” in our same store analysis we have defined the same store portfolio for the three months ended december 31 2011 as those properties that were in operation at january 1 2010 and also december 31 2011 including completed development properties we have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party or were classified as held for sale from the population for both periods we believe the factors that impact rental income rental expenses and net operating income in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total portfolio in order to derive an appropriate measure of periodtoperiod operating performance we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the current exchange rate to translate from local currency into us dollars for both periods the same store portfolio included 5384 million of aggregated square feet 

the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental income rental expenses and net operating income calculated as rental income less rental expenses for the full year as included in our consolidated statements of operations in item 8 to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis 

 

   

 

  

  

   

  

 environmental matters 

a majority of the properties acquired by us were subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we record a liability for the estimated costs of environmental remediation to be incurred in connection with certain operating properties we acquire as well as certain land parcels we acquire in connection with the planned development of the land the liability is established to cover the environmental remediation costs including cleanup costs consulting fees for studies and investigations monitoring costs and legal costs relating to cleanup litigation defense and the pursuit of responsible third parties we purchase various environmental insurance policies to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

distribution and dividend requirements 

our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure we will meet the dividend requirements of the internal revenue code relative to maintaining our reit status while still allowing us to retain cash to meet other needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities 

prior to the merger prologis paid a cash distribution of 025 adjusted by merger exchange ratio per common share for the first quarter on february 28 2011 and for the second quarter on may 25 2011 also prior to the merger amb paid a dividend of 028 per common share on february 28 2011 for the first quarter and on may 25 2011 for the second quarter neither amb dividend has been reflected in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 since prologis is the accounting acquirer as discussed earlier we paid a cash dividend of 028 per common share for each of the third and fourth quarters of 2011 a cash distribution of 028 for the first quarter of 2012 was declared on february 22 2012 this distribution will be paid on march 30 2012 to holders of common shares on march 12 2012 our future common stock dividends may vary and will be determined by our board upon the circumstances prevailing at the time including our financial condition operating results and reit distribution requirements and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year 

at december 31 2011 we had seven series of preferred stock outstanding the annual dividend rates on preferred stock are 65 per series l share 675 per series m share 70 per series o share 685 per series p share 854 per series q share 675 per series r share and 675 per series s share the series q r and s were preferred shares of beneficial interest in prologis prior to the merger and distributions on those shares have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements in item 8 through december 31 2011 the dividends on the remaining preferred stock have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the merger the dividends on preferred stock are payable quarterly in arrears 

pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock has been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock 

critical accounting policies 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity’s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management generally the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance of the accounting policies discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies 

  

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

we assess the carrying values of our respective longlived assets including goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable 

recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change as well as other factors especially in the current global economic environment fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property quoted market values and third party appraisals where considered necessary the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property 

we use a two step approach to our goodwill impairment evaluation the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify whether there is any potential impairment if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its corresponding book value including goodwill the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the impairment test is performed the second step requires that we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss if any 

assumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties andor goodwill 

other than temporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated investees 

when circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary if we determine there is a loss in value that is other than temporary we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value the use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value the determination of when a loss is other than temporary and the calculation of the amount of the loss is complex and subjective use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions changes in economic and operating conditions as well as changes in our intent with regard to our investment that occur subsequent to our review could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our equity investments

we recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets generally at the time the title is transferred consideration is received and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold in many of our transactions an entity in which we have an ownership interest will acquire a real estate asset from us we make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the investee that acquires the assets we also make judgments regarding recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives based on when they are earned fixed and determinable 

business combinations 

we acquire individual properties as well as portfolios of properties or businesses when we acquire a business or individual operating properties with the intention to hold the investment for the longterm we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component the components typically include land building debt intangible assets related to above and below market leases value of costs to obtain tenants deferred tax liabilities and other assumed assets and liabilities in the case of an acquisition of a business in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often times is based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located the fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment which may differ when final information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period which typically does not exceed one year 

consolidation 

we consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100 but control as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity investments in entities in which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method investments in entities that we do not control and over which we do not exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as appropriate our ability to correctly assess our influence andor control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements 

  

capitalization of costs and depreciation 

we capitalize costs incurred in developing renovating rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred during the land development and construction periods we capitalize interest costs insurance real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets we also capitalize costs incurred to successfully originate a lease that result directly from and are essential to the acquisition of that lease leasing costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are presented as a component of other assets 

we estimate the depreciable portion of our real estate assets and related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense our ability to estimate the depreciable portions of our real estate assets and useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets any change to the assets to be depreciated and the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to estimate our income tax liability the liability associated with open tax years that are under review and our compliance with reit requirements our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws we estimate our actual current income tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities these estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain nonroutine transactions changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities our inability to qualify as a reit the potential for builtingain recognition changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to taxable reit subsidiaries and changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within income tax expense we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is “morelikelythannot” that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

funds from operations “ffo” 

ffo is a nongaap measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings although the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” has published a definition of ffo which was amended in late 2011 further modifications to the nareit calculation of ffo are common among reits as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business 

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor do we intend it to present a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance we believe net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap further we believe our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition and our operating performance 

nareit’s ffo measure adjusts net earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation gains and losses from the sales of and impairment charges of previously depreciated properties we agree that these nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

  

 we include the gains and losses from dispositions of land and development properties in ffo as a result if we recognize impairment charges related to these types of properties we also include the impairment charges in the calculation of ffo as defined by nareit we exclude from ffo as defined by nareit gains and losses from dispositions of properties other than land and development properties which we refer to as “nonffo properties” as well as any related impairment charges we include or exclude our share of these items recognized by our unconsolidated investees on the same basis 

  

our ffo measures 

at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community” we believe stockholders potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating results are best served by a defined ffo measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of ffo our ffo measures are used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe that it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses 

we use these ffo measures including by segment and region to i evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general and v evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a longterm outlook we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of items that we do not expect to affect the underlying longterm performance of the properties the longterm performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income while not infrequent or unusual these additional items we exclude in calculating our ffo measures are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative shortterm effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our longterm outlook 

we use our ffo measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance we do not use our ffo measures as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap as indicators of our operating performance as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs 

ffo as defined by prologis 

to arrive at ffo as defined by prologis  we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude 

 

  

  

  

  

 we calculate ffo as defined by prologis for our unconsolidated investees on the same basis as we calculate our ffo as defined by prologis 

we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy 

core ffo 

in addition to ffo as defined by prologis we also use core ffo  to arrive at core ffo we adjust ffo as defined by prologis  to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly or our share recognized by our unconsolidated investees to the extent they are included in ffo as defined by prologis  

 

       we believe it is appropriate to further adjust our ffo as defined by prologis for certain recurring items as they were driven by transactional activity and factors relating to the financial and real estate markets rather than factors specific to the ongoing operating performance of our properties or investments the impairment charges we recognized were primarily based on valuations of real estate which had declined due to market conditions that we no longer expected to hold for longterm investment we currently have and have had over the past several years a stated priority to strengthen our financial position we expect to accomplish this by reducing our debt our investment in certain low yielding assets such as land that we decide not to develop and our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations as a result we have sold to third parties or contributed to unconsolidated investees real estate properties that depending on market conditions might result in a gain or loss the impairment charges related to goodwill and other assets that we have recognized were similarly caused by the decline in the real 

  

estate markets also in connection with our stated priority to reduce debt and extend debt maturities we have purchased portions of our debt securities as a result we recognized net gains or losses on the early extinguishment of certain debt due to the financial market conditions at that time 

we have also adjusted for some nonrecurring items the merger acquisition and other integration expenses include costs we incurred in 2011 and that we expect to incur in 2012 associated with the merger and pepr acquisition and the integration of our systems and processes we have not adjusted for the acquisition costs that we have incurred as a result of routine acquisitions but only the costs associated with significant business combinations that we would expect to be infrequent in nature similarly the expenses related to the natural disaster in japan that we recognized in 2011 are a rare occurrence but we may incur similar expenses again in the future 

we analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental income of our real estate and the revenue driven by our private capital business net of operating administrative and financing expenses this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities as a result although these items have had a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the longterm 

we use core ffo  including by segment and region to i evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance v assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general and vi evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a longterm outlook we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of items that we do not expect to affect the underlying longterm performance of the properties we own as noted above we believe the longterm performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy 

limitations on use of our ffo measures 

while we believe our defined ffo measures are important supplemental measures neither nareit’s nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are therefore limited as an analytical tool accordingly they are only part of many measures we use when analyzing our business some of these limitations are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions to assist investors in compensating for these limitations we reconcile our defined ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap this information should be read with our complete financial statements prepared under gaap 

  

ffo as defined by prologis  attributable to common shares was 4117 million a negative 9742 million and 1855 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively core ffo attributable to common shares as defined by us was 5939 million 2374 million and 4167 million for the years ended 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in core ffo is primarily due to the merger and pepr acquisition both of which substantially increased our investments in real estate properties directly and through our unconsolidated investments as discussed earlier the reconciliations of core ffo and ffo as defined by prologis attributable to common shares to net earnings attributable to common shares computed under gaap are as follows for the periods indicated in thousands 

 

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreignexchange related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments we have used certain derivative financial instruments primarily foreign currency put option and forward contracts to reduce our foreign currency market risk as we deem appropriate we have also used interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate market risk we do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with established policies and procedures 

we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in year end interest rates the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to achieve this objective we primarily borrow on a fixed rate basis for longerterm debt issuances at december 31 2011 we have ¥611 billion 7884 million in tmk bond agreements and a ¥125 billion 1613 million term loan with variable interest rates we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate on ¥218 billion 2812 million as of december 31 2011 of the tmk bonds and the entire term loan for the term of the agreements at december 31 2011 we have also entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate on €7716 million 10 billion of secured debt of which €7436 million 9722 million relates to pepr with variable interest rates 

in 2011 we had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of 8709 million on our variable rate credit facilities based on the results of the sensitivity analysis which assumed a 10 adverse change in interest rates the estimated market risk exposure for the variable rate lines of credit was approximately 18 million of cash flow in 2011 

  

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates to the translation of the net income and financial position of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars principally euro british pound sterling and yen to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate we also may use foreign currency put option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the projected net operating income of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees at december 31 2011 we had no put option contracts outstanding and therefore we may experience fluctuations in our earnings as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we also have some exposure to movements in exchange rates related to certain intercompany loans we issue from time to time and we may use foreign currency forward contracts to manage these risks at december 31 2011 we had no forward contracts outstanding and therefore we may experience fluctuations in our earnings from the remeasurement of these intercompany loans due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates

investment strategy 

 

the company’s investment strategy focuses on providing distribution and logistics space to customers whose businesses are tied to global trade and depend on the efficient movement of goods through the global supply chain the company’s properties are primarily located in the world’s busiest distribution markets featuring large supplyconstrained infill locations with dense populations and proximity to airports seaports and ground transportation 

systems when measured by annualized base rent on an owned and managed basis a substantial majority of the company’s portfolio of industrial properties is located in its target markets and much of this is in infill submarkets infill locations are characterized by supply constraints on the availability of land for competing projects as well as physical political or economic barriers to new development the company believes that its facilities are essential to creating efficiencies in the supply chain and that its business encompasses a blend of real estate global logistics and infrastructure 

 

in its target markets the company focuses on htd ® facilities industrial properties designed to facilitate the rapid distribution of its customers’ products rather than the longterm storage of goods the company’s investment focus on htd ® assets is based on what it believes to be a global trend toward lower inventory levels and expedited supply chains htd ® facilities generally have a variety of physical and location characteristics that allow for the rapid transport of goods from point to point these physical characteristics could include numerous dock doors shallower building depths fewer columns large truck courts and more space for trailer parking the company believes that these building characteristics help its customers reduce their costs and become more efficient in their logistics operations the company’s customers include logistics freight forwarding and airexpress companies with timesensitive needs that value facilities proximate to transportation infrastructure 

 

the company believes that changes in global trade have been a primary driver of demand for industrial real estate for decades the company has observed that demand for industrial real estate is further influenced by the longterm relationship between trade and gdp trade and gdp are correlated as higher levels of investment production and consumption within a globalized economy are consistent with increased levels of imports and exports as the world produces and consumes more the company believes that the volume of global trade will continue to increase at a rate in excess of growth in global gdp in the second half of the year improving consumer demand and doubledigit gains in global production and trade led customers to begin rebuilding their inventory levels which is a trend that management believes will strengthen in 2011 management also believes that its key hub and gateway markets will continue to lead the recovery in operating fundamentals and that a stronger recovery of fundamentals is expected to take hold in 2011 with further increases in positive net absorption and declining availabilities 

 

primary sources of revenue and earnings 

 

the primary source of the company’s core earnings is revenue received from its real estate operations and private capital business the principal contributor of its core earnings is rent received from customers under longterm generally three to 10 years operating leases at its properties including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs and asset management fees the company also generates core earnings from its private capital business including priority distributions acquisition and development reimbursements promote interests and incentive distributions from its coinvestment ventures the company may generate additional earnings from the disposition of assets in its developmentforsale and valueadded conversion programs as well as from land sales 

 

longterm growth strategies 

 

the company believes that its longterm growth will be driven by its ability to 

 

 9 

 

growth through operations 

 

the company seeks to generate longterm internal growth by maintaining a high occupancy rate at its properties by controlling expenses and through contractual rent increases on existing space thus capitalizing on the economies of scale inherent in owning operating and growing a large global portfolio the company actively manages its portfolio by establishing leasing strategies and negotiating lease terms pricing and level and timing of property improvements with respect to its leasing strategies the company takes a longterm view to ensure it maximizes the value of its real estate as the company continues to work through a challenging operating environment and to provide flexibility to its customers the company evaluates and adjusts its leasing strategies for market terms and leasing rates which may include shorter leasing terms the company believes that its longstanding focus on customer relationships and ability to provide global solutions for a welldiversified customer base in the logistics shipping and air cargo industries will enable it to capitalize on opportunities as they arise 

 

the company believes the strategic infill locations within its portfolio the experience of its cycletested operations team and its ability to respond quickly to the needs of its customers provides a competitive advantage in leasing management believes the company’s regular maintenance capital expenditure energy management and sustainability programs create cost efficiencies that benefit the company and its customers 

 

growth through coinvestments 

 

the company through amb capital partners llc its private capital group was one of the pioneers of the real estate investment trust reit industry’s coinvestment model and has more than 27 years of experience in asset management and fund formation the company coinvests in properties with private capital investors through partnerships limited liability companies or other joint ventures the company has a direct and longstanding relationship with a significant number of institutional investors as of december 31 2010 more than 56 of the company’s owned and managed operating portfolio is held through its nine significant coinvestment ventures and funds the company tailors industrial portfolios to investors’ specific needs in separate or commingled accounts and deploys capital in both closeended and openended structures while providing complete portfolio management and financial reporting services generally the company is the largest investor in its openended funds and owns a 1050 interest in its coinvestment ventures the company believes its significant ownership in each of its funds provides a strong alignment of interests with its coinvestment partners’ interests 

 

the company believes its coinvestment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a source of capital for new investments and revenues for its stockholders in anticipation of the formation of future coinvestment ventures the company may also hold acquired and newly developed properties for contribution to future coinvestment ventures the company may make additional investments through its existing coinvestment ventures or to new coinvestment ventures in the future and currently plans to do so the company is in various stages of discussions with prospective investors to attract new capital to take advantage of potential future opportunities and these capitalraising activities may include the formation of new joint ventures such transactions if the company completes them may be material individually or in aggregate 

 

growth through acquisitions and capital redeployment 

 

the company believes its acquisition experience and its network of property management leasing and acquisition resources will continue to provide opportunities for growth in addition to its internal resources the company has longstanding relationships with lenders leasing and investment sales brokers as well as thirdparty local property management firms which may give it access to additional acquisition opportunities the company is actively monitoring opportunities in its target markets and intends to acquire highquality welllocated industrial real estate 

 

additionally the company seeks to acquire industrial properties that are wholly or partially vacant as a part of management’s belief that the discount in pricing attributed to the operating challenges of such a property could provide greater returns once it is stabilized valueadded acquisitions represent unstabilized properties acquired by the company which generally have one or more of the following characteristics i existing vacancy typically in excess of 20 ii shortterm lease rollover typically during the first two years of ownership or iii significant capital improvement requirements typically in excess of 20 of the purchase price the company excludes value 

added acquisitions from its owned and managed and consolidated operating statistics prior to stabilization generally 90 leased in order to provide investors with data which it feels better reflect the performance of its core portfolio the company strives to enhance the quality of its portfolio through acquisitions that are accretive to the company’s earnings and its net asset value the company also seeks to redeploy capital from the sale of nonstrategic assets into properties that better fit its current investment focus 

 

the company is generally engaged in various stages of negotiations for a number of acquisitions and other transactions some of which may be significant that may include but are not limited to individual properties large multiproperty portfolios and platforms and propertyowning or realestaterelated entities 

 

growth through development 

 

the company’s development business consists of conventional development buildtosuit development redevelopment valueadded conversions and land sales the company believes over the long term customer demand for new industrial space in strategic markets tied to global trade will continue to outpace supply most notably in major gateway markets in asia europe and the americas the company believes that developing redeveloping andor expanding of welllocated highquality industrial properties provides higher rates of return than may be obtained from purchasing existing properties however new developments redevelopments and valueadded conversions may require significant management attention and capital investment to maximize returns the company pursues development projects directly and in coinvestment ventures and development joint ventures providing it with the flexibility to pursue development projects independently or in partnerships depending on market conditions submarkets or building sites and availability of capital completed development and redevelopment properties are held in its owned and managed portfolio or sold to third parties 

 

management believes its longstanding focus on infill locations can at times lead to opportunities to enhance value through the conversion of some of the company’s industrial properties to higher and better uses valueadded conversion projects generally involve a significant enhancement or a change in use of the property from an industrial facility to a higher and better use including use as research  development manufacturing office residential or retail properties activities required to prepare the property for conversion to a higher and better use may include rezoning redesigning reconstructing and retenanting the sales price of a valueadded conversion project is generally based on the underlying land value reflecting its ultimate conversion to a higher and better use and as such little to no residual value is ascribed to the industrial building generally the company expects to sell to third parties these valueadded conversion projects at some point in the reentitlement and conversion process thus recognizing the enhanced value of the underlying land that supports the property’s repurposed use

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

business risks 

 

the company’s operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to it these risks include among others 

 

risks of the current economic environment 

 

disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 

global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions slower growth and recession in most major economies during the last two years although signs of recovery may exist there are continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation the availability and cost of credit a declining real estate market and geopolitical issues that contribute to increased market volatility and uncertain expectations for the global economy these conditions combined with declining business activity levels and consumer confidence increased unemployment and volatile oil prices contributed to unprecedented levels of volatility in the capital markets during the last two years any additional continued or recurring disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 

as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit have been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide funding to businesses and consumers these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending while the company currently believes that it has sufficient working capital and capacity under its credit facilities in the near term continued or recurring turbulence in the global markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect its liquidity and financial condition as well as the liquidity and financial condition of its customers if these market conditions persist recur or worsen in the long term they may limit the company’s ability and the ability of its customers to timely replace maturing liabilities and access the credit markets to meet liquidity needs 

 

if the longterm debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below its current levels the borrowing cost of debt under its unsecured credit facilities and certain term loans may increase in addition if the longterm debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below investment grade it may be unable to request borrowings in currencies other than us dollars or japanese yen as applicable however the lack of other currency borrowings does not affect its ability to fully draw down under the credit facilities or term loans while the operating partnership currently does not expect its longterm debt ratings to fall below investment grade in the event that its ratings do fall below those levels it may be unable to exercise its options to extend the term of its credit facilities and the loss of its ability to borrow in foreign currencies could affect its ability to optimally hedge its borrowings against foreign currency exchange rate changes in addition the company cannot assure you that additional continuing or recurring longterm disruptions in the global economy and the continuation of tighter credit conditions among and potential failures of thirdparty financial institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an adverse effect on the operating partnership’s borrowing capacity and liquidity position the operating partnership’s access to funds under its credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to the operating partnership the company cannot assure you that if one of the operating partnership’s lenders fails some of whom are lenders under a number of the operating partnership’s facilities the operating partnership will be successful in finding a replacement lender and as a result its borrowing capacity under the applicable facilities may be permanently reduced if the company does not have sufficient cash flows and income from its operations to meet its financial commitments and those lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to the operating partnership the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

certain of the company’s thirdparty indebtedness is held by the company’s consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures in the event that the company’s joint venture partner is unable to meet its obligations under the joint venture agreements or the thirdparty debt agreements the company may elect to pay its joint venture partner’s portion of debt to avoid foreclosure on the mortgaged property or permit the lender to foreclose on the mortgaged property to meet the joint venture’s debt obligations in either case the company could face a loss of income and asset value on the property 

 

there can be no assurance that the markets will stabilize in the near future or that the company will choose to or be able to increase its levels of capital deployment at such time or ever in addition a continued increase in the cost of credit and inability to access the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the occupancy of the company’s properties the disposition of its properties private capital raising and contribution of properties to its coinvestment ventures for example an inability to fully lease the company’s properties may result in such properties not meeting the company’s investment criteria for contributions to its coinvestment ventures if the company is unable to contribute completed development properties to its coinvestment ventures or sell its completed development projects to third parties the company will not be able to recognize gains from the contribution or sale of such properties and as a result the net income available to the parent company’s common stockholders and its funds from operations will decrease additionally business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect the company’s customers may adversely impact its business and financial condition furthermore general uncertainty in the real estate markets has resulted in conditions where the pricing of certain real estate assets may be difficult due to uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and valuations among other things which may add to the difficulty of buyers or the company’s coinvestment ventures to obtain financing on favorable terms to acquire such properties or cause potential buyers to not complete acquisitions of such properties the market uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and real estate valuations also adversely impacts the company’s net asset value in addition the operating partnership may face difficulty in refinancing its mortgage debt or may be unable to refinance such debt at all if its property values significantly decline such a decline may also cause a default under the loantovalue covenants in some of the company’s joint ventures’ mortgage debt which may require its joint ventures to remargin or pay down a portion of the applicable debt there can be no assurance however that in such an event the company will be able to do so to prevent foreclosure 

 

in the event that the company does not have sufficient cash available to it through its operations to continue operating its business as usual the company may need to find alternative ways to increase its liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation divesting itself of properties whether or not they otherwise meet the company’s strategic objectives to keep in the long term at less than optimal terms issuing and selling its debt and equity in public or private transactions under less than optimal conditions entering into leases with its customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with its existing customers without an increase in rental rates at turnover there can be no assurance however that such alternative ways to increase the company’s liquidity will be available to the company additionally taking such measures to increase the company’s liquidity may adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

 

as of december 31 2010 the company had 1984 million in cash and cash equivalents the company’s available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in its operating accounts the invested cash is invested in money market funds that invest solely in direct obligations of the government of the united states or in time deposits with certain financial institutions to date the company has experienced no loss or lack of access to its invested cash or cash equivalents however the company can provide no assurances that access to its invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

 

at any point in time the company also has a significant amount of cash deposits in its operating accounts that are with thirdparty financial institutions and as of december 31 2010 the amount in such deposits was approximately 1713 million on a consolidated basis these balances exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits while the company monitors daily the cash balances in its operating accounts and adjusts the cash balances as appropriate these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets to date the company has experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in its operating accounts 

the price per share of the parent company’s stock may decline or fluctuate significantly 

 

the market price per share of the parent company’s common stock may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including 

 

  

many of the factors listed above are beyond the company’s control these factors may cause the market price of shares of the parent company’s common stock to decline regardless of its financial condition results of operations business or its prospects 

 

risks related to our proposed merger transaction with prologis 

 

we will be subject to various uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending that could adversely affect our financial results 

 

uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on us these uncertainties may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter and could cause customers suppliers and others who deal with us to 

seek to change existing business relationships employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to completion of the merger as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company 

 

the pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration may place a significant burden on management and internal resources any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect our financial results 

 

in addition the merger agreement restricts us without prologis’ consent from making certain acquisitions and dispositions from engaging in certain capital raising transactions and taking other specified actions while the merger is pending these restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement 

 

pending litigation against amb and prologis could result in an injunction preventing completion of the merger and the payment of damages in the event the merger is completed andor may adversely affect our company’s business financial condition or results of operation before the merger andor the combined company’s business financial condition or results of operations following the merger 

 

in connection with the merger purported stockholders of prologis have filed two putative stockholder class action lawsuits against us and prologis among others among other remedies the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the merger we may be subject to additional stockholder class action lawsuits during the pendency of the merger if a final settlement is not reached these lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the merger and result in substantial costs to us including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations andor the combined company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

 

we may be unable to obtain in the anticipated timeframe or at all satisfaction of all conditions to complete the merger or in order to do so we may be required to comply with material restrictions or conditions that may negatively affect the combined company after the merger is completed or cause us to abandon the merger failure to complete the merger could negatively affect our future business and financial results 

 

completion of the merger is contingent upon among other things receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the absence of any injunction prohibiting the merger all required regulatory authorizations approvals or consents may not be obtained or may contain terms conditions or restrictions that will be detrimental to the combined company after completion of the merger 

 

the stockholders of both amb and prologis must approve the merger transaction at special stockholder meetings to be held after our merger proxy and registration statement is effective if the stockholders of either company do not approve the merger the merger will not be consummated 

 

in addition satisfying the conditions to and completion of the merger may take longer than and could cost more than we expect any delay in completing or any additional conditions imposed in order to complete the merger may materially adversely affect the synergies and other benefits that we and prologis expect to achieve from the merger and the integration of our businesses 

 

we may be unable to satisfy all the conditions to the merger or succeed in any litigation brought in connection with the merger if the merger is not completed our financial results may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks including but not limited to 

 

 17 

 

any delay or inability to satisfy all conditions to complete the merger or failure to complete the merger could negatively affect our future business financial condition or results of operation 

 

if completed the merger may not achieve its intended results and we and prologis may be unable to successfully integrate our operations 

 

we and prologis entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in various benefits including among other things cost savings and operating efficiencies achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties including whether the businesses of amb and prologis can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner 

 

if the merger is completed it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures practices policies and compensation arrangements any of which could adversely affect the combined company’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger the combined company’s results of operations could also be adversely affected by any issues attributable to either company’s operations that arise or are based on events or actions that occur prior to the closing of the merger the companies may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits will be realized or if realized the timing of their realization failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect the combined company’s future business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

 

debt financing risks 

 

the company faces risks associated with the use of debt to fund its business activities including refinancing and interest rate risks 

 

as of december 31 2010 the operating partnership had total debt outstanding of 33 billion as of december 31 2010 the parent company guaranteed 17 billion of the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in the parent company’s financial statements the operating partnership is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest it is likely that the operating partnership will need to refinance at least a portion of its outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that the operating partnership may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of its existing debt if the operating partnership is unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions then the operating partnership expects that its cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all such maturing debt and to pay distributions to its unitholders including the parent company which in turn will be unable to pay cash dividends to its stockholders furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase higher interest rates on newly incurred debt may negatively impact the operating partnership as well if interest rates increase the operating partnership’s interest costs and overall costs of capital will increase which could adversely affect its financial condition results of operation and cash flow the market price of the parent company’s stock the operating partnership’s ability to pay principal and interest on its debt and to pay distributions to its unitholders the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the operating partnership’s capital deployment activity in addition there may be circumstances that will require the operating partnership to obtain amendments or waivers to provisions in its credit facilities or other financings there can be no assurance that the operating partnership will be able to obtain necessary amendments or waivers at all or without significant expense in such case the operating partnership may not be able to fund its business activities as planned within budget or at all 

 

in addition if the company mortgages one or more of its properties to secure payment of indebtedness and the company is unable to meet mortgage payments then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the lender with a consequent loss of income and asset value a foreclosure on one or more of the company’s properties could adversely affect its financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay distributions to the 

operating partnership’s unitholders and cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock 

 

as of december 31 2010 the company had outstanding bank guarantees in the amount of 03 million used to secure contingent obligations primarily obligations under development and purchase agreements as of december 31 2010 the company also guaranteed 586 million and 835 million on outstanding loans for five of its consolidated coinvestment ventures and three of its unconsolidated coinvestment ventures respectively also the company has entered into contribution agreements with certain of its unconsolidated coinvestment venture funds these contribution agreements require the company to make additional capital contributions to the applicable coinvestment venture fund upon certain defaults by the coinvestment venture of its debt obligations to the lenders such additional capital contributions will cover all or part of the applicable coinvestment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater than the company’s share of the coinvestment venture’s debt obligation or the value of the company’s share of any property securing such debt the company’s contribution obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the property if any used to secure the debt and obtained by the lender upon default the company’s potential obligations under these contribution agreements were 2606 million as of december 31 2010 the company intends to continue to guarantee debt of its unconsolidated coinvestment venture funds and make additional contributions to its unconsolidated coinvestment venture funds in connection with property contributions to the funds such payment obligations under such guarantees and contribution obligations under such contribution agreements if required to be paid could be of a magnitude that could adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock 

 

adverse changes in the company’s credit ratings could negatively affect its financing activity 

 

the credit ratings of the operating partnership’s senior unsecured longterm debt and the parent company’s preferred stock are based on its operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of the company the company’s credit ratings can affect the amount of capital it can access as well as the terms and pricing of any debt the operating partnership may incur in addition the announcement of the proposed merger transaction with prologis resulted in the company being placed on a negative credit rating watch list and because prologis’ credit rating is lower than the company’s the credit rating of the combined company may be adversely affected if the proposed merger is completed there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its current credit ratings and in the event its current credit ratings are downgraded the company would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing also a downgrade in the company’s credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under its current and future credit facilities and debt instruments for example if the operating partnership’s credit ratings of its senior unsecured longterm debt are downgraded to below investment grade levels the operating partnership may not be able to obtain or maintain extensions on certain of its existing debt adverse changes in the operating partnership’s credit ratings could negatively impact its refinancing and other capital market activities its ability to manage its debt maturities its future growth its financial condition the market price of the parent company’s stock and its development and acquisition activity 

 

covenants in the operating partnership’s debt agreements could adversely affect its financial condition 

 

the terms of the operating partnership’s credit agreements and other indebtedness require that it complies with a number of financial and other covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit flexibility in the operating partnership’s operations and its failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement even if it has satisfied its payment obligations as of december 31 2010 the operating partnership had certain nonrecourse secured loans which are crosscollateralized by multiple properties if the operating partnership defaults on any of these loans it may then be required to repay such indebtedness together with applicable prepayment charges to avoid foreclosure on all the crosscollateralized properties within the applicable pool foreclosure on the operating partnership’s properties or its inability to refinance its loans on favorable terms could adversely impact its financial 

condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders or distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock in addition the operating partnership’s credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain crossdefault provisions which are triggered in the event that its other material indebtedness is in default these crossdefault provisions may require the operating partnership to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default which could adversely affect the operating partnership’s financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay distributions to its unitholders and the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the market price of its stock 

 

failure to hedge effectively against exchange and interest rates may adversely affect results of operations 

 

the company seeks to manage its exposure to exchange and interest rate volatility by using exchange and interest rate hedging arrangements such as cap agreements and swap agreements these agreements involve risks such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing the company’s exposure to exchange or interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable hedging may reduce overall returns on the company’s investments failure to hedge effectively against exchange and interest rate changes may materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

 

the company is dependent on external sources of capital 

 

in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust the parent company is required each year to distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of its real estate investment trust taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain and is subject to tax to the extent its income is not fully distributed while historically the parent company has satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to its stockholders the parent company may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december 31 2011 and in some cases declared as late as december 31 2012 the parent company can satisfy up to 90 of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of its stock if certain conditions are met assuming the parent company continues to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash the parent company and the operating partnership may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital further in order to maintain the parent company’s real estate investment trust status and avoid the payment of federal income and excise taxes the parent company through the operating partnership may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the real estate investment trust distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments the company’s ability to access private debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of the company’s growth potential its current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of its securities 

 

the operating partnership could incur more debt increasing its debt service 

 

as of december 31 2010 the operating partnership’s share of total debttoits share of total market capitalization ratio was 413 the operating partnership’s definition of “the operating partnership’s share of total market capitalization” is the operating partnership’s share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity see footnote 1 to the capitalization ratios table contained in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation — liquidity and capital resources” for the operating partnership’s definitions of “market equity” and “the operating partnership’s share of total debt” as this ratio percentage increases directly with a decrease in the market price per share of the parent company’s capital stock an unstable market environment will impact this ratio in a volatile manner there can also 

be no assurance that the operating partnership would not become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to its unitholders and in turn the cash available to distribute to the parent company’s stockholders furthermore if the operating partnership becomes more highly leveraged the operating partnership may not be in compliance with the debt covenants contained in the agreements governing its coinvestment ventures which could adversely impact its private capital business 

 

other real estate industry risks 

 

the company’s performance and value are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with its real estate assets 

 

the investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the properties as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties if the company’s properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures then the operating partnership’s ability to pay distributions to its unitholders including the parent company and in turn the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders could be adversely affected in addition there are significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate such as mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs that generally do not decline when circumstances reduce the income from the property income from and the value of the company’s properties may be adversely affected by 

 

  

in addition periods of economic slowdown or recession in the united states and in other countries rising interest rates diminished access to or availability of capital or declining demand for real estate may result in a general decrease in rents an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases or greater difficulty in financing the company’s acquisition and development activities which would adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations future terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity which could reduce the demand for and the value of the company’s properties to the extent that future attacks impact the company’s customers their businesses similarly could be adversely affected including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases 

 

the company’s properties are concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector as a result of this concentration the company feels the impact of an economic downturn in this sector more acutely than if the company’s portfolio included other property types 

 

the company may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or relet space as leases expire 

 

as of december 31 2010 on an owned and managed basis the company’s occupancy average was 912 yeartodate and the leases on 164 of the company’s industrial properties based on annualized base rent will expire on or prior to december 31 2011 the company derives most of its income from rent received from its customers accordingly the company’s financial condition results of operations cash flow and its ability to pay 

dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock could be adversely affected if the company is unable to lease vacant space at favorable rents or terms or at all and to promptly relet or renew expiring leases or if the rental rates upon leasing renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected there can be no assurance that the company will be able to lease its vacant space renew its expiring leases increase its occupancy to its historical averages or generally realize the potential of its currently lowyielding assets including the buildout and leasing of its development platform periods of economic slowdown or recession are likely to adversely affect the company’s leasing activities if a customer experiences a downturn in its business or other type of financial distress then it may be unable to make timely rental payments or renew its lease further the company’s ability to rent space and the rents that it can charge are impacted not only by customer demand but by the number of other properties the company has to compete with to appeal to customers 

 

the company could be adversely affected if a significant number of its customers are unable to meet their lease obligations 

 

the company’s results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of the parent company’s stock would be adversely affected if a significant number of the company’s customers were unable to meet their lease obligations in the current economic environment it is likely that customer bankruptcies will increase if a customer seeks the protection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws such customer’s lease may be terminated in the process and result in a reduction of cash flow to the company in the event of a significant number of lease defaults andor tenant bankruptcies the company’s cash flow may not be sufficient to pay distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders and cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and repay maturing debt and any other obligations as of december 31 2010 on an owned and managed basis the company did not have any single customer account for annualized base rent revenues greater than 31 however in the event of lease defaults by a significant number of the company’s customers the company may incur substantial costs in enforcing its rights as landlord 

 

declining real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely affect the company’s earnings and financial condition 

 

the economic downturn has generally resulted in lower real estate valuations which has required the company to recognize real estate impairment charges on its assets the company conducts a comprehensive review of all real estate asset classes in accordance with its policy of accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets which indicates that asset values should be analyzed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable the intended use of an asset either held for sale or held for the long term can significantly impact how impairment is measured if an asset is intended to be held for the long term the impairment analysis is based on a twostep test the first test measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding period including a residual value undiscounted and without interest charges against the carrying value of the property if the asset fails the first test then the asset carrying value is measured against the estimated fair value from a market participant standpoint with the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the estimated fair value recognized as an impairment charge to earnings if an asset is intended to be sold impairment is tested based on a onestep test comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value less costs to sell the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital the company determines the estimated fair values based on assumptions regarding rental rates costs to complete leaseup and holding periods as well as sales prices or contribution values the company also utilizes the knowledge of its regional teams and the recent valuations of its two openended funds which contain a large geographically diversified pool of assets all of which are subject to thirdparty appraisals on at least an annual basis as a result of changing market conditions the company may need to reevaluate the carrying value of its investments and recognize real estate impairment losses on certain of its investments 

 

the principal trigger which has led to impairment charges in the recent past was the severe economic deterioration in some markets resulting in a decrease in leasing and rental rates rising vacancies and an increase in capitalization rates impairments may be necessary in the future in the event that market conditions deteriorate and 

impact the factors used to estimate fair value which may include impairments relating to the company’s unconsolidated real estate as well as impairments relating to the company’s investments in its unconsolidated coinvestment ventures investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are presented under the equity method the equity method is used when the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the joint venture but does not have control of the joint venture under the equity method these investments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the company’s proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the joint venture distributions received contributions deferred gains from the contribution of properties and certain other adjustments as appropriate when circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity investment the company evaluates the investment for impairment by estimating the company’s ability to recover its investment or if the loss in value is other than temporary to evaluate whether an impairment is other than temporary the company considers relevant factors including but not limited to the period of time in any unrealized loss position the likelihood of a future recovery and the company’s positive intent and ability to hold the investment until the forecasted recovery if the company determines the loss in value is other than temporary the company recognizes an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including but not limited to discounted cash flow models quoted market values and third party appraisals during the year ended december 31 2010 the company did not record any impairment on its investments in unconsolidated coinvestment ventures there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions the company uses to assess impairments are accurate and will reflect actual results a worsening real estate market may cause the company to reevaluate the assumptions used in its impairment analysis and its intent to hold sell develop or contribute properties impairment charges could adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations and its ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock

federal income tax risks 

 

the parent company’s failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have serious adverse consequences to its stockholders 

 

the parent company elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “internal revenue code” commencing with its taxable year ended december 31 1997 the parent company believes it has operated so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code and believes that the parent company’s current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable it to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust however it is possible that the parent company has been organized or has operated in a manner that would not allow it to qualify as a real estate investment trust or that the parent company’s future operations could cause it to fail to qualify qualification as a real estate investment trust requires the parent company to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex sections of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the parent company’s control for example in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust the parent company must derive at least 95 of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition the parent company must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of 

its real estate investment trust taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis while historically the parent company has satisfied the distribution requirement discussed above by making cash distributions to its stockholders the parent company may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december 31 2011 and in some cases declared as late as december 31 2012 the parent company can satisfy up to 90 of this distribution requirement through the distribution of shares of its stock if certain conditions are met the provisions of the internal revenue code and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a real estate investment trust are more complicated in the parent company’s case because it holds its assets through the operating partnership 

 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year the parent company will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates unless the parent company is entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions the parent company would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which the parent company lost its qualification if the parent company lost its real estate investment trust status the parent company’s net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved in addition the parent company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders 

 

furthermore the parent company owns a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit the parent company’s interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and any dividend income or gains derived by the parent company from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit gross income tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to united states federal income tax in addition a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect on the parent company’s ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus the parent company’s ability to qualify as a reit 

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction 

 

from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties including by contributing properties to its coinvestment venture funds under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax the company does not believe that its transfers or disposals of property or its contributions of properties into its coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by the company or contributions of properties into the company’s coinvestment venture funds are prohibited transactions while the company believes that the internal revenue service would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to the company from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect the company’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust 

 

the parent company may in the future choose to pay dividends in its own stock in which case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive 

 

the parent company may distribute taxable dividends that are partially payable in cash and partially payable in its stock up to 90 of any such taxable dividend with respect to calendar years 2008 through 2011 and in some 

cases declared as late as december 31 2012 could be payable in the parent company’s stock if certain conditions are met taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of the parent company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits for united states federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of the parent company’s stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders the parent company may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition if a significant number of the parent company’s stockholders determine to sell shares of its stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends it may put downward pressure on the trading price of the parent company’s stock 

 

legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect the parent company’s stockholders 

 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax laws applicable to investments in reits and similar entities additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future and there can be no assurance that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of the parent company the operating partnership any stockholder of the parent company or any limited partner of the operating partnership 

 

conflicts of interest risks 

 

some of the company’s directors and executive officers are involved in other real estate activities and investments and therefore may have conflicts of interest with the company 

 

from time to time certain of the company’s executive officers and directors may own interests in other realestate related businesses and investments including de minimis holdings of the equity securities of public and private real estate companies the company’s executive officers’ involvement in other real estaterelated activities could divert their attention from the company’s daytoday operations the company’s executive officers have entered into noncompetition agreements with the company pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities directly or indirectly in respect of commercial real estate and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate other than through ownership of not more than 5 of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through certain specified investments state law may limit the company’s ability to enforce these agreements the company will not acquire any properties from its executive officers directors or their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and independent as defined by the rules of the new york stock exchange members of the parent company’s board of directors with respect to that transaction 

 

the parent company’s role as general partner of the operating partnership may conflict with the interests of its stockholders 

 

as the general partner of the operating partnership the parent company has fiduciary obligations to the operating partnership’s limited partners the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of the parent company’s stockholders in addition those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the operating partnership’s partnership agreement and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights the limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of the parent company’s stockholders in addition under the terms of the operating partnership’s partnership agreement holders of limited partnership units will have approval rights with respect to specified transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders 

risks associated with government regulations 

 

the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and any related potential liability could exceed the company’s budgets for these items 

 

under various environmental laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at on under in or from its property the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial these laws typically impose liability and cleanup responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination 

 

environmental laws in some countries including the united states also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of the company’s properties are known to contain asbestoscontaining building materials 

 

in addition some of the company’s properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances further certain of the company’s properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time the company may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions where the company believes that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in such an instance the company underwrites the costs of environmental investigation cleanup and monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtains appropriate environmental insurance for the property further in connection with certain divested properties the company has agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties 

 

at the time of acquisition the company subjects all of its properties to a phase i or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants and the company may have additional phase ii testing performed upon the consultant’s recommendation these environmental assessments have not revealed and the company is not aware of any environmental liability that it believes would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole nonetheless it is possible that the assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities unknown to the company or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are greater than the company anticipated further the company’s properties’ current environmental condition may be affected by customers the condition of land operations in the vicinity of the properties such as releases from underground storage tanks or by unrelated third parties if the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed the company’s budgets for these items then the company’s financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock could be adversely affected 

 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs 

 

under the americans with disabilities act places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants if the company is required to make 

unanticipated expenditures to comply with the americans with disabilities act including removing access barriers then the company’s cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders may be adversely affected the company’s properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and lifesafety requirements the company could incur fines or private damage awards if it fails to comply with these requirements while the company believes that its properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by the company that will affect its cash flow and results of operations 

 

risks associated with ownership of the parent company’s stock 

 

limitations in the parent company’s charter and bylaws could prevent a change in control 

 

certain provisions of the parent company’s charter and bylaws may delay defer or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of the parent company’s common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for the common stock to maintain the parent company’s qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of the parent company’s outstanding stock may be owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made furthermore the parent company’s common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12month taxable year or a proportionate part of a short tax year in addition if the parent company or an owner of 10 or more of the parent company’s stock actually or constructively owns 10 or more of one of the parent company’s customers or a customer of any partnership in which the company is a partner then the rent received by the parent company either directly or through any such partnership from that customer will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the internal revenue code to help the parent company maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes the parent company prohibits the ownership actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the internal revenue code by any single person of more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the issued and outstanding shares of each of the parent company’s common stock series l preferred stock series m preferred stock series o preferred stock and series p preferred stock unless such limitations are waived by the parent company’s board of directors the parent company refers to this limitation as the “ownership limit” the charter provides that shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary the charter further provides that any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale a transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances the ownership limit may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control and therefore could adversely affect the parent company’s stockholders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for the shares of the parent company’s common stock in connection with such transaction 

 

the parent company’s charter authorizes it to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that the parent company issues the parent company’s board of directors could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction including a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the parent company’s stockholders 

 

the parent company’s charter and bylaws and maryland law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without the approval of the parent company’s board of directors which in turn may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control the parent company’s charter and bylaws include the following provisions 

 

 34 

  

  

maryland law includes the following provisions 

 

  

in addition the parent company’s board could elect to adopt without stockholder approval other provisions under maryland law that may impede a change in control 

 

if the parent company issues additional securities then the investment of existing stockholders will be diluted 

 

as the parent company is a real estate investment trust the company is dependent on external sources of capital and the parent company may issue common or preferred stock and the operating partnership may issue debt securities to fund the company’s future capital needs the company has the authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities and to cause the operating partnership or amb property ii lp one of the company’s subsidiaries to issue limited partnership units in exchange for property or otherwise existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by the operating partnership amb property ii lp or the parent company and any issuance of additional equity securities may adversely affect the market price of the parent company’s stock and could result in dilution of an existing stockholder’s investment in addition in the event the proposed merger with prologis is completed the investment of existing stockholders will be diluted based on the exchange ratio of prologis shares of common stock into the company’s shares which will result in current amb stockholders owning approximately 40 of the combined company 

 

earnings cash dividends asset value and market interest rates affect the price of the parent company’s stock 

 

as the parent company is a real estate investment trust the market value of the parent company’s equity securities in general is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the parent company’s growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash dividends the market value of the parent company’s equity securities is based secondarily upon the market value of its underlying real estate assets for this reason shares of the parent company’s stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than its net asset value per share to the extent that the parent company retains operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of the parent company’s underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of its stock the parent company’s failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of the parent company’s stock further the distribution yield on the stock as a percentage of the price of the stock relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of the parent company’s stock an increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of the parent company’s stock to expect a higher distribution yield which would adversely affect the parent company’s stock’s market price additionally if the market price of the parent company’s stock declines significantly then the operating partnership might breach certain covenants with respect to its debt obligations which could adversely affect the company’s liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the operating partnership’s ability to pay distributions to its unitholders 

 

the parent company’s board of directors has decided to align the parent company’s regular dividend payments with the projected taxable income from recurring operations alone the parent company may make special 

distributions going forward as necessary related to taxable income associated with any asset dispositions and gain activity in the past the parent company’s board of directors has suspended dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and it is possible that they may do so again in the future or decide to pay dividends partially in the parent company’s own stock as provided for in the internal revenue code 

 

the parent company could change its investment and financing policies without a vote of stockholders 

 

subject to the parent company’s current investment policy to maintain the parent company’s qualification as a real estate investment trust unless a change is approved by the parent company’s board of directors under certain circumstances the parent company’s board of directors determines the company’s investment and financing policies its growth strategy and its debt capitalization distribution and operating policies the parent company’s board of directors may revise or amend these strategies and policies at any time without a vote of stockholders any such changes may not serve the interests of all of the parent company’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s unitholders and could adversely affect the company’s financial condition or results of operations including its ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders 

 

shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of the parent company’s common stock 

 

the operating partnership and amb property ii lp had 3041743 common limited partnership units issued and outstanding as of december 31 2010 all of which are currently exchangeable on a oneforone basis into shares of the parent company’s common stock in the future the operating partnership or amb property ii lp may issue additional limited partnership units and the parent company may issue shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of properties or in private placements these shares of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets over time pursuant to registration rights that the parent company has granted or may grant in connection with future issuances or pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act of 1933 in addition common stock issued under the company’s stock option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that the parent company has filed or pursuant to rule 144 as of december 31 2010 under the company’s stock option and incentive plans the company had 4014453 shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance had outstanding options to purchase 8694938 shares of common stock of which 6361551 are vested and exercisable and 5731803 have exercise prices below market value at december 31 2010 and had 1202122 unvested restricted shares of common stock outstanding future sales of a substantial number of shares of the parent company’s common stock in the market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of the parent company’s common stock further the existence of the common limited partnership units of the operating partnership and amb property ii lp and the shares of the parent company’s common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the exercise of options and registration rights referred to above may adversely affect the terms upon which the parent company is able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities 

 

risks associated with the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

 

the company’s business could be adversely impacted if it has deficiencies in its disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 

 

the design and effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management will continue to review the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that the company’s internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time furthermore the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting with respect to entities that the company does not control or manage or thirdparty entities that the company may acquire may be substantially more limited than those the company maintains with respect to the subsidiaries that the company has controlled or managed over the course of 

time deficiencies including any material weakness in the company’s internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of the company’s results of operations restatements of its financial statements a decline in the parent company’s stock price or otherwise materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations financial condition or liquidity

overview of our global market presence the company’s industrial properties are located in the following markets 

 

 

 

within these metropolitan areas the company’s industrial properties are generally concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established relatively large submarkets which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere these infill locations are typically near major airports or seaports or convenient to major highway systems and rail lines and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools there is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrallylocated submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses including warehouse distribution light assembly and manufacturing the company generally avoids locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties

critical accounting policies 

 

the company’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods the company evaluates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis the company bases its estimates on historical experience and 

on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

 

investments in real estate investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered in which case an adjustment to the carrying value of the property is made to reduce it to its estimated fair value the company also regularly reviews the impact of above or belowmarket leases inplace leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions and records an intangible asset or liability accordingly 

 

the company conducts a comprehensive review of all real estate asset classes in accordance with its policy of accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets which indicates that asset values should be analyzed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable the intended use of an asset either held for sale or held for the long term can significantly impact how impairment is measured if an asset is intended to be held for the long term the impairment analysis is based on a twostep test the first test measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding period including a residual value undiscounted and without interest charges against the carrying value of the property if the asset fails the test then the asset carrying value is measured against the estimated fair value from a market participant standpoint with the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the estimated fair value recognized as an impairment charge to earnings if an asset is intended to be sold impairment is tested based on a onestep test comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value less costs to sell the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital the company determines the estimated fair values based on assumptions regarding rental rates costs to complete leaseup and holding periods as well as sales prices or contribution values the company also utilizes the knowledge of its regional teams and the recent valuations of its two openended funds which contain a large geographically diversified pool of assets all of which are subject to thirdparty appraisals on at least an annual basis 

 

revenue recognition the company records rental revenue from operating leases on a straightline basis over the term of the leases and maintains an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of the company’s customers to make required payments if customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts security deposits and letters of credit then the company may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods the company monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its customers on an ongoing basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate each period the company reviews its outstanding accounts receivable including straightline rents for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed the company also records lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with the company and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to the company if a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s occupancy 

 

property dispositions the company reports real estate dispositions in four separate categories on its consolidated statements of operations first when the company divests a portion of its interests in real estate entities or properties gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by thirdparty investors for cash and are included in gains from sale or contribution of real estate interests in the statements of operations second the company disposes of valueadded conversion projects and buildtosuit and speculative development projects for which it has not generated material operating income prior to sale the gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes when applicable and is included in development profits net of taxes within continuing operations of the statements of operations third the company disposes of valueadded conversion and other redevelopment projects for which it may have generated material operating income prior to sale the gain or loss recognized is reported net of estimated taxes when applicable in the development profits net of taxes line within discontinued operations lastly guidance related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets requires the company to separately report as discontinued operations the historical 

operating results attributable to industrial operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties which is included in development profits and gains from sale of real estate interests net of taxes in the statements of operations the consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also retrospectively adjusted to conform with guidance regarding accounting for discontinued operations and noncontrolling interests and there is no impact on the company’s previously reported consolidated financial position net income or cash flows in all cases gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met 

 

joint ventures the company holds interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures the company consolidates joint ventures where it exhibits financial or operational control control is determined using accounting standards related to the consolidation of joint ventures and variable interest entities in june 2009 the fasb issued amended guidance related to the consolidation of variableinterest entities these amendments require an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity “vie” based on whether the entity 1 has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the vie and 2 has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie additionally they require an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary and provide a framework for the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a vie this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 and the company has adopted this guidance as of january 1 2010 the company has evaluated the impact of the adoption of this guidance and it did not have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

for joint ventures that are defined as variable interest entities the primary beneficiary consolidates the entity in instances where the company is not the primary beneficiary it does not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes for joint ventures that are not defined as variable interest entities management first considers whether the company is the general partner or a limited partner or the equivalent in such investments which are not structured as partnerships the company consolidates joint ventures where it is the general partner or the equivalent and the limited partners or the equivalent in such investments do not have rights which would preclude control and therefore consolidation for financial reporting purposes for joint ventures where the company is the general partner or the equivalent but does not control the joint venture as the other partners or the equivalent hold substantive participating rights the company uses the equity method of accounting for joint ventures where the company is a limited partner or the equivalent management considers factors such as ownership interest voting control authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners or the equivalent to determine if the presumption that the general partner controls the entity is overcome in instances where these factors indicate the company controls the joint venture the company consolidates the joint venture otherwise it uses the equity method of accounting 

 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are presented under the equity method under the equity method these investments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the company’s proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the joint venture distributions received contributions deferred gains from the contribution of properties and certain other adjustments as appropriate when circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity investment the company evaluates the investment for impairment by estimating the company’s ability to recover its investment or if the loss in value is other than temporary to evaluate whether an impairment is other than temporary the company considers relevant factors including but not limited to the period of time in any unrealized loss position the likelihood of a future recovery and the company’s positive intent and ability to hold the investment until the forecasted recovery if the company determines the loss in value is other than temporary the company recognizes an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including but not limited to discounted cash flow models quoted market values and third party appraisals

in order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles the parent company presently intends over the long term to operate with a parent company’s share of total debttoparent company’s share of total market capitalization ratio or parent company’s share of total debttoparent company’s share of total assets of approximately 45 or less in order to operate at this targeted ratio over the long term the parent company is currently exploring various options to monetize its development assets through possible contribution to funds where capacity is available the formation of joint ventures and the sale to third parties it is also exploring the potential sale of industrial operating assets to further enhance liquidity as of december 31 2010 the parent company’s share of total debttoparent company’s share of total assets ratio was 430 see footnote 1 to the capitalization ratios table below for the definitions of “parent company’s share of total market capitalization” “market equity” “parent company’s share of total debt” and “parent company’s share of total assets” the parent company typically finances its coinvestment ventures with secured debt at a loantovalue ratio of 5065 pursuant to its coinvestment venture agreements additionally the operating partnership currently intends to manage its capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on its senior unsecured debt regardless of these policies however the parent company’s and operating partnership’s 

organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that either entity may incur accordingly management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder or unitholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render the parent company or the operating partnership unable to comply with these policies for example decreases in the market price of the parent company’s common stock have caused an increase in the ratio of parent company’s share of total debttoparent company’s share of total market capitalization 

 

 

 

 

  

liquidity of the parent company 

 

the liquidity of the parent company is dependent on the operating partnership’s ability to make sufficient distributions to the parent company the primary cash requirement of the parent company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders the parent company also guarantees some of the operating partnership’s secured and unsecured debt described in the “debt guarantees” section below if the operating partnership fails to fulfill its debt requirements which trigger parent guarantee obligations then the parent company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees 

 

the parent company believes the operating partnership’s sources of working capital specifically its cash flow from operations and borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the parent company and in turn for the parent company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders however there can be no assurance that the operating partnership’s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs including its ability to make distribution payments to the parent company the unavailability of capital could adversely affect the operating partnership’s ability to pay its distributions to the parent company which will in turn adversely affect the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock 

should the parent company face a situation in which the operating partnership does not have sufficient cash available through its operations to continue operating its business as usual including making its distributions to the parent company the operating partnership may need to find alternative ways to increase the operating partnership’s liquidity such alternatives which would be done through the operating partnership may include without limitation divesting itself of properties and decreasing the operating partnership’s cash distribution to the parent company other alternatives are for the parent company to pay some or all of its dividends in stock rather than cash or issuing its equity in public or private transactions whether or not at favorable pricing or on favorable terms 

 

if the operating partnership is unable to obtain new financing or refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions then its cash flow may be insufficient to pay its distributions to the parent company which will have as a result insufficient funds to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the operating partnership’s interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase this increased interest expense of the operating partnership would adversely affect the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the market price of its stock 

 

the operating partnership may from time to time seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases andor exchanges for the parent company’s equity securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions the parent company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

 

for the parent company to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its reit taxable income while historically the parent company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances the parent company’s own stock as a result of this distribution requirement the operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can the parent company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership’s working capital needs acquisitions and developments 

 

as circumstances warrant the parent company may issue equity securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis dependent upon market conditions and available pricing the parent company would contribute any such proceeds to the operating partnership which would then use the proceeds to repay debt including borrowings under its lines of credit to make acquisitions of properties portfolios of properties or us or foreign propertyowning or real estaterelated entities or platforms to invest in existing or newly created joint ventures or for general corporate purposes

the parent company anticipates that the operating partnership will be required to use proceeds from debt and equity financings including the issuance of equity by the parent company and the divestiture of properties in addition to cash from its operations to make its distribution payments and repay its maturing debt as it comes due however the parent company and the operating partnership may not be able to issue such securities on favorable terms or at all the parent company’s or the operating partnership’s inability to issue securities on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect the operating partnership’s financial condition results of operations and cash flow and its ability to pay distributions to the parent company which will in turn adversely affect the market price of the parent company’s stock and the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders 

cash flows generated by the operating partnership were sufficient to cover the operating partnership’s distributions for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 including its distributions to the parent company which were in turn paid to the parent company’s stockholders as dividends cash flows from the operating partnership’s real estate operations and private capital businesses which are included in “net cash provided by operating activities” in the parent company’s cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from the operating partnership’s real estate development and operations businesses which are included in “net proceeds from divestiture of real estate and securities” in the parent company’s cash flows from investing activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows were sufficient to pay dividends on the parent company’s common stock and preferred stock distributions on common and preferred limited partnership units of the operating partnership and amb property ii lp and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the parent company uses proceeds from the operating partnership included in cash flows from investing activities specifically the proceeds from sales and contributions of properties as part of its real estate development and operations businesses to fund dividends and distributions not covered by cash flows from operating activities if any

if the operating partnership is unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions then its cash flow may be insufficient to pay cash distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase this increased interest expense would adversely affect its financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay cash distributions to its unitholders and make payments to its noteholders 

 

the operating partnership may from time to time seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases andor exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions its liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

 

a downgrade in the operating partnership’s credit ratings on its long term debt could adversely affect its business and financial condition a decrease in the operating partnership’s credit ratings could cause a negative reaction in the public and private markets for the parent company’s and the operating partnership’s securities increase difficulty in accessing optimally priced financing and damage public perception of the company’s business also if the longterm debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below current levels the borrowing cost of debt under the operating partnership’s unsecured credit facilities and certain term loans will increase in addition if the longterm debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below investment grade the operating partnership may be unable to request borrowings in currencies other than us dollars or japanese yen as applicable however the lack of other currency borrowings does not affect the operating partnership’s ability to fully draw down under the credit facilities or term loans also the operating partnership’s lenders will not be able to terminate its credit facilities or certain term loans in the event that its credit rating falls below investment grade status none of the operating partnership’s credit facilities contain covenants regarding the parent company’s stock price or market capitalization thus a decrease in the parent company’s stock price is not expected to impact the operating partnership’s ability to borrow under its existing lines of credit while the operating partnership currently does not expect its longterm debt ratings to fall below investment grade in the event that the ratings do fall below those levels it may be unable to exercise its options to extend the term of its credit facilities and the loss of the operating partnership’s ability to borrow in foreign currencies could affect its ability to optimally hedge its borrowings against foreign currency exchange rate changes 

 

in addition based on publicly available information regarding its lenders the operating partnership currently does not expect to lose borrowing capacity under its existing lines of credit as a result of a dissolution bankruptcy consolidation merger or other business combination among its lenders the operating partnership’s access to funds under its credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to the operating partnership if the operating partnership does not have sufficient cash flows and income from its operations to meet its financial commitments and lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to the operating partnership the operating partnership’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected

supplemental earnings measures 

 

funds from operations as adjusted “ffo as adjusted” and funds from operations per share and unit as adjusted “ffops as adjusted” 

 

the company believes that net income as defined by us gaap is the most appropriate earnings measure however the company considers funds from operations as adjusted or ffo as adjusted ffo per share and unit as adjusted or ffops as adjusted core ffo as adjusted and core ffo per share and unit as adjusted or core ffops as adjusted to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance the company defines ffops as adjusted as ffo as adjusted per fully diluted weighted average share of the parent company’s common stock and operating partnership units the company calculates ffo as adjusted as net income or loss available to common stockholders calculated in accordance with us gaap less gains or losses from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estaterelated depreciation and adjustments to derive the company’s pro rata share of ffo as adjusted of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures the company defines core ffops as adjusted as core ffo as adjusted per fully diluted weighted share of the parent company’s common stock and operating partnership units the company calculates core ffo as adjusted as ffo as adjusted excluding 

the company’s share of development profits these calculations also include adjustments for items as described below 

 

unless stated otherwise the company includes the gains from development including those from valueadded conversion projects before depreciation recapture as a component of ffo as adjusted the company believes gains from development should be included in ffo as adjusted to more completely reflect the performance of one of its lines of business the company believes that valueadded conversion dispositions are in substance land sales and as such should be included in ffo as adjusted consistent with the real estate investment trust industry’s long standing practice to include gains on the sale of land in funds from operations however the company’s interpretation of ffo as adjusted or ffops as adjusted may not be consistent with the views of others in the real estate investment trust industry who may consider it to be a divergence from the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” definition and may not be comparable to funds from operations or funds from operations per share and unit reported by other real estate investment trusts that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company does in connection with the formation of a joint venture the company may warehouse assets that are acquired with the intent to contribute these assets to the newly formed venture some of the properties held for contribution may under certain circumstances be required to be depreciated under us gaap if this circumstance arises the company intends to include in its calculation of ffo as adjusted gains or losses related to the contribution of previously depreciated real estate to joint ventures although such a change if instituted will be a departure from the current nareit definition the company believes such calculation of ffo as adjusted will better reflect the value created as a result of the contributions to date the company has not included gains or losses from the contribution of previously depreciated warehoused assets in ffo as adjusted 

 

in addition the company calculates ffo as adjusted to exclude impairment and restructuring charges debt extinguishment losses and the series d preferred unit redemption discount the impairment charges were principally a result of increases in estimated capitalization rates and deterioration in market conditions that adversely impacted values the restructuring charges reflected costs associated with the company’s reduction in global headcount and cost structure debt extinguishment losses generally included the costs of repurchasing debt securities the company repurchased certain tranches of senior unsecured debt to manage its debt maturities in response to the current financing environment resulting in greater debt extinguishment costs the series d preferred unit redemption discount reflects the gain associated with the discount to liquidation preference in the series d preferred unit redemption price less costs incurred as a result of the redemption in 2008 the company also recognized charges to writeoff pursuit costs related to development projects it no longer planned to commence and to establish a reserve against tax assets associated with the reduction of its development activities although difficult to predict these items may be recurring given the uncertainty of the current economic climate and its adverse effects on the real estate and financial markets while not infrequent or unusual in nature these items result from market fluctuations that can have inconsistent effects on the company’s results of operations the economics underlying these items reflect market and financing conditions in the shortterm but can obscure the company’s performance and the value of the company’s longterm investment decisions and strategies management believes ffo as adjusted is significant and useful to both it and its investors ffo as adjusted more appropriately reflects the value and strength of the company’s business model and its potential performance isolated from the volatility of the current economic environment and unobscured by costs or gains resulting from the company’s management of its financing profile in response to the tightening of the capital markets however in addition to the limitations of ffo measures as adjusted generally discussed below ffo as adjusted does not present a comprehensive measure of the company’s financial condition and operating performance this measure is a modification of the nareit definition of funds from operations and should not be used as an alternative to net income or cash as defined by us gaap 

 

the company believes that the ffo measures as adjusted are meaningful supplemental measures of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient thus the ffo measures as adjusted 

are supplemental measures of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization among other items from net income available to common stockholders as defined by us gaap the company believes that the use of the ffo measures as adjusted combined with the required us gaap presentations has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful the company considers the ffo measures as adjusted to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization the ffo measures as adjusted can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies while funds from operations and funds from operations per share are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts the ffo measures as adjusted do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by us gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating the company’s liquidity or operating performance the ffo measures as adjusted also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the company’s real estate assets nor are the ffo measures as adjusted necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the company’s future cash requirements management compensates for the limitations of the ffo measures as adjusted by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to us gaap along with this detailed discussion of the ffo measures as adjusted and a reconciliation of the ffo measures as adjusted to net income available to common stockholders a us gaap measurement 

the following table reflects the calculation of ffo as adjusted reconciled from net income loss available to common unitholders of the operating partnership and common stockholders of the parent company for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts

same store net operating income “ss noi” 

 

the company defines noi as rental revenues including reimbursements less property operating expenses noi excludes depreciation amortization general and administrative expenses restructuring charges real estate impairment losses development profits losses gains losses from sale or contribution of real estate interests and interest expense the company believes that net income as defined by gaap is the most appropriate earnings measure however noi is a useful supplemental measure calculated to help investors understand the company’s operating performance excluding the effects of gains losses costs and expenses which are not related to the performance of the assets noi is widely used by the real estate industry as a useful supplemental measure which helps investors compare the company’s operating performance with that of other companies real estate impairment losses have been excluded in deriving noi because the company does not consider its impairment losses to be a property operating expense the company believes that the exclusion of impairment losses from noi is a common methodology used in the real estate industry real estate impairment losses relate to the changing values of the company’s assets but do not reflect the current operating performance of the assets with respect to their revenues or expenses the company’s real estate impairment losses are noncash charges which represent the write down in the value of assets when estimated fair value over the holding period is lower than current carrying value the impairment charges were principally a result of increases in estimated capitalization rates and deterioration in market conditions that adversely impacted underlying real estate values therefore the impairment charges are not related to the current performance of the company’s real estate operations and should be excluded from its calculation of noi 

 

the company considers ss noi to be a useful supplemental measure of its operating performance for properties that are considered part of the same store pool the company defines cashbasis ss noi as noi on a same store basis excluding straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles the same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and excludes development properties for both the current and prior reporting periods the same store pool is set annually and excludes properties purchased and development stabilized after december 31 2008 the company considers ss noi to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure because it reflects the operating performance of the real estate portfolio excluding effects of noncash adjustments and provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a yearoveryear comparison in addition the company believes that ss noi helps investors compare the operating performance of its real estate as compared to other companies while ss noi is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating the company’s liquidity or operating performance ss noi also does not reflect general and administrative expenses interest expenses real estate impairment losses depreciation and amortization costs capital expenditures and leasing costs or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact the company’s results from operations further the company’s computation of ss noi may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating ss noi 

the following table reconciles ss noi cashbasis ss noi and cashbasis ss noi excluding lease termination fees from net loss for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 dollars in thousands

market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices interest rates and international exchange rates the company’s future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates accordingly the company manages its market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service acquisitions capital expenditures distributions to stockholders and unitholders payments to noteholders and other cash requirements the majority of the company’s outstanding debt has fixed interest rates which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates the company’s exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with its credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and its ability to incur more debt without stockholder and unitholder approval thereby increasing its debt service obligations which could adversely affect its cash flows

investment strategy 

 

the company’s investment strategy focuses on providing distribution space to customers whose businesses are tied to global trade and depend on the efficient movement of goods through the global supply chain the company’s properties are primarily located in the world’s busiest distribution markets featuring large supplyconstrained infill locations with dense populations and proximity to seaports airports and major freeway interchanges when measured by annualized base rent on an owned and managed basis a substantial majority of the company’s portfolio of industrial properties is located in its target markets and much of this is in infill submarkets infill locations are characterized by supply constraints on the availability of land for competing projects as well as 

physical political or economic barriers to new development the company believes that its facilities are essential to creating efficiencies in the supply chain and its business encompasses a blend of real estate global logistics and infrastructure 

 

in its target markets the company focuses on htd ® facilities industrial properties designed to facilitate the rapid distribution of its customers’ products rather than the long term storage of goods the company’s investment focus on htd ® assets is based on what it believes to be a global trend toward lower inventory levels and expedited supply chains htd ® facilities generally have a variety of physical and locational characteristics that allow for the rapid transport of goods from point to point these physical characteristics could include numerous dock doors shallower building depths fewer columns large truck courts and more space for trailer parking the company believes that these building characteristics help its customers to reduce their costs and become more efficient in their delivery systems the locational characteristics feature large supplyconstrained infill locations with dense populations and proximity to seaports airports and major freeway interchanges the company’s customers comprise logistics freight forwarding and airexpress companies with timesensitive needs that value facilities that are proximate to transportation infrastructure

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

business risks 

 

the company’s operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to it these risks include among others 

 

risks of the current economic environment 

 

disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 

recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions slower growth and recession in most major economies during 2009 although signs of recovery may exist there are continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation the availability and cost of credit a declining real estate market and geopolitical issues that contribute to increased market volatility and uncertain expectations for the global economy these conditions combined with declining business activity levels and consumer confidence increased unemployment and volatile oil prices contributed to unprecedented levels of volatility in the capital markets during 2009 any additional continued or recurring disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

 

as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit have been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide funding to businesses and consumers these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending while the company currently believes that it has sufficient working capital and capacity under its credit facilities in the near term continued or recurring turbulence in the global markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect its liquidity and financial condition as well as the liquidity and financial condition of its customers if these market conditions persist recur or worsen in the long term they may limit the company’s ability and the ability of its customers to timely replace maturing liabilities and access the credit markets to meet liquidity needs 

 

if the longterm debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below its current levels the borrowing cost of debt under its unsecured credit facilities and certain term loans may increase in addition if the longterm debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below investment grade it may be unable to request borrowings in currencies other than us dollars or japanese yen as applicable however the lack of other currency borrowings does not affect its ability to fully draw down under the credit facilities or term loans while the operating partnership currently does not expect its longterm debt ratings to fall below investment grade in the event that its ratings do fall below those levels it may be unable to exercise its options to extend the term of its credit facilities and the loss of its ability to borrow in foreign currencies could affect its ability to optimally hedge its borrowings against foreign currency exchange rate changes in addition the company cannot assure you that additional continuing or recurring longterm disruptions in the global economy and the continuation of tighter credit conditions among and potential failures of thirdparty financial institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an adverse effect on the operating partnership’s borrowing capacity and liquidity position the operating partnership’s access to funds under its credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to the operating partnership the company cannot assure you that if one of the operating partnership’s lenders fails some of whom are lenders under a number of the operating partnership’s facilities the operating partnership will be successful in finding a replacement lender and as a result its borrowing capacity under the applicable facilities may be permanently reduced if the company does not have sufficient cash flows and income from its operations to meet its financial commitments and those lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to the operating partnership the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

certain of the company’s thirdparty indebtedness is held by the company’s consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures in the event that the company’s joint venture partner is unable to meet its obligations under the joint venture agreements or the thirdparty debt agreements the company may elect to pay its joint venture partner’s portion of debt to avoid foreclosure on the mortgaged property or permit the lender to foreclose on the mortgaged property to meet the joint venture’s debt obligations in either case the company could face a loss of income and asset value on the property 

 

there can be no assurance that the markets will stabilize in the near future or that the company will choose to or be able to increase its levels of capital deployment at such time or ever in addition a continued increase in the cost of credit and inability to access the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the occupancy of the company’s properties the disposition of its properties private capital raising and contribution of properties to its coinvestment ventures for example an inability to fully lease the company’s properties may result in such properties not meeting the company’s investment criteria for contributions to its coinvestment ventures if the company is unable to contribute completed development properties to its coinvestment ventures or sell its completed development projects to third parties the company will not be able to recognize gains from the contribution or sale of such properties and as a result the net income available to the parent company’s common stockholders and its funds from operations will decrease additionally business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect the company’s customers may adversely impact its business and financial condition furthermore general uncertainty in the real estate markets has resulted in conditions where the pricing of certain real estate assets may be difficult due to uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and valuations among other things which may add to the difficulty of buyers or the company’s coinvestment ventures to obtain financing on favorable terms to acquire such properties or cause potential buyers to not complete acquisitions of such properties the market uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and real estate valuations also adversely impacts the company’s net asset value in addition the operating partnership may face difficulty in refinancing its mortgage debt or may be unable to refinance such debt at all if its property values significantly decline such a decline may also cause a default under the loantovalue covenants in some of the company’s joint ventures’ mortgage debt which may require its joint ventures to remargin or pay down a portion of the applicable debt there can be no assurance however that in such an event the company will be able to do so to prevent foreclosure 

 

in the event that the company does not have sufficient cash available to it through its operations to continue operating its business as usual the company may need to find alternative ways to increase its liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation divesting itself of properties whether or not they otherwise meet the company’s strategic objectives to keep in the long term at less than optimal terms issuing and selling its debt and equity in public or private transactions under less than optimal conditions entering into leases with its customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with its existing customers without an increase in rental rates at turnover there can be no assurance however that such alternative ways to increase the company’s liquidity will be available to the company additionally taking such measures to increase the company’s liquidity may adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

 

as of december 31 2009 the company had 1872 million in cash and cash equivalents the company’s available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in its operating accounts the invested cash is invested in money market funds that invest solely in direct obligations of the government of the united states or in time deposits with certain financial institutions to date the company has experienced no loss or lack of access to its invested cash or cash equivalents however the company can provide no assurances that access to its invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

 

at any point in time the company also has a significant amount of cash deposits in its operating accounts that are with thirdparty financial institutions and as of december 31 2009 the amount in such deposits was approximately 1594 million on a consolidated basis these balances exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits while the company monitors daily the cash balances in its operating accounts and adjusts the cash balances as appropriate these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets to date the company has experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in its operating accounts 

the price per share of the parent company’s stock may decline or fluctuate significantly 

 

the market price per share of the parent company’s common stock may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including 

 

  

many of the factors listed above are beyond the company’s control these factors may cause the market price of shares of the parent company’s common stock to decline regardless of its financial condition results of operations business or its prospects 

 

debt financing risks 

 

the company faces risks associated with the use of debt to fund its business activities including refinancing and interest rate risks 

 

as of december 31 2009 the operating partnership had total debt outstanding of 32 billion as of december 31 2009 the parent company guaranteed 12 billion of the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in the parent company’s financial statements the operating partnership is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest it is likely that the operating partnership will need 

to refinance at least a portion of its outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that the operating partnership may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of its existing debt if the operating partnership is unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions then the operating partnership expects that its cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all such maturing debt and to pay distributions to its unitholders including the parent company which in turn will be unable to pay cash dividends to its stockholders furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase higher interest rates on newly incurred debt may negatively impact the operating partnership as well if interest rates increase the operating partnership’s interest costs and overall costs of capital will increase which could adversely affect its financial condition results of operation and cash flow the market price of the parent company’s stock the operating partnership’s ability to pay principal and interest on its debt and to pay distributions to its unitholders the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the operating partnership’s capital deployment activity in addition there may be circumstances that will require the operating partnership to obtain amendments or waivers to provisions in its credit facilities or other financings there can be no assurance that the operating partnership will be able to obtain necessary amendments or waivers at all or without significant expense in such case the operating partnership may not be able to fund its business activities as planned within budget or at all 

 

in addition if the company mortgages one or more of its properties to secure payment of indebtedness and the company is unable to meet mortgage payments then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the lender with a consequent loss of income and asset value a foreclosure on one or more of the company’s properties could adversely affect its financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders and cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock 

 

as of december 31 2009 the company had outstanding bank guarantees in the amount of 04 million used to secure contingent obligations primarily obligations under development and purchase agreements as of december 31 2009 the company also guaranteed 479 million and 1067 million on outstanding loans for six of its consolidated coinvestment ventures and four of its unconsolidated coinvestment ventures respectively also the company has entered into contribution agreements with certain of its unconsolidated coinvestment venture funds these contribution agreements require the company to make additional capital contributions to the applicable coinvestment venture fund upon certain defaults by the coinvestment venture of its debt obligations to the lenders such additional capital contributions will cover all or part of the applicable coinvestment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater than the company’s share of the coinvestment venture’s debt obligation or the value of the company’s share of any property securing such debt the company’s contribution obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the property if any used to secure the debt and obtained by the lender upon default the company’s potential obligations under these contribution agreements were 2606 million as of december 31 2009 the company intends to continue to guarantee debt of its unconsolidated coinvestment venture funds and make additional contributions to its unconsolidated coinvestment venture funds in connection with property contributions to the funds such payment obligations under such guarantees and contribution obligations under such contribution agreements if required to be paid could be of a magnitude that could adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock 

 

adverse changes in the company’s credit ratings could negatively affect its financing activity 

 

the credit ratings of the operating partnership’s senior unsecured longterm debt and the parent company’s preferred stock are based on its operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of the company the company’s credit ratings can affect the amount of capital it can access as well as the terms and pricing of any debt the operating partnership may incur there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its current credit ratings and in the event its current credit ratings are downgraded the company would likely incur higher borrowing costs 

and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing also a downgrade in the company’s credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under its current and future credit facilities and debt instruments for example if the operating partnership’s credit ratings of its senior unsecured longterm debt are downgraded to below investment grade levels the operating partnership may not be able to obtain or maintain extensions on certain of its existing debt adverse changes in the operating partnership’s credit ratings could negatively impact its refinancing and other capital market activities its ability to manage its debt maturities its future growth its financial condition the market price of the parent company’s stock and its development and acquisition activity 

 

covenants in the operating partnership’s debt agreements could adversely affect its financial condition 

 

the terms of the operating partnership’s credit agreements and other indebtedness require that it complies with a number of financial and other covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit flexibility in the operating partnership’s operations and its failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement even if it has satisfied its payment obligations as of december 31 2009 the operating partnership had certain nonrecourse secured loans which are crosscollateralized by multiple properties if the operating partnership defaults on any of these loans it may then be required to repay such indebtedness together with applicable prepayment charges to avoid foreclosure on all the crosscollateralized properties within the applicable pool foreclosure on the operating partnership’s properties or its inability to refinance its loans on favorable terms could adversely impact its financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders or distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock in addition the operating partnership’s credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain crossdefault provisions which are triggered in the event that its other material indebtedness is in default these crossdefault provisions may require the operating partnership to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default which could adversely affect the operating partnership’s financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay distributions to its unitholders and the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the market price of its stock 

 

failure to hedge effectively against exchange and interest rates may adversely affect results of operations 

 

the company seeks to manage its exposure to exchange and interest rate volatility by using exchange and interest rate hedging arrangements such as cap agreements and swap agreements these agreements involve risks such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing the company’s exposure to exchange or interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable hedging may reduce overall returns on the company’s investments failure to hedge effectively against exchange and interest rate changes may materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

 

the company is dependent on external sources of capital 

 

in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust the parent company is required each year to distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of its real estate investment trust taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain and is subject to tax to the extent its income is not fully distributed while historically the parent company has satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to its stockholders the parent company may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december 31 2011 and in some cases declared as late as december 31 2012 recent internal revenue service guidance allows the parent company to satisfy up to 90 of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of its stock if certain conditions are met assuming the parent company continues to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash the parent company and the operating partnership may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on thirdparty sources of capital further in 

order to maintain the parent company’s real estate investment trust status and avoid the payment of federal income and excise taxes the parent company through the operating partnership may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the real estate investment trust distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments the company’s ability to access private debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of the company’s growth potential its current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of its securities 

 

the operating partnership could incur more debt increasing its debt service 

 

as of december 31 2009 the operating partnership’s share of total debttoits share of total market capitalization ratio was 465 the operating partnership’s definition of “the operating partnership’s share of total market capitalization” is the operating partnership’s share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity see footnote 1 to the capitalization ratios table contained in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation — liquidity and capital resources” for the operating partnership’s definitions of “market equity” and “the operating partnership’s share of total debt” as this ratio percentage increases directly with a decrease in the market price per share of the parent company’s capital stock an unstable market environment will impact this ratio in a volatile manner there can also be no assurance that the operating partnership would not become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to its unitholders and in turn the cash available to distribute to the parent company’s stockholders furthermore if the operating partnership becomes more highly leveraged the operating partnership may not be in compliance with the debt covenants contained in the agreements governing its coinvestment ventures which could adversely impact its private capital business 

 

other real estate industry risks 

 

the company’s performance and value are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with its real estate assets 

 

the investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the properties as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties if the company’s properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures then the operating partnership’s ability to pay distributions to its unitholders including the parent company and in turn the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders could be adversely affected in addition there are significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate such as mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs that generally do not decline when circumstances reduce the income from the property income from and the value of the company’s properties may be adversely affected by 

 

 16 

 

in addition periods of economic slowdown or recession in the united states and in other countries rising interest rates diminished access to or availability of capital or declining demand for real estate may result in a general decrease in rents an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases or greater difficulty in financing the company’s acquisition and development activities which would adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations future terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity which could reduce the demand for and the value of the company’s properties to the extent that future attacks impact the company’s customers their businesses similarly could be adversely affected including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases 

 

the company’s properties are concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector as a result of this concentration the company feels the impact of an economic downturn in this sector more acutely than if the company’s portfolio included other property types 

 

declining real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely affect the company’s earnings and financial condition 

 

the current economic downturn has generally resulted in lower real estate valuations which has required the company to recognize real estate impairment charges on its assets the company conducts a comprehensive review of all real estate asset classes in accordance with its policy of accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets which indicates that asset values should be analyzed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable the intended use of an asset either held for sale or held for the long term can significantly impact how impairment is measured if an asset is intended to be held for the long term the impairment analysis is based on a twostep test the first test measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding period including a residual value undiscounted and without interest charges against the carrying value of the property if the asset fails the first test then the asset carrying value is measured against the estimated fair value from a market participant standpoint with the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the estimated fair value recognized as an impairment charge to earnings if an asset is intended to be sold impairment is tested based on a onestep test comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value less costs to sell the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital the company determines the estimated fair values based on assumptions regarding rental rates costs to complete leaseup and holding periods as well as sales prices or contribution values the company also utilizes the knowledge of its regional teams and the recent valuations of its two openended funds which contain a large geographically diversified pool of assets all of which are subject to thirdparty appraisals on at least an annual basis as a result of changing market conditions the company reevaluated the carrying value of its investments and recognized real estate impairment losses of 1819 million during the year ended december 31 2009 on certain of its investments 

 

the principal trigger which led to the impairment charges was the severe economic deterioration in some markets resulting in a decrease in leasing and rental rates rising vacancies and an increase in capitalization rates additional impairments may be necessary in the future in the event that market conditions continue to deteriorate and impact the factors used to estimate fair value which may include impairments relating to the company’s unconsolidated real estate as well as impairments relating to the company’s investments in its unconsolidated coinvestment ventures investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are presented under the equity method the equity method is used when the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the joint venture but does not have control of the joint venture under the equity method these investments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the company’s proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the joint venture distributions received contributions deferred gains from the contribution of properties and certain other adjustments as appropriate when circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity investment the company evaluates the investment for impairment by estimating the company’s ability to recover its investment or if the loss in value is other than temporary to evaluate whether an impairment is other than temporary the company considers relevant factors including but not limited to the period of time in any unrealized loss position the likelihood of a future recovery and the company’s positive intent and ability to hold the investment until the forecasted recovery if the company determines the loss in value is other than temporary the company recognizes an impairment charge to reflect the 

investment at fair value fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including but not limited to discounted cash flow models quoted market values and third party appraisals during the year ended december 31 2009 the company did not record any impairment on its investments in unconsolidated coinvestment ventures there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions the company uses to assess impairments are accurate and will reflect actual results a worsening real estate market may cause the company to reevaluate the assumptions used in its impairment analysis and its intent to hold sell develop or contribute properties impairment charges could adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations and its ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock see part iv item 15 note 3 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a more detailed discussion of the real estate impairment losses recorded in the company’s results of operations

the company could be adversely affected if a significant number of its customers are unable to meet their lease obligations 

 

the company’s results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of the parent company’s stock would be adversely affected if a significant number of the company’s customers were unable to meet their lease obligations in the current economic environment it is likely that customer bankruptcies will increase if a customer seeks the protection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws such customer’s lease may be terminated in the process and result in a reduction of cash flow to the company in the event of a significant number of lease defaults andor tenant bankruptcies the company’s cash flow may not be sufficient to pay distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders and cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and repay maturing debt and any other obligations as of december 31 2009 on an owned and managed basis the company did not have any single customer account for annualized base rent revenues greater than 36 however in the event of lease defaults by a significant number of the company’s customers the company may incur substantial costs in enforcing its rights as landlord

from time to time certain of the company’s executive officers and directors may own interests in other realestate related businesses and investments including de minimis holdings of the equity securities of public and private real estate companies the company’s executive officers’ involvement in other real estaterelated activities could divert their attention from the company’s daytoday operations the company’s executive officers have entered into noncompetition agreements with the company pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities directly or indirectly in respect of commercial real estate and not to make any investment in respect of 

any industrial or retail real estate other than through ownership of not more than 5 of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through certain specified investments state law may limit the company’s ability to enforce these agreements the company will not acquire any properties from its executive officers directors or their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and independent as defined by the rules of the new york stock exchange members of the parent company’s board of directors with respect to that transaction

risks associated with government regulations 

 

the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and any related potential liability could exceed the company’s budgets for these items 

 

under various environmental laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at on under in or from its property the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial these laws typically impose liability and cleanup responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination 

 

environmental laws in some countries including the united states also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of the company’s properties are known to contain asbestoscontaining building materials 

 

in addition some of the company’s properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances further certain of the company’s properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time the company may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions where the company believes that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in such an instance the company underwrites the costs of environmental investigation cleanup and monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtains appropriate environmental insurance for the property further in connection with certain divested properties the company has agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties 

at the time of acquisition the company subjects all of its properties to a phase i or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants and the company may have additional phase ii testing performed upon the consultant’s recommendation these environmental assessments have not revealed and the company is not aware of any environmental liability that it believes would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole nonetheless it is possible that the assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities unknown to the company or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are greater than the company anticipated further the company’s properties’ current environmental condition may be affected by customers the condition of land operations in the vicinity of the properties such as releases from underground storage tanks or by unrelated third parties if the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed the company’s budgets for these items then the company’s financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock could be adversely affected 

 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs 

 

under the americans with disabilities act places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants if the company is required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the americans with disabilities act including removing access barriers then the company’s cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders may be adversely affected the company’s properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and lifesafety requirements the company could incur fines or private damage awards if it fails to comply with these requirements while the company believes that its properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by the company that will affect its cash flow and results of operations 

 

federal income tax risks 

 

the parent company’s failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have serious adverse consequences to its stockholders 

 

the parent company elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “internal revenue code” commencing with its taxable year ended december 31 1997 the parent company believes it has operated so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code and believes that the parent company’s current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable it to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust however it is possible that the parent company has been organized or has operated in a manner that would not allow it to qualify as a real estate investment trust or that the parent company’s future operations could cause it to fail to qualify qualification as a real estate investment trust requires the parent company to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex sections of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the parent company’s control for example in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust the parent company must derive at least 95 of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition the parent company must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its real estate investment trust taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis while historically the parent company has satisfied the distribution requirement discussed above by making cash distributions to its stockholders the parent company may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december 31 2011 and in some cases declared as late as december 31 2012 recent internal revenue 

service guidance allows the parent company to satisfy up to 90 of this distribution requirement through the distribution of shares of its stock if certain conditions are met the provisions of the internal revenue code and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a real estate investment trust are more complicated in the parent company’s case because it holds its assets through the operating partnership legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification however the parent company is not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect its ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust 

 

if the parent company fails to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year the parent company will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates unless the parent company is entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions the parent company would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which the parent company lost its qualification if the parent company lost its real estate investment trust status the parent company’s net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved in addition the parent company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders 

 

furthermore the parent company owns a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit the parent company’s interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and any dividend income or gains derived by the parent company from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit gross income tests to qualify as a reit the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions did not apply it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to united states federal income tax in addition a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect on the parent company’s ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus the parent company’s ability to qualify as a reit 

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction 

 

from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties including by contributing properties to its coinvestment venture funds under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax the company does not believe that its transfers or disposals of property or its contributions of properties into its coinvestment ventures are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by the company or contributions of properties into the company’s coinvestment venture funds are prohibited transactions while the company believes that the internal revenue service would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to the company from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect the company’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust 

 

the parent company may in the future choose to pay dividends in its own stock in which case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive 

 

the parent company may distribute taxable dividends that are partially payable in cash and partially payable in its stock under recent irs guidance up to 90 of any such taxable dividend with respect to calendar years 2008 through 2011 and in some cases declared as late as december 31 2012 could be payable in the parent company’s stock if certain conditions are met taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full 

amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of the parent company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits for united states federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of the parent company’s stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders the parent company may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition if a significant number of the parent company’s stockholders determine to sell shares of its stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends it may put downward pressure on the trading price of the parent company’s stock 

 

legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect the parent company’s stockholders 

 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax laws applicable to investments in reits and similar entities additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future and there can be no assurance that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of the parent company the operating partnership any stockholder of the parent company or any limited partner of the operating partnership 

 

risks associated with ownership of the parent company’s stock 

 

limitations in the parent company’s charter and bylaws could prevent a change in control 

 

certain provisions of the parent company’s charter and bylaws may delay defer or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of the parent company’s common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for the common stock to maintain the parent company’s qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of the parent company’s outstanding stock may be owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made furthermore the parent company’s common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12month taxable year or a proportionate part of a short tax year in addition if the parent company or an owner of 10 or more of the parent company’s stock actually or constructively owns 10 or more of one of the parent company’s customers or a customer of any partnership in which the company is a partner then the rent received by the parent company either directly or through any such partnership from that customer will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the internal revenue code to help the parent company maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes the parent company prohibits the ownership actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the internal revenue code by any single person of more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the issued and outstanding shares of each of the parent company’s common stock series l preferred stock series m preferred stock series o preferred stock and series p preferred stock unless such limitations are waived by the parent company’s board of directors the parent company refers to this limitation as the “ownership limit” the charter provides that shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary the charter further provides that any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale a transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances the ownership limit may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control and therefore could adversely affect the parent company’s stockholders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for the shares of the parent company’s common stock in connection with such transaction 

 

the parent company’s charter authorizes it to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that the parent company issues the parent company’s board of directors could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction including a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the parent company’s stockholders 

the parent company’s charter and bylaws and maryland law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without the approval of the parent company’s board of directors which in turn may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control the parent company’s charter and bylaws include the following provisions 

 

  

maryland law includes the following provisions 

 

  

in addition the parent company’s board could elect to adopt without stockholder approval other provisions under maryland law that may impede a change in control 

 

if the parent company issues additional securities then the investment of existing stockholders will be diluted 

 

as the parent company is a real estate investment trust the company is dependent on external sources of capital and the parent company may issue common or preferred stock and the operating partnership may issue debt securities to fund the company’s future capital needs the company has the authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities and to cause the operating partnership or amb property ii lp one of the company’s subsidiaries to issue limited partnership units in exchange for property or otherwise existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by the operating partnership amb property ii lp or the parent company and any issuance of additional equity securities may adversely affect the market price of the parent company’s stock and could result in dilution of an existing stockholder’s investment 

 

earnings cash dividends asset value and market interest rates affect the price of the parent company’s stock 

 

as the parent company is a real estate investment trust the market value of the parent company’s equity securities in general is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the parent company’s growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash dividends the market value of the parent company’s equity securities is based secondarily upon the market value of its underlying real estate assets for this reason shares of the parent company’s stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than its net asset value per share to the extent that the parent company retains operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of the parent company’s underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of its stock the parent company’s failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of the parent company’s stock further the distribution yield on the stock as a percentage of the price of the stock relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of the parent company’s stock an increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of the parent company’s stock to expect a higher distribution yield which would adversely affect the parent company’s stock’s market price additionally if the market price of the parent company’s stock declines significantly then the operating partnership might breach certain covenants with respect to its debt obligations which could adversely affect the company’s liquidity and ability to make future 

acquisitions and the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the operating partnership’s ability to pay distributions to its unitholders 

 

the parent company’s board of directors has decided to align the parent company’s regular dividend payments with the projected taxable income from recurring operations alone the parent company may make special distributions going forward as necessary related to taxable income associated with any asset dispositions and gain activity in the past the parent company’s board of directors has suspended dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and it is possible that they may do so again in the future or decide to pay dividends in the parent company’s own stock as provided for in the internal revenue code 

 

the parent company could change its investment and financing policies without a vote of stockholders 

 

subject to the parent company’s current investment policy to maintain the parent company’s qualification as a real estate investment trust unless a change is approved by the parent company’s board of directors under certain circumstances the parent company’s board of directors determines the company’s investment and financing policies its growth strategy and its debt capitalization distribution and operating policies the parent company’s board of directors may revise or amend these strategies and policies at any time without a vote of stockholders any such changes may not serve the interests of all of the parent company’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s unitholders and could adversely affect the company’s financial condition or results of operations including its ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders 

 

shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of the parent company’s common stock 

 

the operating partnership and amb property ii lp had 3376141 common limited partnership units issued and outstanding as of december 31 2009 all of which are currently exchangeable on a oneforone basis into shares of the parent company’s common stock in the future the operating partnership or amb property ii lp may issue additional limited partnership units and the parent company may issue shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of properties or in private placements these shares of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets over time pursuant to registration rights that the parent company has granted or may grant in connection with future issuances or pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act of 1933 in addition common stock issued under the company’s stock option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that the parent company has filed or pursuant to rule 144 as of december 31 2009 under the company’s stock option and incentive plans the company had 6079937 shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance had outstanding options to purchase 8107697 shares of common stock of which 5807455 are vested and exercisable and 3200220 have exercise prices below market value at december 31 2009 and had 918753 unvested restricted shares of common stock outstanding future sales of a substantial number of shares of the parent company’s common stock in the market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of the parent company’s common stock further the existence of the common limited partnership units of the operating partnership and amb property ii lp and the shares of the parent company’s common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the exercise of options and registration rights referred to above may adversely affect the terms upon which the parent company is able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities 

 

risks associated with the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

 

the company’s business could be adversely impacted if it has deficiencies in its disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 

 

the design and effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management will continue to review the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over 

financial reporting there can be no guarantee that the company’s internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time furthermore the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting with respect to entities that the company does not control or manage or thirdparty entities that the company may acquire may be substantially more limited than those the company maintains with respect to the subsidiaries that the company has controlled or managed over the course of time deficiencies including any material weakness in the company’s internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of the company’s results of operations restatements of its financial statements a decline in the parent company’s stock price or otherwise materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations financial condition or liquidity

the following table identifies types and characteristics of the company’s industrial buildings and each type’s percentage based on square footage of the company’s total owned and managed operating portfolio 

 

 

 

lease terms the company’s industrial properties are typically subject to leases on a “triple net basis” in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance and operating costs or are subject to leases on a “modified gross basis” in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels in addition most of the company’s leases include fixed rental increases or consumer price indexbased rental increases lease terms typically range from three to ten years with a weighted average of six years excluding renewal options however the majority of the company’s industrial leases do not include renewal options 

overview of our global market presence the company’s industrial properties are located in the following markets 

 

 

 

within these metropolitan areas the company’s industrial properties are generally concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established relatively large submarkets which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere these infill locations are typically near major airports or seaports or convenient to major highway systems and rail lines and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools there is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrallylocated submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses including warehouse distribution light assembly and manufacturing the company generally avoids locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties

as of december 31 2009 the company’s total consolidated debt maturities for 2010 after extension options subject to certain conditions were 3224 million excluding principal amortization the company had unconsolidated debt maturities of 1482 million for 2010 after extension options subject to certain conditions as of december 31 2009 excluding principal amortization

critical accounting policies 

 

the company’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods the company evaluates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

investments in real estate investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered in which case an adjustment to the carrying value of the property is made to reduce it to its estimated fair value the company also regularly reviews the impact of above or belowmarket leases inplace leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions and records an intangible asset or liability accordingly 

 

the company conducts a comprehensive review of all real estate asset classes in accordance with its policy of accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets which indicates that asset values should be analyzed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable the intended use of an asset either held for sale or held for the long term can significantly impact how impairment is measured if an asset is intended to be held for the long term the impairment analysis is based on a twostep test the first test measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding period including a residual value undiscounted and without interest charges against the carrying value of the property if the asset fails the test then the asset carrying value is measured against the estimated fair value from a market participant standpoint with the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the estimated fair value recognized as an impairment charge to earnings if an asset is intended to be sold impairment is tested based on a onestep test comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value less costs to sell the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital the company determines the estimated fair values based on assumptions regarding rental rates costs to complete leaseup and holding periods as well as sales prices or contribution values the company also utilizes the knowledge of its regional teams and the recent valuations of its two openended funds which contain a large geographically diversified pool of assets all of which are subject to thirdparty appraisals on at least an annual basis 

 

revenue recognition the company records rental revenue from operating leases on a straightline basis over the term of the leases and maintains an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of the company’s customers to make required payments if customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts security deposits and letters of credit then the company may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods the company monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its customers on an ongoing basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate each period the company reviews its outstanding accounts receivable including straightline rents for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed the company also records lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with the company and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to the company if a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s occupancy 

 

property dispositions the company reports real estate dispositions in four separate categories on its consolidated statements of operations first when the company divests a portion of its interests in real estate entities or properties gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by thirdparty investors for cash and are included in gains from sale or contribution of real estate interests in the statements of operations second the company disposes of valueadded conversion projects and buildtosuit and speculative development projects for which it has not generated material operating income prior to sale the gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes when applicable and is included in development profits net of taxes within continuing operations of the statements of operations third the company disposes of valueadded conversion and other redevelopment projects for which it may have generated material operating income prior to sale the gain or loss recognized is reported net of estimated taxes when applicable in the development profits net of taxes line within discontinued operations lastly guidance related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets requires the company to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to industrial operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties which is included in development profits and gains from sale of real estate interests net of taxes in the statements of operations the consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also retrospectively adjusted to conform with new guidance regarding accounting for discontinued operations and noncontrolling interests and there is no impact on the company’s previously reported consolidated financial position net income or 

cash flows in all cases gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are presented under the equity method under the equity method these investments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the company’s proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the joint venture distributions received contributions deferred gains from the contribution of properties and certain other adjustments as appropriate when circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity investment the company evaluates the investment for impairment by estimating the company’s ability to recover its investment or if the loss in value is other than temporary to evaluate whether an impairment is other than temporary the company considers relevant factors including but not limited to the period of time in any unrealized loss position the likelihood of a future recovery and the company’s positive intent and ability to hold the investment until the forecasted recovery if the company determines the loss in value is other than temporary the company recognizes an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including but not limited to discounted cash flow models quoted market values and third party appraisals

primarily due to increased occupancy at several of the company’s development projects other industrial revenues include rental revenues from development projects that have reached certain levels of operation but are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties the decrease in these revenues of 70 million primarily reflects a decline in occupancy in 2009 the decrease in private capital revenues of 306 million was primarily due to a decrease in incentive and acquisition fees recognized in 2009 from fees recognized in the prior year in 2009 the company recognized incentive distributions of 29 million for amb dfs fund i llc and in 2008 the company received incentive distributions of 330 million for amb institutional alliance fund iii lp and 10 million in connection with the sale of the partnership interests in amberie lp including its final real estate asset to amb institutional alliance fund iii lp

investment in the operating partnership therefore the assets and liabilities of the parent company and the operating partnership are the same on their respective financial statements however all debt is held directly or indirectly at the operating partnership level and the parent company has guaranteed some of the operating partnership’s secured and unsecured debt as discussed below as the parent company consolidates the operating partnership the section entitled “liquidity and capital resources of the operating partnership” should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the company on a consolidated basis and how the company is operated as a whole 

 

capital resources of the parent company

please see “explanatory note” on page 1 and part iv item 15 note 11 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of the noncontrolling interests of the parent company 

 

in order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles the parent company presently intends over the long term to operate with a parent company’s share of total debttoparent company’s share of total market capitalization ratio or parent company’s share of total debttoparent company’s share of total assets of approximately 45 or less in order to operate at this targeted ratio over the long term the parent company is currently exploring various options to monetize its development assets through possible contribution to funds where capacity is available the formation of joint ventures and the sale to third parties it is also exploring the potential sale of industrial operating assets to further enhance liquidity as of december 31 2009 the parent company’s share of total debttoparent company’s share of total assets ratio was 436 see footnote 1 to the capitalization ratios table below for the definitions of “parent company’s share of total market capitalization” “market equity” “parent company’s share of total debt” and “parent company’s share of total assets” the parent company typically finances its coinvestment ventures with secured debt at a loantovalue ratio of 5065 pursuant to its coinvestment venture agreements additionally the operating partnership currently intends to manage its capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on its senior unsecured debt regardless of these policies however the parent company’s and operating partnership’s organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that either entity may incur accordingly management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder or unitholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render the parent company or the operating partnership unable to comply with these policies for example decreases in the market 

price of the parent company’s common stock have caused an increase in the ratio of parent company’s share of total debttoparent company’s share of total market capitalization 

 

 

 

 

  

liquidity of the parent company 

 

the liquidity of the parent company is dependent on the operating partnership’s ability to make sufficient distributions to the parent company the primary cash requirement of the parent company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders the parent company also guarantees some of the operating partnership’s secured and unsecured debt described in the “debt guarantees” section below if the operating partnership fails to fulfill its debt requirements which trigger parent guarantee obligations then the parent company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees 

 

the parent company believes the operating partnership’s sources of working capital specifically its cash flow from operations and borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the parent company and in turn for the parent company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders however there can be no assurance that the operating partnership’s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs including its ability to make distribution payments to the parent company the unavailability of capital could adversely affect the operating partnership’s ability to pay its distributions to the parent company which will in turn adversely affect the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock 

 

should the parent company face a situation in which the operating partnership does not have sufficient cash available through its operations to continue operating its business as usual including making its distributions to the parent company the operating partnership may need to find alternative ways to increase the operating partnership’s 

liquidity such alternatives which would be done through the operating partnership may include without limitation divesting itself of properties and decreasing the operating partnership’s cash distribution to the parent company other alternatives are for the parent company to pay some or all of its dividends in stock rather than cash or issuing its equity in public or private transactions whether or not at favorable pricing or on favorable terms 

 

if the operating partnership is unable to obtain new financing or refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions then its cash flow may be insufficient to pay its distributions to the parent company which will have as a result insufficient funds to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the operating partnership’s interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase this increased interest expense of the operating partnership would adversely affect the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the market price of its stock 

 

the operating partnership may from time to time seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases andor exchanges for the parent company’s equity securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions the parent company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

 

for the parent company to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its taxable income while historically the parent company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances the parent company’s own stock as a result of this distribution requirement the operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can the parent company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership’s working capital needs acquisitions and developments 

 

as circumstances warrant the parent company may issue equity securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis dependent upon market conditions and available pricing the parent company would contribute any such proceeds to the operating partnership which would then use the proceeds to repay debt including borrowings under its lines of credit to make acquisitions of properties portfolios of properties or us or foreign propertyowning or real estaterelated entities or for general corporate purposes 

 

dividends the following table sets forth the parent company’s dividends paid or payable per share for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

the parent company anticipates that the operating partnership will be required to use proceeds from debt and equity financings including the issuance of equity by the parent company and the divestiture of properties in addition to cash from its operations to make its distribution payments and repay its maturing debt as it comes due however the parent company and the operating partnership may not be able to issue such securities on favorable terms or at all the parent company’s or the operating partnership’s inability to issue securities on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect the operating partnership’s financial condition results of operations and cash flow and its ability to pay distributions to the parent company which will in turn adversely affect the market price of the parent company’s stock and the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders 

cash flows generated by the operating partnership were sufficient to cover the operating partnership’s distributions for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 including its distributions to the parent company which were in turn paid to the parent company’s stockholders as dividends cash flows from the operating partnership’s real estate operations and private capital businesses which are included in “net cash provided by operating activities” in the parent company’s cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from the operating partnership’s real estate development and operations businesses which are included in “net proceeds from divestiture of real estate” in the parent company’s cash flows from investing activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows were sufficient to pay dividends on the parent company’s common stock and preferred stock distributions on common and preferred limited partnership units of the operating partnership and amb property ii lp and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 for the year ended december 31 2007 cash flows from operating activities alone were not sufficient to pay such dividends and distributions as shown in the table below the parent company uses proceeds from the operating partnership included in cash flows from investing activities specifically the proceeds from sales and contributions of properties as part of its real estate development and operations businesses to fund dividends and distributions not covered by cash flows from operating activities if any

if the operating partnership is unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions then its cash flow may be insufficient to pay cash distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase this increased interest expense would adversely affect its financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay cash distributions to its unitholders and make payments to its noteholders 

 

the operating partnership may from time to time seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases andor exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions its liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

 

if the longterm debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below current levels the borrowing cost of debt under the operating partnership’s unsecured credit facilities and certain term loans will increase in addition if the longterm debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below investment grade the operating partnership may be unable to request borrowings in currencies other than us dollars or japanese yen as applicable however the lack of other currency borrowings does not affect the operating partnership’s ability to fully draw down under the credit facilities or term loans however the operating partnership’s lenders will not be able to terminate its credit facilities or certain term loans in the event that its credit rating falls below investment grade status none of the operating partnership’s credit facilities contain covenants regarding the parent company’s stock price or market capitalization thus a decrease in the parent company’s stock price is not expected to impact the operating partnership’s ability to borrow under its existing lines of credit while the operating partnership currently does not expect its longterm debt ratings to fall below investment grade in the event that the ratings do fall below those levels it may be unable to exercise its options to extend the term of its credit facilities and the loss of the operating partnership’s ability to borrow in foreign currencies could affect its ability to optimally hedge its borrowings against foreign currency exchange rate changes in addition based on publicly available information regarding its lenders the operating partnership currently does not expect to lose borrowing capacity under its existing lines of credit as a result of a dissolution bankruptcy consolidation merger or other business combination among its lenders the operating partnership’s access to funds under its credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to the operating partnership if the operating partnership does not have sufficient cash flows and income from its operations to meet its financial commitments and lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to the operating partnership the operating partnership’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected

its joint venture partner’s portion of debt to avoid foreclosure on the mortgaged property or permit the lender to foreclose on the mortgaged property to meet the joint venture’s debt obligations in either case the operating partnership would lose income and asset value on the property 

 

in addition a continued increase in the cost of credit and inability to access the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the occupancy of the operating partnership’s properties the disposition of its properties private capital raising and contribution of properties to its coinvestment ventures if it is unable to contribute completed development properties to its coinvestment ventures or sell its completed development projects to third parties the operating partnership will not be able to recognize gains from the contribution or sale of such properties and as a result the net income available to its common unitholders and its funds from operations will decrease additionally business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect the operating partnership’s customers may adversely impact its business and financial condition furthermore general uncertainty in the real estate markets has resulted in conditions where the pricing of certain real estate assets may be difficult due to uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and valuations among other things which may add to the difficulty of buyers or the operating partnership’s coinvestment ventures to obtain financing on favorable terms to acquire such properties or cause potential buyers to not complete acquisitions of such properties the market uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and real estate valuations also adversely impacts the operating partnership’s net asset value 

 

while the operating partnership believes that it has sufficient working capital and capacity under its credit facilities to continue its business operations as usual in the near term continued turbulence in the global markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect its liquidity and financial condition as well as the liquidity and financial condition of its customers if these market conditions persist recur or worsen in the long term they may limit the operating partnership’s ability and the ability of its customers to timely replace maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs in the event that it does not have sufficient cash available to it through its operations to continue operating its business as usual the operating partnership may need to find alternative ways to increase its liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation divesting the operating partnership of properties whether or not they otherwise meet its strategic objectives to keep in the long term at less than optimal terms issuing and selling the operating partnership’s debt and equity in public or private transactions under less than optimal conditions entering into leases with the operating partnership’s customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms entering into lease renewals with the operating partnership’s existing customers with a decrease in rental rates at turnover or on suboptimal terms or paying a portion of the parent company’s dividends in stock rather than cash there can be no assurance however that such alternative ways to increase its liquidity will be available to the operating partnership additionally taking such measures to increase its liquidity may adversely affect the operating partnership’s business results of operations and financial condition 

 

as circumstances warrant the operating partnership may issue debt securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis dependent upon market conditions and available pricing the operating partnership would use the proceeds to repay debt including borrowings under its lines of credit to make acquisitions of properties portfolios of properties or us or foreign propertyowning or real estaterelated entities or platforms to invest in newly formed or existing joint ventures or for general corporate purposes

supplemental earnings measures 

 

funds from operations “ffo” and funds from operations per share and unit “ffops” 

 

the company believes that net loss income as defined by us gaap is the most appropriate earnings measure however the company considers funds from operations or ffo and ffo per share and unit or ffops to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance the company defines ffops as ffo per fully diluted weighted average share of the parent company’s common stock and operating partnership units the company calculates ffo as net loss income available to common stockholders calculated in accordance with us gaap less gains or losses from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estaterelated depreciation and adjustments to derive the company’s pro rata share of ffo of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures 

 

the company includes the gains from development including those from valueadded conversion projects before depreciation recapture as a component of ffo the company believes gains from development should be included in ffo to more completely reflect the performance of one of its lines of business the company believes that valueadded conversion dispositions are in substance land sales and as such should be included in ffo consistent with the real estate investment trust industry’s long standing practice to include gains on the sale of land in ffo however the company’s interpretation of ffo or ffops may not be consistent with the views of others in the real estate investment trust industry who may consider it to be a divergence from the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” definition and may not be comparable to ffo or ffops reported by other real estate investment trusts that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company does in connection with the formation of a joint venture the company may warehouse assets that are acquired with the intent to contribute these assets to the newly formed venture some of the properties held for contribution may under certain circumstances be required to be depreciated under us gaap if this circumstance arises the company intends to include in its calculation of ffo gains or losses related to the contribution of previously depreciated real estate to joint ventures although such a change if instituted will be a departure from the current nareit definition the company believes such calculation of ffo will better reflect the value created as a result of the contributions to date the company has not included gains or losses from the contribution of previously depreciated warehoused assets in ffo 

 

the company believes that ffo and ffops are meaningful supplemental measures of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient thus ffo and ffops are supplemental measures of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization among other items from net loss income available to common stockholders as defined by us gaap the company believes that the use of ffo and ffops combined with the required us gaap presentations has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful the company considers ffo and ffops to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization ffo and ffops can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies while ffo and ffops are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts ffo and ffops do not represent cash flow from operations or net loss income as defined by us gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating the company’s liquidity or operating performance ffo and ffops also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the company’s real estate assets nor are ffo and ffops necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the company’s future cash requirements management compensates for the limitations of ffo and ffops by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to us gaap along with this detailed discussion of ffo and ffops and a reconciliation of ffo and ffops to net loss income available to common stockholders a us gaap measurement 

the following table reflects the calculation of ffo reconciled from net loss income available to common unitholders of the operating partnership and common stockholders of the parent company for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

 

 

 

 

  

same store net operating income “ss noi” 

 

the company defines net operating income or noi as rental revenues including reimbursements less property operating expenses noi excludes depreciation amortization general and administrative expenses restructuring charges real estate impairment losses development profits losses gains losses from sale or contribution of real estate interests and interest expense the company believes that net income as defined by gaap is the most appropriate earnings measure however noi is a useful supplemental measure calculated to help investors understand the company’s operating performance excluding the effects of costs and expenses which are not related to the performance of the assets noi is widely used by the real estate industry as a useful supplemental measure which helps investors compare the company’s operating performance with that of other companies real estate impairment losses have been excluded in deriving noi because the company does not consider its impairment losses to be a property operating expense the company believes that the exclusion of impairment losses from noi is a common methodology used in the real estate industry real estate impairment 

losses relate to the changing values of the company’s assets but do not reflect the current operating performance of the assets with respect to their revenues or expenses the company’s real estate impairment losses are noncash charges which represent the write down in the value of assets when estimated fair value over the holding period is lower than current carrying value the impairment charges were principally a result of increases in estimated capitalization rates and deterioration in market conditions that adversely impacted underlying real estate values therefore the impairment charges are not related to the current performance of the company’s real estate operations and should be excluded from its calculation of noi 

 

the company considers same store net operating income or ss noi and cashbasis ss noi to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance for properties that are considered part of the same store pool the company defines ss noi as noi on a same store basis the company defines cashbasis ss noi as ss noi excluding straightline rents and amortization of lease intangibles the same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and excludes development properties for both the current and prior reporting periods the same store pool is set annually and excludes properties purchased and developments stabilized after december 31 2007 the company considers cashbasis ss noi to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure because it reflects the operating performance of the real estate portfolio excluding effects of noncash adjustments and provides a better measure of actual cashbasis rental growth for a yearoveryear comparison in addition the company believes that ss noi and cashbasis ss noi help investors compare the operating performance of its real estate as compared to other companies while ss noi and cashbasis ssnoi are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts they do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating the company’s liquidity or operating performance ss noi and cashbasis ss noi also do not reflect general and administrative expenses interest expenses real estate impairment losses depreciation and amortization costs capital expenditures and leasing costs or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact the company’s results from operations further the company’s computation of ss noi and cashbasis ss noi may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating ss noi and cashbasis ss noi 

 

the following table reconciles ss noi cashbasis ss noi and cashbasis ss noi excluding lease termination fees from net loss income for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 dollars in thousands

 item 1 business 

 

prologis is a leading global provider of industrial distribution facilities we are a maryland real estate investment trust “reit” and have elected to be taxed as such under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” our world headquarters is located in denver colorado our european headquarters is located in the grand duchy of luxembourg with our european customer service headquarters located in amsterdam the netherlands our primary office in asia is located in tokyo japan 

 

our internet website address is wwwprologiscom all reports required to be filed with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” are available or may be accessed free of charge through the investor relations section of our internet website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the sec our internet website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this annual report on form 10k our common shares trade under the ticker symbol “pld” on the new york stock exchange 

 

we were formed in 1991 primarily as a longterm owner of industrial distribution space operating in the united states over time our business strategy evolved to include the development of properties for contribution to property funds in which we maintain an ownership interest and the management of those property funds and the properties they own originally we sought to differentiate ourselves from our competition by focusing on our corporate customers’ distribution space requirements on a national regional and local basis and providing customers with consistent levels of service throughout the united states however as our customers’ needs expanded to markets outside the united states so did our portfolio and our management team today we are an international real estate company with operations in north america europe and asia our business strategy is to integrate international scope and expertise with a strong local presence in our markets thereby becoming an attractive choice for our targeted customer base the largest global users of distribution space while achieving longterm sustainable growth in cash flow 

 

industrial distribution facilities are a crucial link in the modern supply chain and they serve three primary purposes for supplychain participants i ensure accurate and seamless flow of goods to their appointed destinations ii function as processing centers for goods and iii enable companies to store enough inventory to meet surges in demand and to cushion themselves from the impact of a break in the supply chain 

 

at december 31 2008 our total portfolio of properties owned managed and under development including directowned properties and properties owned by property funds and joint ventures that we manage and 

excluding properties held for sale consisted of the following properties in north america europe and asia broken down as follows 

 

 

 

business strategy 

 

recently the global financial markets have been undergoing pervasive and fundamental disruptions which began to impact us late in the third quarter of 2008 as the global credit crisis worsened in the fourth quarter it was necessary for us to modify our business strategy as such we discontinued most of our new development and acquisition activities in order to focus on our core business of owning and managing industrial properties narrowing our focus has allowed us to take the necessary steps toward reducing our debt and maximizing liquidity and cash flow we believe our current business strategy coupled with the following objectives for both the near and longterm will position us to take advantage of business opportunities upon the stabilization of the global financial markets 

 

nearterm objectives 

 

  

longerterm objectives 

 

 4 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we took the following steps that we believe will position us to accomplish the objectives identified above 

 

  

our operating segments 

 

the following discussion of our business segments should be read in conjunction with “item 1a risk factors” our property information presented in “item 2 properties” “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 19 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

our business was previously organized into three reportable business segments i direct owned previously called property operations ii investment management and iii development or cdfs business due to recent economic conditions we have modified our business strategy and as a result we will no longer perform the investment and development activities within our cdfs business segment as a result we transferred all of our real estate and other assets that were in our development pipeline to our direct owned segment and we transferred our investments in industrial and retail joint ventures to our investment management segment the discussion that follows discusses the segments as they were through 2008 as well as what we expect them to be on a prospective basis our china operations which were sold in february 2009 are presented as held for sale at december 31 2008 and not included in the discussion that follows 

 

operating segments – direct owned 

 

our direct owned segment represents the longterm ownership of industrial properties our investment strategy in this segment focuses primarily on the ownership and leasing of industrial and retail properties in key distribution markets we consider these properties to be our core properties also included in this segment are real estate properties that were previously acquired or developed within our cdfs business segment and that because changes in our business strategy were transferred to this segment due to our current intent to hold and operate these assets on a longterm basis these include operating properties that we previously developed with the intent to contribute to an unconsolidated property fund we now refer to these properties as completed development properties we also have industrial properties that are currently under development and land available for development that are part of this segment the majority of which we plan to hold and use in this segment 

investments 

 

at december 31 2008 the following properties are in the direct owned segment square feet and investment in thousands 

 

 

 

these properties are located in north america europe and asia 

 

in the near term we may occasionally acquire a property for this segment generally to satisfy certain tax requirements that may arise due to the previous sale of a property 

 

results of operations 

 

we earn rent from our customers including reimbursement of certain operating costs under longterm operating leases with an average lease term of six to seven years at december 31 2008 the revenue in this segment decreased in 2008 primarily due to the contribution of properties to property funds offset partially by increases in occupancy levels within our development properties however due to current market challenges leasing activity has slowed and rental revenues generated by the leaseup of newly developed properties have not been adequate to completely offset the loss of rental revenues from property contributions we expect our total revenues from this segment will decrease in 2009 due to the contributions and dispositions of properties we made in 2008 and may make in 2009 we intend to grow our revenue in the remaining properties primarily through increases in occupied square feet in our completed development properties and properties currently under development the costs of our property management function for both our directowned portfolio and the properties owned by the property funds and managed by us are reported in rental expenses in the direct owned segment as the portfolio of properties we manage has continued to grow the related property management expenses have increased causing a decrease in margins and profitability in this segment offset by increases in the investment management segment 

 

market presence 

 

at december 31 2008 our 1331 operating properties in this segment aggregating 1971 million square feet were located in 40 markets in north america 33 markets in the united states 6 markets in mexico and 1 market in canada 29 markets in europe belgium the czech republic france germany hungary italy the netherlands poland romania slovakia spain sweden and the united kingdom and 6 markets in asia japan and south korea our largest markets for this segment in north america based on our investment in the properties are atlanta chicago dallasfort worth inland empire los angeles new jersey and san francisco east bay our largest investment in europe is in the united kingdom and our largest investment in asia is in japan our 65 properties under development at december 31 2008 aggregated 198 million square feet and were located in 8 markets in north america 23 markets in europe and 3 markets in asia at december 31 2008 we owned 10134 acres of land with an investment of 25 billion and located in north america 6400 acres 11 billion investment europe 3614 acres 11 billion investment and asia 120 acres 03 billion investment see further detail in “item 2 properties” 

 

competition 

 

the existence of competitively priced distribution space available in any market could have a material impact on our ability to rent space and on the rents that we can charge to the extent we wish to acquire land for future development of properties in our direct owned segment we may compete with local regional and 

national developers we also face competition from other investment managers in attracting capital for our property funds to be utilized to acquire properties from us or third parties 

 

we believe we have competitive advantages due to i our ability to quickly respond to customer’s needs for highquality distribution space in key global distribution markets ii our established relationships with key customers serviced by our local personnel iii our ability to leverage our organizational structure to provide a single point of contact for our global customers iv our property management and leasing expertise v our relationships and proven track record with current and prospective investors in the property funds vi our global experience in the development and management of industrial properties vii the strategic locations of our land positions and viii our personnel who are experienced in the land acquisition and entitlement process 

 

property management 

 

our business strategy includes a customer service focus that enables us to provide responsive professional and effective property management services at the local level to enhance our management services we have developed and implemented proprietary operating and training systems to achieve consistent levels of performance and professionalism and to enable our property management team to give the proper level of attention to our customers we manage substantially all of our operating properties 

 

customers 

 

we have developed a customer base that is diverse in terms of industry concentration and represents a broad spectrum of international national regional and local distribution space users at december 31 2008 in our direct owned segment we had 2815 customers occupying 1573 million square feet of industrial and retail space our largest customer and 25 largest customers accounted for 19 and 118 respectively of our annualized collected base rents at december 31 2008 

 

employees 

 

we employ 1480 persons in our entire business our employees work in three countries in north america 840 persons in 13 countries in europe 490 persons and in 2 countries in asia 150 persons of the total we have assigned 890 employees to our direct owned segment and 80 employees to our investment management segment we have 510 employees who work in corporate positions who are not assigned to a segment who may assist with segment activities we believe our relationships with our employees are good our employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements although some of our employees in europe are represented by statutory works councils and benefit from applicable labor agreements our china operations are held for sale as of december 31 2008 and the 240 employees in china are not included in the information above 

 

future plans 

 

our current business plan allows for the limited expansion of operating properties as necessary to i address the specific expansion needs of customers ii enhance our market presence in a specific country market or submarket iii take advantage of opportunities where we believe we have the ability to achieve favorable returns and iv monetize our existing land positions through precommitted development of industrial properties to hold and use in this segment in addition we expect to complete the development and leasing of our properties under development as of december 31 2008 we had 65 properties under development with a current investment of 12 billion and a total expected investment when completed and leased of 19 billion these properties were 372 leased at december 31 2008 

 

in 2009 we intend to fund our investment activities in the direct owned segment depending on market conditions and other factors primarily with operating cash flow from this segment borrowings under existing credit facilities equity issuances and proceeds from contributions and dispositions of properties in the future depending on market conditions and the capital available from our fund partners we may contribute core properties andor completed development properties to the property funds or sell to a third party 

operating segments – investment management 

 

the investment management segment represents the investment management of unconsolidated property funds and certain joint ventures and the properties they own we utilize our investment management expertise to manage the property funds and certain joint ventures and we utilize our leasing and property management expertise to manage the properties owned by these entities we report the property management costs for both our direct owned segment and the properties owned by the property funds in rental expenses in the direct owned segment and we include the fund management costs in general and administrative expenses 

 

our property fund strategy 

 

  

historically our property fund strategy has also 

 

  

although we may continue to make contributions of properties to the property funds due to the current market conditions including increasing capitalization rates we do not expect to recognize gains at the level we have in the past see further discussion in “operating segments – cdfs business” below 

 

investments 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had investments in and advances to 17 property funds totaling 20 billion with ownership interests ranging from 20 to 50 these investments are in north america — 12 aggregating 9417 million europe — 2 aggregating 6346 million and asia — 3 aggregating 3817 million these property funds own on a combined basis 1336 distribution properties aggregating 2969 million square feet with a total entity investment not our proportionate share in operating properties of 247 billion also included in this segment are certain industrial and retail joint ventures which we manage and that own 3 operating properties with 07 million square feet located in north america and europe 

 

in december we entered into a binding agreement to sell our 20 equity investments in our property funds in japan to our fund partner our investments in the japan property funds aggregated 3598 million these property funds owned 70 properties totaling 270 million square feet in this same agreement we agreed to sell our china operations which include our investments in a property fund and joint ventures which are classified as held for sale as of december 31 2008 and are not included above 

 

results of operations 

 

we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings or losses from our investments in unconsolidated property funds and certain joint ventures in addition to the income recognized under the equity method we recognize fees and incentives earned for services performed on behalf of these entities and interest earned on advances to these entities if any we provide services to these entities such as property management asset management acquisition financing and development we may also earn incentives from our property funds depending on the return provided to the fund partners over a specified period we expect any future growth in income recognized to result from growth in existing property funds primarily from properties the funds 

acquired from us in 2008 and may acquire from us or third parties in the future as well as the formation of future funds 

 

market presence 

 

at december 31 2008 the property funds on a combined basis owned 1336 properties aggregating 2969 million square feet located in 44 markets in north america canada mexico and the united states 35 markets in europe belgium the czech republic france germany hungary italy the netherlands poland slovakia spain sweden and the united kingdom and 10 markets in asia japan and south korea the industrial and retail joint ventures included in this segment are located in the united states and the united kingdom and operate 3 industrial properties with 07 million square feet 

 

competition 

 

as the manager of the property funds we compete with other fund managers for institutional capital as the manager of the properties owned by the property funds we compete with other industrial properties located in close proximity to the properties owned by the property funds the amount of rentable distribution space available and its current occupancy in any market could have a material effect on the ability to rent space and on the rents that can be charged by the fund properties we believe we have competitive advantages as discussed above in “operating segments — direct owned” 

 

property management 

 

we manage the properties owned by unconsolidated investees utilizing our leasing and property management experience from the employees who are in our direct owned segment our business strategy includes a customer service focus that enables us to provide responsive professional and effective property management services at the local level to enhance our management services we have developed and implemented proprietary operating and training systems to achieve consistent levels of performance and professionalism and to enable our property management team to give the proper level of attention to our customers 

 

customers 

 

as in our direct owned segment we have developed a customer base in the property funds and joint ventures that is diverse in terms of industry concentration and represents a broad spectrum of international national regional and local distribution space users at december 31 2008 our unconsolidated investees on a combined basis had 2052 customers occupying 2846 million square feet of distribution space the largest customer and 25 largest customers of our unconsolidated investees on a combined basis accounted for 38 and 293 respectively of the total combined annualized collected base rents at december 31 2008 in addition in this segment we consider our fund partners to also be our customers as of december 31 2008 we partnered with 41 institutional investors several of which invest in multiple funds 

 

employees 

 

the property funds generally have no employees of their own employees in our direct owned segment are responsible for the management of the properties owned by the property funds we have assigned 80 additional employees directly to the management of the property funds in our investment management segment we have 510 employees who work in corporate positions and are not assigned to a segment who may assist with these activities as well 

 

future plans 

 

we expect to continue to increase our investments in property funds although at a slower pace than in the past we expect to achieve these increases through the existing property funds’ acquisition of properties from us as well as from third parties we expect the fee income we earn from the property funds and our proportionate share of net earnings of the property funds will increase as the size and value of the portfolios 

owned by the property funds grows and as more equity is deployed in the funds we will continue to explore our options related to both new and existing property funds 

 

operating segments – cdfs business 

 

given the challenges that we are facing in this current economic environment and the corresponding changes we have made to our business strategy we do not expect to have a cdfs business segment in 2009 as of december 31 2008 all of the assets and liabilities that were in this segment have been transferred to our two remaining segments we transferred all of our real estate and other assets that were in our development pipeline to our direct owned segment our investments in certain joint ventures were transferred to our investment management segment as noted above we may contribute completed development properties andor core properties to the property funds or sell to third parties although these will no longer be reported in our cdfs business segment through the end of 2008 this segment primarily included the contribution of industrial properties we had developed or acquired with the intent to contribute to a property fund in which we had an ownership interest and acted as manager at december 31 2008 we had no investments remaining in this segment

 these individuals are our executive officers under item 401 of regulation sk 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our operating results and financial condition a majority of the properties we have acquired were subjected to environmental reviews by either us or the previous owners while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 and item 1a risk factors 

 

insurance coverage 

 

we carry insurance coverage on our properties we determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and other 

of our business operations in specific markets such coverage includes property liability fire named windstorm flood earthquake environmental terrorism extended coverage and rental loss we believe that our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured however an uninsured loss could result in loss of capital investment and anticipated profits 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of our common shares these risks include among others 

 

current events 

 

the recent market disruptions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

the global financial markets have been undergoing pervasive and fundamental disruptions the continuation or intensification of such volatility may lead to additional adverse impact on the general availability of credit to businesses and could lead to a further weakening of the us and global economies to the extent that turmoil in the financial markets continues andor intensifies it has the potential to materially affect the value of our properties and our investments in our unconsolidated investees the availability or the terms of financing that we and our unconsolidated investees have or may anticipate utilizing our ability and that of our unconsolidated investees to make principal and interest payments on or refinance any outstanding debt when due andor may impact the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases the current market disruption could also affect our operating results and financial condition as follows 

 

 13 

 

  

general real estate risks 

 

general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results 

 

we are exposed to the general economic conditions the local regional national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties approximately 243 of our direct owned operating properties based on our investment before depreciation are located in california properties in california may be more susceptible to certain types of natural disasters such as earthquakes brush fires flooding and mudslides than properties located in other markets and a major natural disaster in california could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we also have significant holdings defined as more than 30 of our total investment before depreciation in direct owned operating properties in certain markets located in atlanta chicago dallasfort worth new jersey japan and the united kingdom our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties conditions such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space among other factors may impact operating conditions any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction in demand for distribution space could adversely affect our results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of our securities in addition the property funds and joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest have concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above as well as pennsylvania reno france and poland and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets 

 

real property investments are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business 

 

real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio market research and our property management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated some of the factors that may affect real estate values include 

 

 14 

 

our investments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector or an unanticipated change in the supply chain dynamics 

 

our investments in real estate assets are primarily concentrated in the industrial distribution sector this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified 

 

our real estate development strategies may not be successful 

 

we have developed a significant number of industrial properties since our inception in late 2008 we scaled back our development activities in response to current economic conditions although we do expect to pursue development activities in the future our near term strategy is to complete and lease the buildings currently in development and lease the properties we have recently completed as of december 31 2008 we had 140 completed development properties that were 435 leased 230 million square feet of unleased space and we had 65 industrial properties that were under development that were 372 leased 125 million square feet of unleased space as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 8854 million of costs remaining to be spent related to our development portfolio to complete the development and lease the space in these properties 

 

additionally as of december 31 2008 we had 10134 acres of land with a current investment of 25 billion for potential future development of industrial properties or other commercial real estate projects or for sale to third parties within our land positions we have concentrations in many of the same markets as our operating properties approximately 168 of our land based on the current investment balance is in the united kingdom during 2008 we recorded impairment charges of 1942 million predominantly in the united kingdom due to the decrease in current estimated fair value of the land and increased probability that we will dispose of certain land parcels rather than develop as previously planned we will look to monetize the land in the future through sale to third parties development of industrial properties to own and use or sale to an unconsolidated investee for development depending on market conditions and other factors 

 

we will be subject to risks associated with such development and disposition activities all of which may adversely affect our results of operations and available cash flow including but not limited to 

 

 15 

 

our business strategy to provide liquidity to reduce debt by contributing properties to property funds or disposing of properties to third parties may not be successful 

 

our ability to contribute or sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties current market conditions including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties and other factors beyond our control the property funds or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital in the private and public markets in order to acquire properties from us should the property funds or third parties have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then contributions and distributions could be delayed resulting in adverse effects on our liquidity results of operations distributable cash flow debt covenant ratios and on the value of our securities 

 

we may acquire properties which involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results and the value of our securities 

 

we may acquire industrial properties in our direct owned segment the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates there is and it is expected there will continue to be significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities 

 

our operating results and distributable cash flow will depend on the continued generation of lease revenues from customers 

 

our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations we are also subject to the risk that upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties leases may not be renewed by existing customers the space may not be released to new customers or the terms of renewal or releasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms in the event of default by a significant number of customers we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord a customer may experience a downturn in its business which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease in addition a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow 

 

our ability to renew leases or release space on favorable terms as leases expire significantly affects our business 

 

our results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of our securities would be adversely affected if we were unable to lease on economically favorable terms a significant amount of space in our operating properties we have 302 million square feet of industrial and retail space out of a total of 1573 million occupied square feet representing 167 of total annual base rents with leases that expire in 2009 including 39 million square feet of leases that are on a monthtomonth basis in addition our unconsolidated investees have a combined 365 million square feet of industrial space out of a total 2846 million occupied square feet representing 101 of total annual base rent with leases that expire in 2009 including 66 million square feet of leases that are on a monthtomonth basis the number of industrial and retail properties in a market or submarket could adversely affect both our ability to release the space and the rental rates that can be obtained in new leases 

real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of assets which may reduce economic returns to investors 

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions in addition significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments like other companies qualifying as reits under the code we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable reit subsidiaries in order to avoid punitive taxation on the gain from the sale of such property while we are planning to dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment in order to generate liquidity if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or if we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on the gain from the sale we may not pursue such sales 

 

our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses 

 

we and our unconsolidated investees currently carry insurance coverage including property liability fire named windstorm flood earthquake environmental terrorism extended coverage and rental loss as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets we believe our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated investees including the property funds are adequately insured however there are certain losses including losses from floods earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property 

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances 

 

a majority of the properties we acquire are subjected to environmental reviews either by us or by the predecessor owners in addition we may incur environmental remediation costs associated with certain land parcels we acquire in connection with the development of the land in connection with the merger in 2005 with catellus development corporation “catellus” we acquired certain properties in urban and industrial areas that may have been leased to or previously owned by commercial and industrial companies that discharged hazardous materials we establish a liability at the time of acquisition to cover such costs we adjust the liabilities as appropriate when additional information becomes available we purchase various environmental insurance policies to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the presence of such substances on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow 

risks related to financing and capital 

 

our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to make required payments on our debt or are unable to refinance our debt 

 

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected and if the maturing debt is secured the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness our unsecured credit facilities and certain other unsecured debt bear interest at variable rates increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements in addition our unconsolidated investees have shortterm debt that was used to acquire properties from us or third parties and other maturing indebtedness if these investees are unable to refinance their indebtedness or meet their payment obligations it may impact our distributable cash flow and our financial condition 

 

covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition 

 

the terms of our various credit agreements including our credit facilities and the indenture under which our senior and other notes are issued require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage leverage ratios fixed charge ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness if we default under our covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default refinance our indebtedness or meet our payment obligations the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected 

 

federal income tax risks 

 

failure to qualify as a reit could adversely affect our cash flows 

 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1993 in addition we have a consolidated subsidiary that has elected to be taxed as a reit and certain unconsolidated investees that are reits and are subject to all the risks pertaining to the reit structure discussed herein to maintain reit status we must meet a number of highly technical requirements on a continuing basis those requirements seek to ensure among other things that the gross income and investments of a reit are largely real estate related that a reit distributes substantially all of its ordinary taxable income to shareholders on a current basis and that the reit’s equity ownership is not overly concentrated due to the complex nature of these rules the available guidance concerning interpretation of the rules the importance of ongoing factual determinations and the possibility of adverse changes in the law administrative interpretations of the law and changes in our business no assurance can be given that we or our reit subsidiaries will qualify as a reit for any particular period 

 

if we fail to qualify as a reit we will be taxed as a regular corporation and distributions to shareholders will not be deductible in computing our taxable income the resulting corporate income tax liabilities could materially reduce our cash flow and funds available for reinvestment moreover we might not be able to elect to be treated as a reit for the four taxable years after the year during which we ceased to qualify as a reit in addition if we later requalified as a reit we might be required to pay a full corporatelevel tax on any unrealized gains in our assets as of the date of requalification or upon subsequent disposition and to make distributions to our shareholders equal to any earnings accumulated during the period of nonreit status 

reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our financial condition 

 

to maintain qualification as a reit under the code generally a reit must annually distribute to its shareholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains this requirement limits our ability to accumulate capital and therefore we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements difficulties in meeting the distribution requirements might arise due to competing demands for our funds or to timing differences between tax reporting and cash receipts and disbursements because income may have to be reported before cash is received or because expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed in addition the internal revenue service the “irs” may make a determination in connection with the settlement of an audit by the irs that increases taxable income or disallows or limits deductions taken thereby increasing the distribution we are required to make in those situations we might be required to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements and interest and penalties could apply which could adversely affect our financial condition if we fail to make a required distribution we would cease to qualify as a reit 

 

prohibited transaction income could result from certain property transfers 

 

we contribute properties to property funds and sell properties to third parties from the reit and from taxable reit subsidiaries “trs” under the code a disposition of a property from other than a trs could be deemed a prohibited transaction in such case a 100 penalty tax on the resulting gain could be assessed the determination that a transaction constitutes a prohibited transaction is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction the irs could contend that certain contributions or sales of properties by us are prohibited transactions while we do not believe the irs would prevail in such a dispute if the irs successfully argued the matter the 100 penalty tax could be assessed against the gains from these transactions which may be significant additionally any gain from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 

 

liabilities recorded for preexisting tax audits may not be sufficient 

 

we are subject to pending audits by the irs and the california franchise tax board of the 1999 through 2005 income tax returns of catellus including certain of its subsidiaries and partnerships we have recorded an accrual for the liabilities that may arise from these audits during 2008 we agreed to enter into a closing agreement with the irs for the settlement of the 19992002 audits and we increased the recorded liability by 854 million for all audits accordingly see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 the finalization of the remaining audits may result in an adjustment in which the actual liabilities or settlement costs including interest and potential penalties if any may prove to be more than the liability we have recorded 

 

uncertainties relating to catellus’ estimate of its “earnings and profits” attributable to ccorporation taxable years may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow 

 

in order to qualify as a reit a reit cannot have at the end of any reit taxable year any undistributed earnings and profits that are attributable to a ccorporation taxable year a reit has until the close of its first full taxable year as a reit in which it has nonreit earnings and profits to distribute these accumulated earnings and profits because catellus’ first full taxable year as a reit was 2004 catellus was required to distribute these earnings and profits prior to the end of 2004 failure to meet this requirement would result in catellus’ disqualification as a reit catellus distributed its accumulated nonreit earnings and profits in december 2003 well in advance of the 2004 yearend deadline and believed that this distribution was sufficient to distribute all of its nonreit earnings and profits however the determination of nonreit earnings and profits is complicated and depends upon facts with respect to which catellus may have less than complete information or the application of the law governing earnings and profits which is subject to differing interpretations or both consequently there are substantial uncertainties relating to the estimate of catellus’ nonreit earnings and profits and we cannot be assured that the earnings and profits distribution requirement has been met these uncertainties include the possibility that the irs could upon audit as discussed above 

increase the taxable income of catellus which would increase the nonreit earnings and profits of catellus there can be no assurances that we have satisfied the requirement that catellus distribute all of its nonreit earnings and profits by the close of its first taxable year as a reit and therefore this may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow 

 

there are potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities that could affect our operating results or financial condition 

 

palmtree acquisition corporation our subsidiary that was the surviving corporation in the merger with catellus in 2005 is subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate currently 35 and potential state taxes on any gain recognized within ten years of catellus’ conversion to a reit from a disposition of any assets that catellus held at the effective time of its election to be a reit but only to the extent of the builtingain based on the fair market value of those assets on the effective date of the reit election which was january 1 2004 gain from a sale of an asset occurring more than 10 years after the reit conversion will not be subject to this corporatelevel tax we do not currently expect to dispose of any asset of the surviving corporation in the merger if such disposition would result in the imposition of a material tax liability unless we can affect a taxdeferred exchange of the property however certain assets are subject to third party purchase options that may require us to sell such assets and those assets may carry deferred tax liabilities that would be triggered on such sales we have recorded deferred tax liabilities related to these builtingains there can be no assurances that our plans in this regard will not change and if such plans do change or if a purchase option is exercised that we will be successful in structuring a taxdeferred exchange 

 

other risks 

 

we are dependent on key personnel 

 

our executive and other senior officers have a significant role in our success our ability to retain our management group or to attract suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market the loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their availability could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow further such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets 

 

share prices may be affected by market interest rates 

 

in response to current economic conditions we reduced the expected annual distribution rate for 2009 to 100 per common share the annual distribution rate on common shares as a percentage of our market price may influence the trading price of such common shares an increase in market interest rates may lead investors to demand a higher annual distribution rate than we have set which could adversely affect the value of our common shares 

 

as a global company we are subject to social political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states during 2008 we generated approximately 70 of our revenue from operations outside the united states primarily due to proceeds from contributions of properties to property funds in europe and japan circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

 

 20 

 

  

although we have committed substantial resources to expand our global development platform if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

 

in addition our international operations and specifically the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt may be affected by currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other things 

 

the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

 

we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the national currency at december 31 2008 approximately 47 of our total assets excluding our china operations which were sold in february 2009 and presented as assets held for sale are invested in a currency other than the us dollar primarily the euro japanese yen and british pound sterling as a result we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and on occasion and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative contracts there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful 

 

we are subject to governmental regulations and actions that affect operating results and financial condition 

 

many laws and governmental regulations apply to us our unconsolidated investees and our properties changes in these laws and governmental regulations or their interpretation by agencies or the courts could occur which might affect our ability to conduct business

distributions and dividends 

 

in order to comply with the reit requirements of the code we are generally required to make common share distributions and preferred share dividends other than capital gain distributions to our shareholders in amounts that together at least equal i the sum of a 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains and b 90 of the net income after tax if any from foreclosure property minus ii certain excess noncash income our common share distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow that ensures that we will meet the distribution requirements of the 

code and that allows us to maximize the cash retained to meet other cash needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities 

 

the annual distribution rate for 2008 was 207 per common share in november 2008 the board set the expected annual distribution rate for 2009 at 100 per common share subject to market conditions and reit distribution requirements the payment of common share distributions as well as whether the distribution will be payable in cash or shares of beneficial interest or some combination is dependent upon our financial condition and operating results and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year 

 

in addition to common shares we have issued cumulative redeemable preferred shares of beneficial interest at december 31 2008 we had three series of preferred shares outstanding “series c preferred shares” “series f preferred shares” and “series g preferred shares” holders of each series of preferred shares outstanding have limited voting rights subject to certain conditions and are entitled to receive cumulative preferential dividends based upon each series’ respective liquidation preference such dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of march june september and december dividends on preferred shares are payable when and if they have been declared by the board out of funds legally available for payment of dividends after the respective redemption dates each series of preferred shares can be redeemed at our option the cash redemption price other than the portion consisting of accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to series c preferred shares is payable solely out of the cumulative sales proceeds of other capital shares of ours which may include shares of other series of preferred shares with respect to the payment of dividends each series of preferred shares ranks on parity with our other series of preferred shares annual per share dividends paid on each series of preferred shares were as follows for the periods indicated

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report and the matters described under “item 1a risk factors” 

 

management’s overview 

 

we are a selfadministered and selfmanaged reit that owns operates and develops real estate properties primarily industrial properties in north america europe and asia directly and through our unconsolidated investees our business is primarily driven by requirements for modern welllocated inventory space in key global distribution locations our focus on our customers’ needs has enabled us to become a leading global provider of industrial distribution properties 

 

recently the global financial markets have been undergoing pervasive and fundamental disruptions which began to impact us late in the third quarter of 2008 as the global credit crisis worsened in the fourth quarter it was necessary for us to modify our business strategy as such we discontinued most of our new development and acquisition activities in order to focus on our core business of owning and managing industrial properties narrowing our focus has allowed us to take the necessary steps toward reducing our debt and maximizing liquidity and cash flow we believe our current business strategy coupled with the following objectives for both the near and longterm will position us to take advantage of business opportunities upon the stabilization of the global financial markets 

 

nearterm objectives 

 

  

longerterm objectives 

 

  

due to recent economic conditions we have changed our nearterm business strategy which will no longer focus on cdfs business activities as a result as of december 31 2008 we have two operating segments i direct owned and ii investment management our direct owned segment represents the direct longterm ownership of industrial and retail properties our investment management segment represents the longterm investment management of property funds and the properties they own our development or cdfs business segment which had results through december 31 2008 primarily encompassed our development or acquisition of real estate properties that were subsequently contributed to a property fund in which we have an ownership interest and act as manager or sold to third parties as of december 31 2008 all of the assets and liabilities in this segment have been transferred into our two remaining segments 

we generate and seek to increase revenues earnings ffo as defined at the end of item 7 and cash flows through our segments primarily as follows 

 

  

key items in 2008 

 

 32 

 

  

  

  

summary of 2008 

 

our direct owned portfolio decreased in 2008 on average due to the contributions of properties to the property funds net operating income from our direct owned segment decreased to 6417 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 7396 million for the same period in 2007 the decrease was largely due to us owning a smaller operating portfolio on average during 2008 over the same period in 2007 an increase in property management expenses insurance and other rental expenses not recoverable from our customers offset partially by an increase in occupancy levels and rental rate increases rental expenses in this segment include the property management costs we incur to manage our properties and the properties owned by the property funds for which we receive management fee income the property management costs increased 105 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the growth in the portfolios we manage on behalf of the property funds nonrecoverable rental expenses increased due to a 60 million increase in insurance expense related to a tornado in the first quarter of 2008 

 

we had net operating income from the investment management segment of 664 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 1960 million for 2007 in 2008 we recognized a loss of 1082 million 

representing our share of the loss recognized by prologis european properties “pepr” upon the sale and impairment of its ownership interests in prologis european properties fund ii “pepf ii” we also recognized our share of realized and unrealized losses of 323 million related to interest rate derivative contracts held by certain property funds in 2007 we recognized 382 million that represented our proportionate share of a gain recognized by pepr from the sale of certain properties without these items in both 2008 and 2007 net operating income from this segment increased 491 million or 31 due to the increased size of the portfolios owned by the property funds 

 

net operating income of the cdfs business segment decreased for the year ended december 31 2008 to 6579 million from 7862 million for the same period in 2007 primarily due to decreased levels of contributions and lower profit margins in 2007 we repositioned a property fund and recognized gains of 686 million in this segment 

 

results of operations 

 

information for the years ended december 31 regarding net earnings loss attributable to common shares was as follows 

 

 

 

the decrease in net earnings in 2008 from 2007 is primarily due to impairment charges recognized in 2008 of 9018 million charges of 264 million related to our rif plan lower gains on dispositions of properties lower rental income and higher rental expenses offset by a 907 million gain on the extinguishment of debt the impairment charges related to our real estate properties goodwill china operations unconsolidated investees and other assets and are discussed in more detail in notes 5 7 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 in 2007 we recognized gains on dispositions of both cdfs and noncdfs properties of 9919 million as compared with 6901 million of gains in 2008 net earnings in 2007 included i the repositioning of a property fund resulting in total gains from cdfs contributions and foreign exchange contracts of 952 million ii the disposition of 77 properties from our direct owned segment to two of the unconsolidated property funds which generated gains of 1467 million and iii the recognition of our share of net gains of 382 million from the property funds due to the disposition of properties in 2007 these transactions have also resulted in less rental income in 2008 compared with 2007 the increase in net earnings attributable to common shares in 2007 over 2006 was due to increased gains on contributions of cdfs and noncdfs properties to property funds outlined above higher gains on sales of land and improved property operating performance partially offset by lower incentive fees from property funds and lower gains on sales of properties to third parties 

 

direct owned segment 

 

the net operating income of the direct owned segment consists of rental income and rental expenses from industrial and retail properties during the time we directly own it the rental income and expenses of operating properties that were developed or acquired with the intent to contribute to a property fund are included in this segment prior to contribution when a property is contributed to a property fund we begin reporting our share of the earnings of the property under the equity method in the investment management segment however the overhead costs incurred by us to provide the management services to the property fund continue to be reported as part of rental expenses in this segment the size and leased percentage of our direct owned operating portfolio fluctuates due to the timing of contributions and dispositions of properties and the acquisition and development of properties and impacts the net operating income we recognize in this segment see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a reconciliation of net operating income to earnings loss 

before minority interest the net operating income from the direct owned segment excluding amounts presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements was as follows in thousands 

 

 

 

we had a direct owned operating portfolio at december 31 2008 and 2007 as follows square feet in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

the decrease in rental income in 2008 from 2007 is due primarily to the contributions of properties to the unconsolidated property funds offset partially by increases in rental rates on turnovers new leasing activity in our development properties and increases in rental recoveries under the terms of our lease agreements we are able to recover the majority of our rental expenses from customers rental expense recoveries included in both rental income and expenses were 2263 million 2094 million and 1745 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increases in rental expense recoveries were driven by increased property taxes and common area maintenance expenses such as utilities and snow removal costs in addition to the increased recoverable expenses property management costs and certain nonrecoverable costs have increased as well offset somewhat by a decrease in expenses due to the contribution or disposition of the properties the increase in property management costs in 2008 over 2007 of 105 million is due largely to the increase in the number of properties we manage on behalf of the property funds the increase in nonrecoverable costs included a 60 million insurance adjustment made during the first quarter of 2008 due to a tornado that struck certain properties owned by us and owned by the property funds and insured by us through our insurance company 

 

the increases in rental income and rental expenses in 2007 over 2006 are due to us owning more properties in 2007 than 2006 as a result of the timing of contributions as well as increases in the net operating income of the same store properties we own directly during the third quarter of 2007 we acquired all of the units in mpr an australian listed property trust that had an 89 ownership interest in prologis north american properties fund v this transaction resulted in us owning 100 of the assets for approximately two months when the lender converted certain of the bridge debt into equity of a new property fund prologis north american industrial fund ii in which we have a 369 equity interest collectively the “mpr transaction” as we held these properties directly and consolidated their operating results for a short time in 2007 we had net operating income associated with these properties of approximately 17 million in 2007 during the 

remainder of 2007 and all of 2008 we recognized our proportionate share of the results of these properties through our earnings loss from unconsolidated property funds 

 

investment management segment 

 

the net operating income of the investment management segment consists of i earnings or losses recognized under the equity method from our investments in property funds and certain joint ventures that develop or own industrial or retail properties ii fees and incentives earned for services performed and iii interest earned on advances the net earnings or losses of the unconsolidated investees may include the following income and expense items of our unconsolidated investees in addition to rental income and rental expenses i interest income and interest expense ii depreciation and amortization expenses iii general and administrative expenses iv income tax expense v foreign currency exchange gains and losses vi gains or losses on dispositions of properties or investments and vii impairment charges the fluctuations in income we recognize in any given period are generally the result of i variances in the income and expense items of the unconsolidated investees ii the size of the portfolio and occupancy levels in each period iii changes in our ownership interest and iv fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates at which we translate our share of net earnings to us dollars if applicable the costs of the property management function performed by us for the properties owned by the property funds and joint ventures are reported in the direct owned segment and the costs of the investment management function are included in our general and administrative expenses see notes 5 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on our unconsolidated investees and for a reconciliation of net operating income to earnings loss before minority interest 

 

the net operating income from the investment management segment was as follows for the periods indicated in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 36 

  

cdfs business segment 

 

net operating income from the cdfs business segment consists primarily of i gains resulting from the contributions and dispositions of properties generally developed by us or acquired with the intent to contribute to an existing or new property fund ii gains from the dispositions of land parcels including land subject to ground leases and properties to third parties iii fees earned for development services provided to customers and third parties and iv certain costs associated with the potential acquisition of cdfs business assets and land holding costs we recognize a gain based on the increased fair value of the property at the time of contribution as supported by third party appraisals to the extent of third party ownership interest in the property fund or unconsolidated investee acquiring the property see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a reconciliation of net operating income to earnings loss before minority interest 

 

for 2008 our net operating income in this segment excluding amounts presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements was 6579 million as compared to 7862 million in 2007 a decrease of 1283 million the decrease was due to a lower level of contributions in 2008 a decrease in our net profit margins on developed and repositioned properties and lower gains on sales of land in 2008 186 of the net operating income of this operating segment was generated in north america 473 was generated in europe and 341 was generated in asia 

 

for 2007 our net operating income in this segment excluding amounts presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements was 7862 million as compared to 3345 million in 2006 an increase of 4517 million or 135 the increased net operating income in this segment in 2007 over 2006 was primarily due to increased levels of dispositions brought about by increased development activity the creation of new property funds in europe and north america the mpr acquisition as discussed above and additional gains on the sales of land parcels in 2007 325 of the net operating income of this operating segment was generated in north america 368 was generated in europe and 307 was generated in asia in 2006 406 of the net operating income of this segment was generated in north america 320 was generated in europe and 274 was generated in asia 

the cdfs business segment’s net operating income includes the following components for the periods indicated in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 38 

 

  

as discussed earlier given the challenges that we are facing in this current environment and the corresponding changes we have made to our business strategy we do not expect to have significant cdfs gains in 2009 depending on market conditions and other factors we may contribute either completed development properties andor core properties to the property funds or sell to third parties although we will no longer report the sales as cdfs proceeds but instead as gains on the disposition of properties 

 

operational outlook 

 

during the year ended december 31 2008 our property market fundamentals have held up reasonably well notwithstanding the current credit markets which have negatively affected the global economy and our business 

 

in our total operating portfolio including properties owned by our unconsolidated investees and managed by us we leased 1215 million square feet of space during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared with 1086 million square feet in 2007 which included 35 million square feet in china in our direct owned portfolio we leased 768 million square feet including 321 million square feet leased in our development portfolio both completed properties and those under development an important fundamental to our longterm growth is repeat business with our global customers during 2008 54 of the space leased in our newly developed properties was with repeat customers we have begun to see customers deferring moving decisions while assessing the impact of current market conditions on their business which has resulted in a decrease in leasing activity however for the leases that expired in 2008 existing customers renewed their leases 79 of the time although several of our markets have not been impacted overall we expect that leasing will continue to slow and that rents will likely decrease until economic conditions improve 

 

due to the great degree of uncertainty in the global markets we have significantly reduced new development starts during the fourth quarter we halted the development of earlystage projects that aggregated 40 million square feet with a total expected investment of 559 million as of december 31 2008 we had 140 completed development properties that were 435 leased with a current investment of approximately 30 billion and a total expected investment including estimated remaining leasing costs of 32 billion we had 65 properties under development that were 372 leased with a current investment of 12 billion and a total expected investment of 19 billion when completed and leased our nearterm focus will be to complete the development and leasing of these properties once these buildings are leased we may continue to own them directly thereby creating additional income in our direct owned segment or we may contribute them to a property fund or sell to a third party generating cash to reduce our debt 

 

other components of operating income 

 

general and administrative “ga” expenses – and – reduction in workforce 

 

ga expenses were 2043 million in 2008 1932 million in 2007 and 1472 million in 2006 the increases in ga expenses have been related to our investment in the infrastructure necessary to support our business growth and expansion into new and existing international markets the increase in our investment management business our growing portfolio of properties through acquisitions and development and increased contribution activity this increase in infrastructure included additional headcount and a higher level of performancebased 

compensation strengthening foreign currencies account for a portion of the increase when our international operations are translated into us dollars at consolidation 

 

in response to the difficult economic climate we initiated ga expense reductions with a nearterm target of a 20 to 25 percent reduction in ga prior to capitalization in december we implemented a rif plan with a total cost of 264 million including 33 million for china that is included as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations in item 8 in addition we have implemented various cost savings measures in an effort to reduce ga of the total cost of the rif plan 202 million was unpaid and accrued at december 31 2008 the majority of which will be paid by march 31 2009 we may incur rif charges in 2009 for additional employees identified due to our change in business strategy certain of our ga costs are capitalized as a component of our properties under development as our development activities have decreased it is likely the amount we capitalize will decrease and ga costs on a net basis will increase 

 

in each of 2007 and 2006 we recognized 50 million of expense related to a contribution to our charitable foundation 

 

impairment of real estate properties 

 

during 2008 and 2007 we recognized impairment charges of 2747 million and 126 million respectively during 2008 as a result of significant adverse changes in market conditions we reviewed our assets for potential impairment under the appropriate accounting literature we considered current market conditions as well as our intent with regard to owning or disposing of the asset and recognized impairments of certain operating buildings land held for development or sale and predevelopment costs all included in our direct owned segment see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information 

 

depreciation and amortization 

 

depreciation and amortization expenses were 3395 million in 2008 3024 million in 2007 and 2833 million in 2006 the increase in 2008 over 2007 is due primarily to an adjustment in depreciation expense and a higher level of amortization expense related to leasing commissions and other leasing costs as of september 30 2008 we had classified a group of properties that we had developed or acquired with the intent to contribute to a property fund or sell to a third party our policy is to not depreciate these properties during the period from completion until their contribution provided they meet certain criteria with the changes in our business segments and the uncertainty as to when or if these properties will be contributed and our intent to hold and operate these properties in the fourth quarter we recorded an adjustment of 309 million to depreciate these buildings through december 31 2008 based on our policy the increase in 2007 over 2006 is due to acquired real estate assets and intangible lease assets improvements made to the properties in our direct owned segment and increased leasing activity 

 

interest expense 

 

interest expense includes the following components in thousands 

 

 

 

gross interest expense before capitalization decreased in 2008 as compared with the same period in 2007 primarily as a result of additional interest costs incurred in 2007 related to the mpr transaction discussed earlier offset with increased borrowing a function of increased development activities partially offset by contribution activity at lower borrowing rates the increase in our development activities also accounted for 

the increased capitalized interest see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a change in accounting that will be adopted in 2009 and will increase our noncash interest expense between 73 million and 83 million per annum prior to capitalization of interest our future interest expense both gross and the portion capitalized will vary depending on the level of our development activities and the interest rates available 

 

impairment of goodwill and other assets 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we recognized 3206 million of impairment charges associated with goodwill and other assets in connection with our review of the recoverability of goodwill caused by adverse market conditions we recognized an impairment charge of 1754 million related to goodwill in our direct owned segment in europe additionally we recognized an impairment charge of 1452 million related to investments in unconsolidated investees notes receivable and other assets to record these assets at their fair value see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information on our goodwill impairment 

 

gain on early extinguishment of debt 

 

we completed a tender offer in december 2008 by purchasing 3097 million aggregate principal amount of 525 senior notes due november 15 2010 for 2168 million we utilized cash on hand and borrowings under our global lines of credit to fund the tender offer our purchase represents approximately 62 percent of the principal amount of this series of notes outstanding prior to the tender offer in connection with this transaction we recognized a gain of 907 million that is reported as gain on early extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

gains recognized on dispositions of certain noncdfs business assets 

 

in 2008 2007 and 2006 we recognized gains of 117 million 1467 million and 815 million on the disposition of 2 properties 77 properties and 39 properties respectively from our direct owned segment to certain of the unconsolidated property funds due to our continuing involvement through our ownership in the property funds these dispositions are not included in discontinued operations and the gains recognized represent the portion attributable to the third party ownership in the property funds that acquired the properties 

 

foreign currency exchange gains losses net 

 

we and certain of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries have intercompany or third party debt that is not denominated in the entity’s functional currency when the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity a gain or loss may result to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate certain of our intercompany debt is remeasured with the resulting adjustment recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in other comprehensive income loss this treatment is applicable to intercompany debt that is deemed to be longterm in nature if the intercompany debt is deemed shortterm in nature when the debt is remeasured we recognize a gain or loss in earnings 

 

we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of 1483 million during 2008 and net foreign currency exchange gains of 81 million and 214 million during 2007 and 2006 respectively predominantly the gains or losses recognized in earnings relate to the intercompany loans between the us parent and our consolidated subsidiaries in japan and europe due to the fluctuations in the exchange rates of us dollars to the yen euro and pound sterling included in our 2007 foreign currency exchange gains was 266 million from the settlement of several foreign currency forward contracts we purchased to manage the foreign currency fluctuations of the purchase price of mpr which was denominated in australian dollars and closed in 2007 

 

additionally we may utilize derivative financial instruments to manage certain foreign currency exchange risks as of december 31 2008 we have no outstanding contracts see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information on our derivative financial instruments 

income taxes 

 

during 2008 2007 and 2006 our current income tax expense was 634 million 663 million and 835 million respectively we recognize current income tax expense for income taxes incurred by our taxable reit subsidiaries and in certain foreign jurisdictions as well as certain state taxes we also include in current income tax expense the interest associated with our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable cdfs income and changes in tax and interest rates 

 

certain 1999 through 2005 federal and state income tax returns of catellus are currently under audit by the internal revenue service “irs” and various state taxing authorities in november 2008 we agreed to enter into a closing agreement with the irs for the settlement of the 1999 through 2002 audits as a result we increased our unrecognized tax liability by 854 million including interest and penalties as this liability was an income tax uncertainty related to an acquired company we increased goodwill by 666 million related to the liability that existed at the acquisition date the remaining amount is included in current income tax expense in 2008 the payment terms and the closing agreement related to the 2300 million settlement are in the process of being finalized 

 

during 2008 and 2007 we recognized deferred tax expense of 46 million and 05 million respectively and a deferred tax benefit of 537 million in 2006 in 2008 we recognized indemnification liabilities partially offset by a deferred tax benefit related to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities as a result of impairment charges we recorded that reduced the carrying value of certain assets in 2007 we recognized deferred tax expense relating primarily to tax indemnification agreements we entered into during the third quarter of 2007 in connection with the formation of pepf ii and the prologis mexico industrial fund net of the benefit recognized from the termination of the indemnification previously provided to prologis north american properties fund v 

 

the deferred tax benefit recognized in 2006 was primarily the result of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with investments acquired through the catellus merger as well as the reversal of a deferred tax obligation related to pepr we were previously obligated to the preipo unitholders of pepr under a tax indemnification agreement related to properties we contributed to pepr prior to its ipo based on the average closing price of the ordinary units of pepr during the 30day postipo period we were no longer obligated for indemnification with respect to those properties in the fourth quarter of 2006 and we recognized a deferred tax benefit of 368 million related to the reversal of this obligation 

 

our income taxes and the current tax indemnification agreements are discussed in more detail in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

discontinued operations 

 

discontinued operations represent a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale if both the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction the results of operations of the component of the entity that has been classified as discontinued operations are reported separately in our consolidated financial statements 

 

in february 2009 we sold our operations in china to affiliates of gic real estate “gic re” the real estate investment arm of the government of singapore investment corporation accordingly we have classified our china operations as held for sale at december 31 2008 and included the results in discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated statements of operations based on the carrying values of the assets and liabilities to be sold as compared with the estimated sales proceeds less costs to sell we recognized an impairment charge of 1982 million which is included in discontinued operations see additional information on the sale in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

during 2008 2007 and 2006 we disposed of 15 80 and 89 properties respectively as well as land subject to ground leases to third parties that met the requirements to be classified as discontinued operations therefore 

the results of operations for these properties as well as the gain recognized upon disposition are included in discontinued operations in addition to our china operations as of december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we had one two and eight properties respectively classified as held for sale and therefore the results of operations of these properties are also included in discontinued operations see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further discussion of discontinued operations 

 

other comprehensive income loss – foreign currency translation gains losses net 

 

for our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar we translate their financial statements into us dollars at the time we consolidate those subsidiaries’ financial statements generally assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments due to the fluctuations in exchange rates from the beginning of the period to the end of the period are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

 

during the year ended december 31 2008 we recognized losses in other comprehensive income loss of 2796 million related to foreign currency translations of our international business units into us dollars upon consolidation these losses are mainly the result of the strengthening of the us dollar to the euro and pound sterling offset somewhat by the strengthening of the yen to the us dollar from the beginning of the period to december 31 2008 during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 we recognized net gains of 900 million and 708 million respectively due primarily to the strengthening euro and pound sterling to the us dollar from the beginning of the period to december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively 

 

weighted average shares – diluted 

 

during the year ended december 31 2008 approximately 32 of our potentially dilutive stock options and awards were antidilutive due to the decline in our average stock price which caused a decrease in our weighted average common shares outstanding on a dilutive basis the number of dilutive instruments included fluctuates each period based on our stock price for the period this decrease in 2008 was partially offset by the larger number of basic common shares outstanding due to the issuance of shares during the respective periods 

 

portfolio information 

 

our total operating portfolio of properties includes industrial and retail properties owned by us and industrial properties owned by the property funds and joint ventures we manage the operating portfolio does not include properties under development properties held for sale or any other properties owned by unconsolidated investees other than industrial properties and was as follows square feet in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

same store analysis 

 

we evaluate the operating performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures we include properties owned by us and properties owned by the property funds and joint ventures that are managed by us 

referred to as “unconsolidated investees” in our same store analysis we have defined the same store portfolio for the year ended december 31 2008 as those properties that were in operation at january 1 2007 and have been in operation throughout the full periods in both 2008 and 2007 we have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party and properties held for sale including our china operations from the population for both periods we believe the factors that impact rental income rental expenses and net operating income in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total portfolio in order to derive an appropriate measure of periodtoperiod operating performance we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the current exchange rate to translate from local currency into us dollars for both periods to derive the same store results the same store portfolio for the year ended december 31 2008 aggregated 3699 million square feet 

 

the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental income rental expenses and net operating income as included in our consolidated financial statements in item 8 to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis

liquidity and capital resources 

 

overview 

 

we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities contributions and dispositions of properties and from available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development acquisition operating debt service and shareholder distribution requirements 

 

as discussed earlier our current business strategy has a significant emphasis on liquidity at the beginning of the fourth quarter we set a goal to reduce leverage through the reduction of our total debt by 2 billion as of december 31 2009 we intend to accomplish this goal through a number of actions which have included or may include the following depending on market conditions and other factors 

 

  

at december 31 2008 our credit facilities provide aggregate borrowing capacity of 44 billion this includes our global line of credit where a syndicate of banks allows us to draw funds in us dollar euro japanese yen british pound sterling south korean won and canadian dollar “global line” this also includes a multicurrency credit facility that allows us to borrow in us dollar euro japanese yen and british pound sterling “credit facility” and a 35 million british pound sterling facility “sterling facility” the total commitments under our credit facilities fluctuate in us dollars based on the underlying currencies based on our public debt ratings interest on the borrowings under the global line and credit facility primarily accrues at a variable rate based upon the interbank offered rate in each respective jurisdiction in which the borrowings are outstanding 246 per annum at december 31 2008 based on a weighted average using local currency rates 

 

the global line and credit facility mature in october 2009 however we can exercise a 12month extension at our option for all currencies subject to certain customary conditions and the payment of an extension fee 

these customary conditions include i we are not in default ii we have appropriately approved such an extension and iii we certify that certain representations and warranties contained in the agreements are true and correct in all material respects we expect to exercise this option the credit facility provides us the ability to reborrow within a specified period of time any amounts repaid on the facility the sterling facility matures december 31 2009 

 

as of december 31 2008 under these facilities we had outstanding borrowings of 32 billion and letters of credit of 1424 million resulting in remaining borrowing capacity of approximately 11 billion these amounts do not include borrowing capacity of 1060 million with outstanding borrowings of 786 million related to our china operations which are presented as held for sale at december 31 2008 all outstanding amounts related to the china borrowings were refinanced subsequent to december 31 2008 and assumed by the buyer in connection with the sale and we no longer have a renminbi tranche under the global line 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had the following amounts outstanding under all our credit facilities in millions 

 

 

 

in april 2008 we repaid 2500 million of maturing senior notes with available cash in may 2008 we closed on 6000 million of senior notes maturing 2018 with a coupon rate of 6625 and 5500 million of 2625 convertible senior notes the proceeds were used to repay 3466 million of secured debt that was scheduled to mature in november 2008 borrowings on our credit facilities and for general corporate purposes see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information on the convertible notes 

 

in addition to common share distributions and preferred share dividend requirements we expect our primary short and longterm cash needs will consist of the following for 2009 and future years 

 

 47 

 

we expect to fund cash needs for 2009 and future years primarily with cash from the following sources all subject to market conditions 

 

  

we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities contributions and dispositions of properties and from available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated development acquisition operating debt service and shareholder distribution requirements for 2009 

 

we may seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt or equity securities through cash purchases in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material we have approximately 841 million remaining on authorization to repurchase common shares that was approved by our board in 2001 we have not repurchased our common shares since 2003 

 

debt covenants 

 

under the terms of certain of our debt agreements we are currently subject to six different sets of financial covenants that include leverage ratios fixed charge and debt service coverage ratios investments and indebtedness to total asset value ratios minimum consolidated net worth and restrictions on distributions and redemptions the most restrictive covenants relate to the total leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio all covenants are calculated based on the definitions and calculations included in the respective debt agreements 

 

as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

commitments related to future contributions to property funds 

 

the following table outlines acquisitions made by the property funds from prologis and third parties during the year ended december 31 2008 including the related financing of such acquisitions and the remaining equity commitments of the property fund as of december 31 2008 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

generally we fulfill our equity commitment with a portion of the proceeds from properties we contribute to the property fund however to the extent a property fund acquires properties from a third party or requires cash to payoff debt or has other cash needs we may be required to contribute our proportionate share of the equity component in cash to the property fund 

cash provided by operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 8436 million for 2008 12 billion for 2007 and 6873 million for 2006 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2008 over 2007 is due to the decrease in net earnings primarily as a result of lower gains on contributions and dispositions of properties and changes in our operating assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities exceeded the cash distributions paid on common shares and dividends paid on preferred shares in both periods as discussed earlier we do not expect gains from cdfs contributions in 2009 and as a result expect cash flow from operations to also decrease in 2009 over 2008 

 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2007 over 2006 is due primarily to higher cdfs gains on contributions of properties to the property funds in 2007 adjusted for noncash items operational items that impact net cash provided by operating activities are more fully discussed in “ results of operations” cash provided by operating activities exceeded the cash distributions paid on common shares and dividends paid on preferred shares in all periods 

 

cash investing and cash financing activities 

 

for 2008 2007 and 2006 investing activities used net cash of 13 billion 41 billion and 21 billion respectively the following are the more significant activities for all periods presented 

 

 50 

  

  

for 2008 2007 and 2006 financing activities provided net cash of 3581 million 27 billion and 16 billion respectively the following are the more significant activities for all periods presented as summarized below 

 

 51 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

liquidity and capital resources of our unconsolidated investees 

 

we had investments in and advances to property funds at december 31 2008 of 20 billion the property funds had total third party debt of 135 billion for the entire entity not our proportionate share at december 31 2008 that matures as follows dollars in millions 

 

 

 

 

 52 

 

  

contractual obligations 

 

longterm contractual obligations 

 

we had longterm contractual obligations at december 31 2008 as follows in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

other commitments 

 

on a continuing basis we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition andor disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties 

distribution and dividend requirements 

 

our common share distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure we will meet the distribution requirements of the code relative to maintaining our reit status while still allowing us to maximize the cash retained to meet other cash needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities because depreciation is a noncash expense cash flow typically will be greater than operating income and net earnings 

 

cash distributions per common share paid in 2008 2007 and 2006 were 207 184 and 160 respectively in november 2008 the board set the expected annual distribution rate for 2009 at 100 per common share subject to market conditions and reit distribution requirements the payment of common share distributions as well as whether the distribution will be payable in cash or shares of beneficial interest or some combination is dependent upon our financial condition and operating results and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year a cash distribution of 025 per common share for the first quarter of 2009 was declared on february 9 2009 this distribution will be paid on february 27 2009 to holders of common shares on february 19 2009 

 

at december 31 2008 we had three series of preferred shares outstanding the annual dividend rates on preferred shares are 427 per series c preferred share 169 per series f preferred share and 169 per series g preferred share 

 

pursuant to the terms of our preferred shares we are restricted from declaring or paying any distribution with respect to our common shares unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred shares have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the then current dividend period with respect to the preferred shares 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity’s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management generally the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by shareholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance of the accounting policies discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

we assess the carrying values of our respective longlived assets including goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable 

 

recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models quoted market values and third party appraisals where considered necessary if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the longlived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property 

 

generally we use a net asset value analyses to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit where the goodwill is allocated we estimate the current fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals as considered necessary the fair value of the reporting unit also includes an enterprise value that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the particular reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit is then compared with the corresponding book value including goodwill to determine whether there is a potential impairment of the 

goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

 

the use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value are based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business however assumptions and estimates about future cash flows discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective use of other estimates and assumptions may result in changes in the impairment charges recognized changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our real estate properties andor goodwill in addition our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change as well as other factors especially in the current global economic environment 

 

investments in unconsolidated investees 

 

when circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity investment we evaluate the investment for impairment by estimating our ability to recover our investments from future expected cash flows if we determine the loss in value is other than temporary we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value the use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value the determination of when a loss is other than temporary and the calculation of the amount of the loss is complex and subjective use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our equity investments 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets generally at the time the title is transferred consideration is received and we have no future involvement as a direct owner of the real estate asset contributed or sold in many of our transactions an entity in which we have an ownership interest will acquire a real estate asset from us we make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the investee that acquires the assets we also make judgments regarding the timing of recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives when they are fixed and determinable 

 

business combinations 

 

we acquire individual properties as well as portfolios of properties or businesses when we acquire a property for investment purposes we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component the components typically include land building debt and other assumed liabilities and intangible assets related to above and below market leases value of costs to obtain tenants and goodwill deferred tax liabilities and other assets and liabilities in the case of an acquisition of a business in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often times based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment which may differ when final information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period which typically does not exceed one year 

 

consolidation 

 

our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of prologis and all entities that we control either through ownership of a majority voting interest or as the general partner and variable interest entities when we are the primary beneficiary investments in entities in which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity 

method investments in entities that we do not control and over which we do not exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as appropriate our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity involve the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest our representation on the entity’s governing body the size of our investment including loans estimates of future cash flows our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager andor liquidate the venture if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements 

 

capitalization of costs and depreciation 

 

we capitalize costs incurred in developing renovating acquiring and rehabilitating real estate assets as part of the investment basis costs incurred in making certain other improvements are also capitalized during the land development and construction periods we capitalize interest costs insurance real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development renovations rehabilitation and leasing activities if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets except for the costs capitalized related to leasing activities which are presented as a component of other assets we estimate the depreciable portion of our real estate assets and related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense we generally do not depreciate properties during the period from the completion of the development rehabilitation or repositioning activities through the date the properties are contributed or sold our ability to accurately assess the properties to depreciate and to estimate the depreciable portions of our real estate assets and useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets any change to the assets to be depreciated and the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized 

 

income taxes 

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to estimate our current income tax liability the liability associated with open tax years that are under review and our compliance with reit requirements our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws we estimate our actual current income tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities these estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain nonroutine transactions changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities our inability to qualify as a reit the potential for builtingain recognition changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to trss and changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision in the statements of operations other than adjustments to income tax liabilities due to tax uncertainties acquired in a business combination which are adjusted to goodwill through december 31 2008 we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is “morelikelythannot” that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

funds from operations 

 

ffo is a nongaap measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings although nareit has published a definition of ffo modifications to the nareit calculation of ffo are common among reits as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business ffo as we define it is presented as a supplemental financial measure 

we do not use ffo as nor should it be considered to be an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of our ability to fund our cash needs 

 

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor do we intend it to present a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance we believe net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap further we believe our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition and our operating performance 

 

nareit’s ffo measure adjusts net earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated properties we agree that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

a historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes through depreciation charges that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time nareit stated in its white paper on ffo “since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves” consequently nareit’s definition of ffo reflects the fact that real estate as an asset class generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by gaap do not reflect the underlying economic realities 

 

b reits were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of longterm ownership and management of real estate the exclusion in nareit’s definition of ffo of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the longterm assets that form the core of a reit’s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods we include the gains and losses from dispositions of land development properties and properties acquired in our cdfs business segment as well as our proportionate share of the gains and losses from dispositions recognized by the property funds in our definition of ffo 

 

at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo concept for the reit industry it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community” we believe financial analysts potential investors and shareholders who review our operating results are best served by a defined ffo measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of ffo 

 

our defined ffo including significant noncash items measure excludes the following items from net earnings computed under gaap that are not excluded in the nareit defined ffo measure

ffo including significant noncash items of our unconsolidated investees is calculated on the same basis 

 

in addition we present ffo excluding significant noncash items in order to derive ffo excluding significant non cash items we add back certain charges or subtract certain gains the items that were currently excluded were impairment charges that we incurred directly or through our investment in unconsolidated investees as well as a gain from the early extinguishment of debt the impairment charges were related to certain of our real estate properties including land goodwill and other assets and our china operations that were sold in february 2009 these items are a reflection of decreases in current values driven by increases in current estimated capitalization rates and other declines in market conditions we believe it is meaningful to remove the effects of significant noncash items to more appropriately present our results on a comparative basis 

 

the items that we exclude from net earnings computed under gaap while not infrequent or unusual are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions most importantly the economics underlying the items that we exclude from net earnings computed under gaap are not the primary drivers in management’s decisionmaking process and capital investment decisions period to period fluctuations in these items can be driven by accounting for shortterm factors that are not relevant to longterm investment decisions longterm capital structures or longterm tax planning and tax structuring decisions accordingly we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy 

 

real estate is a capitalintensive business investors’ analyses of the performance of real estate companies tend to be centered on understanding the asset value created by real estate investment decisions and understanding current operating returns that are being generated by those same investment decisions the adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap that are included in arriving at our ffo measure are helpful to management in making real estate investment decisions and evaluating our current operating performance we believe these adjustments are also helpful to industry analysts potential investors and shareholders in their understanding and evaluation of our performance on the key measures of net asset value and current operating returns generated on real estate investments 

 

while we believe our defined ffo measures are an important supplemental measures neither nareit’s nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are therefore limited as an analytical tool some of these limitations are 

 

 58 

  

  

we compensate for these limitations by using the ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap to further compensate we reconcile our defined ffo measures to net earnings computed under gaap in our financial reports additionally we provide investors with i our complete financial statements prepared under gaap ii our definition of ffo which includes a discussion of the limitations of using our nongaap measure and iii a reconciliation of our gaap measure net earnings to our nongaap measure ffo as we define it so that investors can appropriately incorporate this measure and its limitations into their analyses 

 

ffo including significant noncash items attributable to common shares as defined by us was 1809 million 12270 million and 9451 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively ffo excluding significant noncash items attributable to common shares as defined by us was 9919 million 12270 million and 9451 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the reconciliations of net earnings attributable to common shares computed under gaap to both ffo including 

significant noncash items attributable to common shares and ffo excluding significant noncash items attributable to common shares as defined by us are as follows for the periods indicated in thousands 

 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreignexchange related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments we have used certain derivative financial instruments primarily foreign currency put option and forward contracts to reduce our foreign currency market risk as we deem appropriate currently we do not have any such instruments outstanding we have also used interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate market risk we do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with established polices and procedures 

 

we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in year end interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

 

our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to achieve this objective we primarily borrow on a fixed rate basis for longerterm debt issuances we had no interest rate swap contracts outstanding at december 31 2008 

 

our primary interest rate risk is created by the variable rate lines of credit during the year ended december 31 2008 we had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of 32 billion on our variable rate lines of credit based on the results of the sensitivity analysis which assumed a 10 adverse change in interest rates the estimated market risk exposure for the variable rate lines of credit was approximately 106 million of cash flow for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

we also have 250 million of variable interest rate debt in which we have a market risk of increased rates based on a sensitivity analysis with a 10 adverse change in interest rates our estimated market risk exposure for this issuance is approximately 06 million on our cash flow for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

in addition as a result of a change in accounting effective january 1 2009 we expect our noncash interest expense to increase between 73 million and 83 million per annum prior to capitalization of interest as a result of our development activities see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information 

 

the unconsolidated property funds that we manage and in which we have an equity ownership may enter into interest rate swap contracts see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information on these derivatives 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates to the translation of the net income of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars principally euro pound sterling and yen to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate we also may use foreign currency put option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the projected net operating income of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees at december 31 2008 we had no put option contracts outstanding and therefore we may experience fluctuations in our earnings as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

we also have some exposure to movements in exchange rates related to certain intercompany loans we issue from time to time and we may use foreign currency forward contracts to manage these risks at december 31 2008 we had no forward contracts outstanding and therefore we may experience fluctuations in our earnings from the remeasurement of these intercompany loans due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates

 item 1 business 

 

prologis 

 

we are the world’s largest owner manager and developer of industrial distribution facilities we designed our business strategy to achieve longterm sustainable growth in cash flow and a high level of return for our shareholders we manage our business by utilizing the prologis operating system ®  an organizational structure and service delivery system that we built around our customers when combined with our international network of distribution properties the prologis operating system enables us to meet our customers’ needs for distribution space on a global basis we believe that by integrating international scope and expertise with a strong local presence in our markets we have become an attractive choice for our targeted customer base the largest global users of distribution space 

 

we are a maryland real estate investment trust “reit” and have elected to be taxed as such under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” our world headquarters is located in denver colorado our european headquarters is located in the grand duchy of luxembourg with our european customer service headquarters located in amsterdam the netherlands our primary offices in asia are located in tokyo japan and shanghai china 

 

our internet website address is wwwprologiscom all reports required to be filed with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” are available or may be accessed free of charge through the investor relations section of our internet website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the sec our internet website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this annual report on form 10k our common shares trade under the ticker symbol “pld” on the new york stock exchange 

 

business strategy and global presence 

 

we were formed in 1991 as an owner of industrial distribution space operating in the united states with a primary objective of differentiating ourselves from our competition by focusing on our corporate customers’ distribution space requirements on a national regional and local basis and providing customers with consistent levels of service throughout the united states as our customers’ needs expanded to markets outside the united states so did our portfolio and our management team we currently have operations in north america europe and asia we are exploring opportunities in india and recently announced a development fee project in dubai united arab emirates our business strategy is to hold certain investments on a longterm basis and generate income from leasing space to our customers develop properties primarily for contribution to property 

funds in which we maintain an ownership interest and manage those property funds and the properties they own since our inception we have grown and expect continued growth through the development and selective acquisition of properties individually and as portfolios in targeted markets in september 2005 we completed a merger whereby catellus development corporation “catellus” was merged into one of our subsidiaries the “catellus merger” and added approximately 45 billion of real estate assets to our direct owned investments at that time we added certain retail properties to our portfolio due to the similarities with our industrial distribution properties this investment in retail along with our investments in cdfs joint ventures that develop retail and mixeduse properties gives us opportunities to diversify our revenue base but also exposes us to the potential risks of the retail and mixeduse sector as of december 31 2007 our direct owned real estate investments totaled 166 billion 

 

distribution facilities are a crucial link in the modern supply chain and they serve three primary purposes for supplychain participants i ensure accurate and seamless flow of goods to their appointed destinations ii function as processing centers for goods and iii enable companies to store enough inventory to meet surges in demand and to cushion themselves from the impact of a break in the supply chain 

 

the primary business drivers across the globe continue to be the need for greater distribution network efficiency and stateoftheart facilities to support the growing business of global trade after 16 years in operation our focus on our customers’ expanding needs and improving their supplychain operations has enabled us to become the world’s largest owner manager and developer of industrial distribution facilities 

 

at december 31 2007 our total portfolio of properties owned managed and under development including directowned properties and properties owned by property funds and cdfs joint ventures consisted of 2773 properties aggregating 5102 million square feet and serving 4912 customers in 118 markets in north america europe and asia 

 

our operating segments 

 

our business is primarily organized into three reportable business segments i property operations ii investment management and iii development or cdfs business the following discussion of our business segments should be read in conjunction with “item 1a risk factors” our property 


 item 1a risk factors tableend  

our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of our common shares these risks include among others 

 

general real estate risks 

 

general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results 

 

we are exposed to the general economic conditions the local regional national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties approximately 220 of our properties based on our investment before depreciation are located in california properties in california may be more susceptible to certain types of natural disasters such as earthquakes brush fires flooding and mudslides than properties located in other markets and a major natural disaster in california could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we also have significant holdings defined as more than 35 of our total investment before depreciation in operating properties in certain markets located in atlanta chicago dallasfort worth new jersey japan poland the united kingdom and washington dcbaltimore maryland our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties conditions such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space among other factors may impact operating conditions any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction in demand for distribution space could adversely affect our results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of our securities in addition the property funds and cdfs joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest have concentrations of properties in the same markets 

 

real property investments are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business 

 

real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio market research and our property management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated some of the factors that may affect real estate values include 

 

 15 

 

  

our investments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector or an unanticipated change in the supply chain dynamics 

 

our investments in real estate assets are primarily concentrated in the industrial distribution sector this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included a more significant portion of other sectors of the real estate industry 

 

our real estate development strategies may not be successful 

 

we have developed a significant number of distribution properties since our inception and intend to continue to pursue development activities as opportunities arise in addition we currently own approximately 9351 acres of land or land use rights for potential future development of distribution properties and other commercial real estate projects such development activities generally require various government and other approvals and we may not receive such approvals we will be subject to risks associated with such development activities including but not limited to 

 

  

our business strategy associated with contributing properties to property funds or disposing of properties to third parties may not be successful 

 

we have contributed to property funds or sold to third parties a significant number of distribution properties in recent years and we intend to continue to contribute and sell properties particularly from our cdfs business segment which is an integral part of our business strategy our ability to contribute or sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties current market conditions including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties and other factors beyond our control our ability to develop and timely lease properties will impact our ability to contribute or sell these properties the property funds are required to have access to debt and equity capital in the private and public markets in order for us to continue our strategy of contributing properties to them should we not have sufficient properties available that meet the investment criteria of current or future property funds or should the property funds have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then these contributions could be delayed resulting in adverse effects on our liquidity and on our ability 

to meet projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period failure to meet our projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period could have an adverse effect on our results of operations distributable cash flow and on the value of our securities further our inability to redeploy the proceeds from our divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy could have an adverse effect on our results of operations distributable cash flow our ability to meet our debt obligations in a timely manner and the value of our securities in subsequent periods 

 

our growth will depend on future acquisitions of distribution properties which involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results and the value of our securities 

 

we acquire distribution properties in both our property operations and cdfs business segments the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates there is and it is expected there will continue to be significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities 

 

our operating results and distributable cash flow will depend on the continued generation of lease revenues from customers 

 

our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations we are also subject to the risk that upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties leases may not be renewed by existing customers the space may not be released to new customers or the terms of renewal or releasing including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers may be less favorable to us than current lease terms in the event of default by a significant number of customers we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord a customer may experience a downturn in its business which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease in addition a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow 

 

our ability to renew leases or release space on favorable terms as leases expire significantly affects our business 

 

our results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of our securities would be adversely affected if we were unable to lease on economically favorable terms a significant amount of space in our operating properties we have 317 million square feet of distribution and retail space out of a total of 1756 million occupied square feet or 181 with leases that expire in 2008 including 18 million square feet of leases that are on a monthtomonth basis in addition our unconsolidated investees have a combined 332 million square feet of distribution space out of a total 2398 million occupied square feet or 138 with leases that expire in 2008 including 20 million square feet of leases that are on a monthtomonth basis the number of distribution and retail properties in a market or submarket could adversely affect both our ability to release the space and the rental rates that can be obtained in new leases 

 

the fact that real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of assets may reduce economic returns to investors 

 

real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions in addition significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments like other companies qualifying as reits under the code we must comply with the safe harbor rules relating to the number of properties that can be disposed of in a year the tax basis and the costs of improvements made to these properties and meet other tests that enable a reit to avoid punitive taxation on the sale of assets thus 

our ability at any time to sell assets or contribute assets to property funds or other entities in which we have an ownership interest may be restricted 

 

our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses 

 

we and our unconsolidated investees currently carry insurance coverage including property liability fire named windstorm flood earthquake environmental terrorism extended coverage and rental loss as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets we believe our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated investees including the property funds are adequately insured however there are certain losses including losses from floods earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property 

 

we are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances 

 

a majority of the properties we acquire are subjected to environmental reviews either by us or by the predecessor owners in addition we may incur environmental remediation costs associated with certain land parcels we acquire in connection with the development of the land in connection with the catellus merger we acquired certain properties in urban and industrial areas that may have been leased to or previously owned by commercial and industrial companies that discharged hazardous materials we establish a liability at the time of acquisition to cover such costs we purchase various environmental insurance policies to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the presence of such substances on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow 

 

risks related to financing and capital 

 

our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we do not continue to have access to capital through the property funds 

 

as a reit we are required to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders consequently we are as are all reits largely dependent on external capital to fund our development and acquisition activities we have been accessing debt and equity capital in both the private and public markets through the establishment of property funds that acquire our properties our ability to access capital through the property funds is dependent upon a number of factors including general market conditions and competition from other real estate companies further we generate significant profits because of the contributions of properties to the property funds to the extent that capital is not available to the property funds to allow them to acquire our properties these profits may not be realized or realization may be delayed which could result in an earnings stream that is less predictable than some of our competitors and may result in us not meeting our projected earnings and distributable cash flow levels in a particular reporting period our ability to contribute or sell properties from our development pipeline and recognize profits from our development 

activities will be jeopardized and our ability to meet projected earnings levels and generate distributable cash flow would be adversely affected should the existing equity commitments to the property funds not be available due to investor default or otherwise such that these property funds cannot acquire the properties that we expect to have available for contribution this impact would occur in the shortterm and would continue until we are able to sell the properties to third parties or until we could secure another source of capital to finance the properties failure to meet our projected earnings and distributable cash flow levels in a particular reporting period could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and on the market price of our securities 

 

our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to make required payments on our debt or are unable to refinance our debt 

 

we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected and if the maturing debt is secured the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness our unsecured credit facilities and certain other unsecured debt bear interest at variable rates increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements in addition our unconsolidated investees have shortterm debt that was used to acquire properties from us or third parties and other maturing indebtedness if these investees are unable to refinance their indebtedness or meet their payment obligations it may impact our distributable cash flow and our financial condition 

 

covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition 

 

the terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected 

 

federal income tax risks 

 

failure to qualify as a reit could adversely affect our cash flows 

 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1993 in addition we have a consolidated subsidiary that has elected to be taxed as a reit and certain unconsolidated investees that are reits and are subject to all the risks pertaining to the reit structure discussed herein to maintain reit status we must meet a number of highly technical requirements on a continuing basis those requirements seek to ensure among other things that the gross income and investments of a reit are largely real estate related that a reit distributes substantially all of its ordinary taxable income to shareholders on a current basis and that the reit’s equity ownership is not overly concentrated due to the complex nature of these rules the available guidance concerning interpretation of the rules the importance of ongoing factual determinations and the possibility of adverse changes in the law administrative interpretations of the law and changes in our business no assurance can be given that we or our reit subsidiaries will qualify as a reit for any particular period 

 

if we fail to qualify as a reit we will be taxed as a regular corporation and distributions to shareholders will not be deductible in computing our taxable income the resulting corporate income tax liabilities could materially reduce our cash flow and funds available for reinvestment moreover we might not be able to elect to be treated as a reit for the four taxable years after the year during which we ceased to qualify as a reit in addition if we later requalified as a reit we might be required to pay a full corporatelevel tax on any 

unrealized gains in our assets as of the date of requalification and to make distributions to our shareholders equal to any earnings accumulated during the period of nonreit status 

 

potential adverse effect of reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our financial condition 

 

to maintain qualification as a reit under the code a reit must annually distribute to its shareholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains this requirement limits our ability to accumulate capital and therefore we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements difficulties in meeting the distribution requirements might arise due to competing demands for our funds or to timing differences between tax reporting and cash receipts and disbursements because income may have to be reported before cash is received or because expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed in addition the internal revenue service the “irs” may make a determination in connection with the settlement of an audit by the irs that increases taxable income or disallows or limits deductions taken thereby increasing the distribution we are required to make in those situations we might be required to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements and interest and penalties could apply which could adversely affect our financial condition if we fail to make a required distribution we would cease to qualify as a reit 

 

prohibited transaction income could result from certain property transfers 

 

we contribute properties to property funds and sell properties to third parties from the reit and from taxable reit subsidiaries “trs” under the code a disposition of a property from other than a trs could be deemed a prohibited transaction in such case a 100 penalty tax on the resulting gain could be assessed the determination that a transaction constitutes a prohibited transaction is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction the irs could contend that certain contributions or sales of properties by us are prohibited transactions while we do not believe the irs would prevail in such a dispute if the irs successfully argued the matter the 100 penalty tax could be assessed against the gains from these transactions which may be significant additionally any gain from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 

 

liabilities recorded for preexisting tax audits may not be sufficient 

 

we are subject to pending audits by the irs and the california franchise tax board of the 1999 through 2005 income tax returns of catellus including certain of its subsidiaries and partnerships we have recorded an accrual for the liabilities that may arise from these audits the audits may result in an adjustment in which the actual liabilities or settlement costs including interest and potential penalties if any may prove to be more than the liability we have recorded see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

uncertainties relating to catellus’ estimate of its “earnings and profits” attributable to ccorporation taxable years may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow 

 

in order to qualify as a reit a reit cannot have at the end of any reit taxable year any undistributed earnings and profits that are attributable to a ccorporation taxable year a reit has until the close of its first full taxable year as a reit in which it has nonreit earnings and profits to distribute these accumulated earnings and profits because catellus’ first full taxable year as a reit was 2004 catellus was required to distribute these earnings and profits prior to the end of 2004 failure to meet this requirement would result in catellus’ disqualification as a reit catellus distributed its accumulated nonreit earnings and profits in december 2003 well in advance of the 2004 yearend deadline and believed that this distribution was sufficient to distribute all of its nonreit earnings and profits however the determination of nonreit earnings and profits is complicated and depends upon facts with respect to which catellus may have less than complete information or the application of the law governing earnings and profits which is subject to differing interpretations or both consequently there are substantial uncertainties relating to the estimate of catellus’ nonreit earnings and profits and we cannot be assured that the earnings and profits distribution requirement has been met these uncertainties include the possibility that the irs could upon audit as discussed above 

increase the taxable income of catellus which would increase the nonreit earnings and profits of catellus there can be no assurances that we have satisfied the requirement that catellus distribute all of its nonreit earnings and profits by the close of its first taxable year as a reit and therefore this may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow 

 

there are potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities that could affect our operating results or financial condition 

 

palmtree acquisition corporation our subsidiary that was the surviving corporation in the catellus merger is subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate currently 35 and potential state taxes on any gain recognized within ten years of catellus’ conversion to a reit from a disposition of any assets that catellus held at the effective time of its election to be a reit but only to the extent of the builtingain based on the fair market value of those assets on the effective date of the reit election which was january 1 2004 gain from a sale of an asset occurring more than 10 years after the reit conversion will not be subject to this corporatelevel tax we do not currently expect to dispose of any asset of the surviving corporation in the merger if such disposition would result in the imposition of a material tax liability unless we can affect a taxdeferred exchange of the property however certain assets are subject to third party purchase options that may require us to sell such assets and those assets may carry deferred tax liabilities that would be triggered on such sales we have recorded deferred tax liabilities related to these builtingains there can be no assurances that our plans in this regard will not change and if such plans do change or if a purchase option is exercised that we will be successful in structuring a taxdeferred exchange 

 

other risks 

 

we are dependent on key personnel 

 

our executive and other senior officers have a significant role in our success our ability to retain our management group or to attract suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market the loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their availability could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow further such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets 

 

share prices may be affected by market interest rates 

 

the annual distribution rate on common shares as a percentage of our market price may influence the trading price of such common shares an increase in market interest rates may lead investors to demand a higher annual distribution rate than we have set which could adversely affect the value of our common shares 

 

as a global company we are subject to social political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states during 2007 we generated approximately 42 of our revenue from operations outside the united states circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

 

 21 

 

  

although we have committed substantial resources to expand our global development platform if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

 

in addition our international operations and specifically the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt may be affected by currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other things 

 

the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

 

we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the national currency at december 31 2007 approximately 45 of our total assets are invested in a currency other than the us dollar primarily the euro japanese yen british pound sterling and chinese renminbi as a result we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and on occasion and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative contracts there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful 

 

we are subject to governmental regulations and actions that affect operating results and financial condition 

 

many laws and governmental regulations apply to us our unconsolidated investees and our properties changes in these laws and governmental regulations or their interpretation by agencies or the courts could occur which might affect our ability to conduct business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report and the matters described under “item 1a risk factors” 

 

management’s overview 

 

we are a selfadministered and selfmanaged reit that operates a global network of real estate properties primarily industrial distribution properties the primary business drivers continue to be the need for greater distribution network efficiency and the continued growth in global trade our focus on our customers’ expanding needs has enabled us to become the world’s largest owner manager and developer of industrial distribution properties 

 

our business is organized into three reportable business segments i property operations ii investment management and iii development or cdfs business our property operations segment represents the direct longterm ownership of distribution and retail properties our investment management segment represents the longterm investment management of property funds and the properties they own our cdfs business segment primarily encompasses our development or acquisition of real estate properties that are subsequently contributed to a property fund in which we have an ownership interest and act as manager or sold to third parties 

 

we generate and seek to increase revenues earnings ffo and cash flows through our segments primarily as follows

summary of 2007 

 

the fundamentals of our business continued to be strong in each of our business segments in 2007 

 

we increased our net operating income from our property operations segment to 7373 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 6484 million for the same period in 2006 the increase of 137 was primarily a result of us owning a larger operating portfolio during 2007 over 2006 as well as an increase in same store net operating income as defined below for these properties our directowned operating portfolio increased due to acquisitions and development of 356 operating properties and decreased due to contributions and dispositions of 420 properties resulting in a directowned operating portfolio of 1409 properties at december 31 2007 the timing of our contributions impacts the net operating income recognized in this segment 

 

our net operating income from the investment management segment was 1992 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 3050 million for 2006 in 2007 we recognized 382 million that represented our proportionate share of the gain recognized by prologis european properties “pepr” upon the sale of certain properties in 2006 we recognized 1683 million of earnings and incentive returns associated with pepr’s initial public offering “ipo” 1092 million and the termination of three of the property funds in north america as further discussed below 591 million excluding these items from 2007 and 2006 net operating income from this segment increased 243 million or 178 due primarily to the new property funds created in 2007 and 2006 and an increase in the number of properties managed by us on behalf of the property funds 

 

we increased our total operating portfolio of distribution and retail properties owned or managed including directowned properties and properties owned by the property funds and cdfs joint ventures to 4595 million square feet at december 31 2007 from 3914 million square feet at december 31 2006 this increase is primarily in the portfolio of properties owned by the property funds which increased from 843 properties at december 31 2006 to 1131 properties at december 31 2007 due to the formation of new property funds contributions by us and acquisitions from third parties our stabilized leased percentage as 

defined below was 956 at december 31 2007 compared with 953 at december 31 2006 our same store net operating income increased by 52 and our same store average occupancy increased by 29 for the year ended december 31 2007 over the same period in 2006 in 2007 same store rental rates on new leases increased 80 over the previous rental rates on that space 

 

net operating income of the cdfs business segment increased for the year ended december 31 2007 to 7899 million from 3795 million for the same period in 2006 this increase of 108 was due primarily to increased levels of contributions brought about by increased development activity the creation of two new property funds that acquired properties from us as well as the acquisition of mpr and subsequent formation of a new fund that resulted in gains of 686 million in 2007 and is further discussed below during the year ended december 31 2007 we started development on projects with a total expected cost at completion of 39 billion and completed development projects with a total expected cost of 24 billion most of which will be contributed to property funds in future periods we believe our strong development and leasing activity along with the access to capital through the property funds will continue to support our contribution activity to the property funds 

 

key transactions in 2007 

 

  

  

  

 34 

 

  

  

critical accounting policies 

 

a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity’s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management generally the judgment requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current economic conditions changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by shareholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance of the accounting policies discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets generally at the time the title is transferred consideration is received and we have no future involvement as a direct owner of the real estate asset contributed or sold in many of our transactions an entity in which we have an ownership interest will acquire a real estate asset from us we make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the investee that acquires the assets we also make judgments regarding the timing of recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives when they are fixed and determinable 

business combinations 

 

we acquire individual properties as well as portfolios of properties or businesses when we acquire a property for investment purposes we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component the components typically include land building debt and other assumed liabilities and intangible assets related to above and below market leases value of costs to obtain tenants and goodwill deferred tax liabilities and other assets and liabilities in the case of an acquisition of a business in an acquisition of multiple properties we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often times based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment which may differ when final information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period which typically does not exceed one year 

 

consolidation 

 

our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of prologis and all entities that we control either through ownership of a majority voting interest or as the general partner and variable interest entities when we are the primary beneficiary investments in entities in which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method investments in entities that we do not control and over which we do not exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as appropriate our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity involve the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest our representation on the entity’s governing body the size of our investment including loans estimates of future cash flows our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager andor liquidate the venture if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements 

 

capitalization of costs and depreciation 

 

we capitalize costs incurred in developing renovating acquiring and rehabilitating real estate assets as part of the investment basis costs incurred in making certain other improvements are also capitalized during the land development and construction periods we capitalize interest costs insurance real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development renovations rehabilitation and leasing activities if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets except for the costs capitalized related to leasing activities which are presented as a component of other assets we estimate the depreciable portion of our real estate assets and related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense we generally do not depreciate properties during the period from the completion of the development rehabilitation or repositioning activities through the date the properties are contributed or sold our ability to accurately assess the properties to depreciate and to estimate the depreciable portions of our real estate assets and useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets any change to the assets to be depreciated and the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

we assess the carrying value of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and with respect to goodwill at least annually applying a fairvaluebased test the determination of the fair value of longlived assets including goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of the future 

operating results and resulting cash flows of each longlived asset our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows affects the determination of fair value 

 

if there is a decline in the fair value of a longlived asset or a history of the asset generating operating losses we determine whether the operating losses associated with the asset will continue our assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is primarily based on estimates of future operating results the resulting cash flows and our intent to either hold or dispose of the longlived asset if an investment is considered impaired an impairment charge is recognized based on these analyses 

 

income taxes 

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to estimate our current income tax liability the liability associated with open tax years that are under review and our compliance with reit requirements our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws we estimate our actual current income tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities these estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain nonroutine transactions changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities our inability to qualify as a reit the potential for builtingain recognition changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to trss and changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision in the statements of earnings other than adjustments to income tax liabilities due to tax uncertainties acquired in a business combination which are adjusted to goodwill effective january 1 2007 we adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 ” “fin 48” which changed our methodology for estimating potential liabilities for income tax related matters under fin 48 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is “morelikelythannot” that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities 

 

results of operations 

 

information for the years ended december 31 regarding net earnings attributable to common shares was as follows 

 

 

 

the increase in net earnings in 2007 over 2006 is primarily due to increased gains on contributions of cdfs and noncdfs properties to property funds higher gains on sales of land and improved property operating performance partially offset by lower incentive fees from property funds and lower gains on sales of properties to third parties the increase in gains on contributions was fueled by the creation of two new property funds who acquired properties from us in 2007 and the repositioning of one property fund with a new partner the increase in net earnings attributable to common shares in 2006 over 2005 was due to increases in the earnings of each of our reportable business segments driven by the pepr ipo the liquidation of certain property funds improved property operating performance gains on dispositions of properties and the catellus merger 

 

portfolio information 

 

in the discussion that follows we present the results of operations by reportable business segment see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further description of our segments our total operating portfolio of properties includes distribution and retail properties owned by us and distribution 

properties owned by the property funds and cdfs joint ventures our operating portfolio also includes properties that were developed or acquired in our cdfs business segment and are pending contribution to a property fund or disposition to a third party the operating portfolio does not include properties under development or any other properties owned by the cdfs joint ventures other than distribution properties and was as follows square feet in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

the stabilized operating properties owned by us the property funds and the cdfs joint ventures were 956 leased at december 31 2007 953 leased at december 31 2006 and 945 leased at december 31 2005 the stabilized properties are those properties where the capital improvements repositioning efforts new management and new marketing programs for acquisitions or the marketing programs in the case of newly developed properties have been completed and in effect for a sufficient period of time to achieve stabilization a property generally enters the stabilized pool at the earlier of 12 months from acquisition or completion or when it becomes substantially occupied which we generally define as 930 

 

same store analysis 

 

we evaluate the operating performance of the operating properties included in each of our three reportable business segments using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures we include properties owned by us the property funds and the cdfs joint ventures in the same store analysis accordingly we define the same store portfolio of operating properties for each period as those properties that have been in operation throughout the full period in both the current and prior year when a property is disposed of to a third party it is removed from the population for all periods presented the same store portfolio aggregated 3321 million square feet at december 31 2007 

 

same store results were as follows 

 

 38 

 

  

we believe the factors that impact net operating income rental rates and average occupancy in the same store portfolio are the same as for the total portfolio in order to derive an appropriate measure of periodtoperiod operating performance the percentage change computation removes the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by computing each property’s components in that property’s functional currency 

 

rental income computed under gaap applicable to the properties included in the same store portfolio is adjusted to remove the net termination and renegotiation fees recognized in each period net termination and renegotiation fees excluded from rental income for the same store portfolio including properties directly owned and properties owned by the property funds and cdfs joint ventures were 29 million and 55 million for the year ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease offset by the writeoff of the asset recognized due to the adjustment to straightline rents over the lease term removing the net termination fees from the same store calculation of rental income allows us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property’s rental income without regard to items that are not indicative of the property’s recurring operating performance 

 

in computing the percentage change in rental expenses the rental expenses applicable to the properties in the same store portfolio include property management expenses for our directowned properties these expenses are based on the property management fee that is provided for in the individual agreements under which our wholly owned management company provides property management services to each property generally the fee is based on a percentage of revenues on consolidation the management fee income earned by the management company and the management fee expense recognized by the properties are eliminated and the direct costs of providing property management services are recognized as part of our rental expenses reported under gaap 

 

operational outlook 

 

changes in economic conditions will generally affect customer leasing decisions and absorption of new distribution properties since late 2004 we have experienced strong customer demand and continued strengthening in occupancies across our global markets growth in global trade continues to support our market fundamentals which in turn support the leasing activity in our global development pipeline during the year ended december 31 2007 in our total operating portfolio including properties owned by our unconsolidated investees and managed by us we executed 1086 million square feet of leases this includes 329 million square feet of initial leasing activity in new developments and repositioned acquisitions bringing our stabilized portfolio to 956 leased at december 31 2007 we consider our stabilized portfolio to be substantially occupied and therefore do not expect our overall leased percentage to increase much above the current level market rental rates are increasing in many of our markets and we have experienced positive rental rate growth in the aggregate for the past seven quarters as a result we expect to continue to see increasing rents in most of our markets and we expect absorption of available space in our global development pipeline to continue to be healthy in 2008 an important fundamental to our longterm growth is repeat business with our global customers historically approximately half of the space leased in our newly developed properties is with repeat customers 54 for 2007 

 

property operations segment 

 

the net operating income of the property operations segment consists of rental income and rental expenses from the distribution and retail operating properties that we own directly the costs of our property management function for both our directowned portfolio and the properties owned by the property funds are all reported in rental expenses in the property operations segment the rental income and expenses of 

operating properties that we developed or acquired in the cdfs business segment are included in the property operations segment during the interim period from the date of completion or acquisition through the date the properties are contributed or sold see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a reconciliation of net operating income to earnings before minority interest the net operating income from the property operations segment excluding amounts presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements was as follows in thousands 

 

 

 

the number and composition of operating properties that we own throughout the periods and the timing of contributions impact rental income and rental expenses for each period as discussed earlier on july 11 2007 we completed the acquisition of mpr which resulted in us consolidating the operating results until august 27 2007 at which point the lender converted certain of the bridge debt into equity in prologis north american industrial fund ii thereby reducing our ownership to 369 of the equity of the property fund at this time we no longer controlled the property fund and began to account for our investment under the equity method of accounting in our investment management segment the property operations segment includes the rental income and expenses of those properties during the time we owned them in our direct owned portfolio when a property is contributed to a property fund we begin reporting our share of the earnings of the property under the equity method in the investment management segment however the overhead costs incurred by us to provide the management services to the property fund continue to be reported as part of rental expenses 

 

the increases in rental income and rental expenses in 2007 over 2006 are due to us owning more properties in 2007 than 2006 as a result of the mpr acquisition and the timing of contributions as well as increases in the net operating income of the same store properties we own directly the increases in rental income and rental expenses in 2006 over 2005 are due primarily to the increase in properties owned resulting from the catellus merger in the third quarter of 2005 and other acquisitions and increases in the net operating income of the same store properties we directly own under the terms of our lease agreements some or all of our rental expenses are recovered from customers these rental expense recoveries of 2178 million 1800 million and 1125 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively are included in rental income and offset some of the increases in rental expenses the increase in the number of properties under management has also contributed to the increase in rental expenses 

 

investment management segment 

 

the net operating income of the investment management segment consists of i earnings or losses recognized under the equity method from our investments in the property funds ii fees and incentives earned for services performed on behalf of the property funds and iii interest earned on advances to the property funds if any the net earnings or losses of the property funds may include the following income and expense items of the property funds in addition to rental income and rental expenses i interest income and interest expense ii depreciation and amortization expenses iii general and administrative expenses iv income tax expense v foreign currency exchange gains and losses and vi gains on dispositions of properties the fluctuations in income we recognize in any given period are generally the result of i variances in the income and expense items of the property funds ii the size of the portfolio and occupancy levels in each period iii changes in our ownership interest and iv fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates at which we translate our share of net earnings to us dollars if applicable the costs of the property management function performed by us for the properties owned by the property funds are reported in the property operations segment and the costs of the investment management function are included in our general and administrative expenses see notes 4 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on the property funds and for a reconciliation of net operating income to earnings before minority interest 

the net operating income from the investment management segment was as follows for the periods indicated in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

cdfs business segment 

 

net operating income from the cdfs business segment consists of i gains resulting from the contributions and dispositions of properties generally developed by us or acquired with the intent to contribute to an existing or new property fund ii gains from the dispositions of land parcels including land subject to ground leases iii fees earned for development services provided to customers and third parties iv interest income earned on notes receivable related to property dispositions or development v our proportionate share of the earnings 

or losses of cdfs joint ventures and vi certain costs associated with the potential acquisition of cdfs business assets and land holding costs see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a reconciliation of net operating income to earnings before minority interest 

 

for 2007 our net operating income in this segment excluding amounts presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements was 7899 million as compared to 3795 million in 2006 an increase of 4104 million or 108 the increased net operating income in this segment was primarily due to increased levels of dispositions brought about by increased development activity the creation of new property funds in europe and north america the mpr acquisition as discussed above and additional gains on the sales of land parcels in 2007 326 of the net operating income of this operating segment was generated in north america 360 was generated in europe and 314 was generated in asia 

 

for 2006 our net operating income in this segment excluding amounts presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements was 3795 million as compared to 2526 million in 2005 an increase of 1269 million or 502 the increased net operating income in this segment in 2006 over 2005 was primarily due to increased levels of dispositions brought about by increased development activity increased earnings from cdfs joint ventures development fees and interest income in 2006 465 of the net operating income of this operating segment was generated in north america 285 was generated in europe and 250 was generated in asia 

 

we attribute the strong performance in 2007 to increased development activity and improved leasing activity for cdfs business properties as well as our ability to create new property funds to acquire our properties we believe the economic conditions in 2007 positively affected our customers’ decisions with respect to changes in their distribution networks increased demand is driven by the need for distribution efficiencies and ongoing growth in global trade our geographically diverse portfolio helps to mitigate the impact of slowing economies in any one area in which we operate there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain or increase the current level of net operating income in this segment see “item 1a risk factors” for factors that may affect our performance in this business segment 

 

the cdfs business segment’s net operating income includes the following components for the periods indicated in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 42 

  

the level and timing of income generated from the cdfs business segment is dependent on several factors including but not limited to i our ability to develop and timely lease properties ii our ability to acquire properties that eventually can be contributed to property funds after rehabilitating or repositioning iii our ability to identify and secure sites for redevelopment iv our ability to generate a profit from these activities and v our success in raising capital to be used by the property funds to acquire the properties we have to contribute the margins earned in this segment may vary quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors including the type of property contributed the market in which the land parcel and property are located and other market conditions there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain or increase the current level of net operating income in this segment overall we believe that the continued demand for stateoftheart distribution properties resulted in positive leasing activity in 2007 in our global development 

pipeline which helps support our cdfs business segment we continue to monitor leasing activity and general economic conditions as it pertains to the cdfs business segment 

 

  

other components of operating income 

 

general and administrative expenses 

 

general and administrative expenses were 2046 million in 2007 1535 million in 2006 and 1182 million in 2005 the increases in general and administrative expenses are due primarily to our continued investment in the infrastructure necessary to support our business growth and continued expansion into new and existing international markets the increase in our investment management business our growing portfolio of properties through acquisitions and development and the growth in our cdfs business segment this increase in infrastructure includes additional headcount and a higher level of performancebased compensation strengthening foreign currencies account for a portion of the increase when our international operations are translated into us dollars at consolidation also in 2007 we recognized 80 million of employee departure costs including 50 million related to the departure of our chief financial officer in march 2007 and 30 million related to employees whose responsibilities became redundant after the acquisition of parkridge in each of 2007 and 2006 we recognized 50 million of expense related to a contribution to our charitable foundation included in 2006 and 2005 are merger integration costs of 26 million and 122 million respectively these costs are indirect costs associated with the catellus merger such as employee transition costs as well as severance costs for certain of our employees whose responsibilities became redundant after the merger 

 

depreciation and amortization 

 

depreciation and amortization expenses were 3090 million in 2007 2868 million in 2006 and 1866 million in 2005 the increases in all periods is due to acquired real estate assets and intangible lease assets improvements made to the properties in our property operations segment and increased leasing activity the increase in 2006 over 2005 is also due to the depreciable assets acquired through the catellus merger 

 

other expenses 

 

during 2007 we recognized an impairment charge of 126 million related to certain properties held and used in our property operations segment 

 

interest expense 

 

interest expense was 3681 million in 2007 2944 million in 2006 and 1776 million in 2005 the increases in interest expense in all periods as compared with the prior year are due to increases in our 

borrowings resulting from individual and portfolio acquisitions including the mpr and parkridge acquisitions in 2007 and the catellus merger in 2005 increased development activity and our increased investments in property funds and cdfs joint ventures offset somewhat by a decrease in our overall weighted average interest rates and additional capitalized interest the decrease in our weighted average interest rates is due to our issuance of debt at lower interest rates including the 24 billion of convertible senior notes issued in 2007 125 billion issued in march 2007 with a coupon rate of 225 and 112 billion issued in november 2007 with a coupon rate of 1875 the increase in capitalized interest for all periods when compared to the prior year is due to our increased development activities see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on our interest expense and debt and note 2 for potential changes in accounting that may impact our reported interest expense 

 

gains recognized on dispositions of certain noncdfs business assets 

 

in 2007 and 2006 we recognized gains of 1467 million and 815 million on the disposition of 77 properties and 39 properties respectively from our property operations segment to certain of the unconsolidated property funds due to our continuing involvement through our ownership in the property funds these dispositions are not included in discontinued operations and the gains recognized represent the portion attributable to the third party ownership in the property funds that acquired the properties 

 

foreign currency exchange gains net 

 

we and certain of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries have intercompany or third party debt that is not denominated in the entity’s functional currency when the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity a gain or loss can result to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate certain of our intercompany debt is remeasured with the resulting adjustment recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders’ equity this treatment is applicable to intercompany debt that is deemed to be longterm in nature if the intercompany debt is deemed shortterm in nature when the debt is remeasured we recognize a gain or loss in earnings additionally we may utilize derivative financial instruments to manage certain foreign currency exchange risks including put option contracts with notional amounts corresponding to a portion of our projected net operating income from our operations in europe and japan and forward contracts designed to manage foreign currency fluctuations of certain intercompany loans see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information on our derivative financial instruments 

 

we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of 79 million 211 million and 160 million during 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively these primarily relate to our third party and intercompany debt transactions and related derivative contracts also included in our 2007 foreign currency exchange gains are several foreign currency forward contracts we purchased to manage the foreign currency fluctuations of the purchase price of mpr which was denominated in australian dollars as contracts used to manage the foreign currency fluctuations of an anticipated business combination do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment the settlement of these contracts in 2007 resulted in net gains of 266 million recognized in earnings 

 

income taxes 

 

during 2007 2006 and 2005 our current income tax expense was 683 million 843 million and 148 million respectively we recognize current income tax expense for income taxes incurred by our taxable reit subsidiaries and in certain foreign jurisdictions primarily related to our cdfs business as well as certain state taxes we also include in current income tax expense the interest associated with our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable cdfs income and changes in tax and interest rates 

 

during 2007 we recognized a deferred tax expense of 06 million compared with a deferred tax benefit of 537 million in 2006 and deferred tax expense of 120 million in 2005 the deferred tax expense in 2007 relates primarily to a tax indemnification agreement we entered into in 2007 in connection with the formation of pepf ii and the indemnification agreement we entered into with pepr in connection with its ipo in 2006 related to the contribution of certain properties all of which were contributed in 2007 these charges were 

partially offset with the benefit we recognized from the termination of the indemnification previously provided to prologis north american properties fund v and other deferred tax benefits due primarily to timing 

 

the deferred tax benefit recognized in 2006 was caused primarily by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with our investments in cdfs joint ventures acquired through the catellus merger as well as the reversal of a deferred tax obligation related to pepr we were previously obligated to the preipo unitholders of pepr under a tax indemnification agreement related to properties we contributed to pepr prior to its ipo based on the average closing price of the ordinary units of pepr during the 30day postipo period we were no longer obligated for indemnification with respect to those properties in the fourth quarter of 2006 and we recognized a deferred tax benefit of 368 million related to the reversal of this obligation the deferred tax expense in 2005 related primarily to the indemnification agreements related to property contributions to pepr and prologis north american properties fund v the current tax indemnification agreements are discussed in more detail in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

discontinued operations 

 

discontinued operations represent a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale if both the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction the results of operations of the component of the entity that has been classified as discontinued operations are reported separately in our consolidated financial statements 

 

during 2007 2006 and 2005 we disposed of 80 89 and 72 cdfs and noncdfs properties respectively as well as land subject to ground leases to third parties the results of operations for these properties as well as the gain recognized upon disposition are included in discontinued operations as of december 31 2007 and 2006 we had two and eight properties respectively classified as held for sale and therefore the results of operations of these properties are also included in discontinued operations 

 

in 2005 we sold our temperaturecontrolled distribution assets in france which resulted in the recognition of 252 million of losses in discontinued operations in 2005 

 

see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further discussion of discontinued operations

liquidity and capital resources 

 

overview 

 

we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities contributions and dispositions of properties and from available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development acquisition operating debt service and shareholder distribution requirements 

 

our credit facilities provide liquidity and financial flexibility which allows us to efficiently respond to market opportunities and execute our business strategy on a global basis regular repayments of our credit facilities are necessary to allow us to maintain adequate liquidity we anticipate future repayments of the borrowings under our credit facilities will be funded primarily through cash flow from operations the proceeds from future property contributions and dispositions and from proceeds generated by future issuances of debt or equity securities depending on market conditions 

 

we continually assess our capital structure and look for ways to reduce our interest expense while financing our growing operations as part of this assessment we access the capital markets through the issuance of debt or equity securities at such time as we believe the market conditions to be favorable to do so 

this may include refinancing of maturing indebtedness including borrowings on credit facilities that were used to fund acquisitions and development due to the recent turmoil in the credit markets we may not be able to finance maturing debt on terms that are as favorable as the terms on the maturing debt as a part of our cdfs business strategy we are able to fund much of our ongoing development and acquisition costs with the proceeds from the contribution and or disposition of properties this strategy makes us less dependent on accessing the capital markets although the property funds that primarily acquire our properties may also be affected by the current condition of the credit markets in 2008 we have scheduled principle payments of 964 million of debt including maturing debt we expect to repay these amounts with the issuance of unsecured debt under our current indenture or with borrowings under our existing credit facilities as discussed below 

 

our credit facilities provide aggregate borrowing capacity of 37 billion at december 31 2007 this includes our global line where a syndicate of 38 banks allows us to draw funds in us dollar euro japanese yen british pound sterling chinese renminbi south korean won and canadian dollar the total commitment under the global line fluctuates in us dollars based on the underlying currencies based on our public debt ratings interest on the borrowings under the global line primarily accrues at a variable rate based upon the interbank offered rate in each respective jurisdiction in which the borrowings are outstanding the majority of the global line matures in october 2009 however it contains provisions for an extension at our option subject to certain conditions to october 2010 the renminbi tranche accrues interest based upon the people’s bank of china rate and matures in may 2009 as of december 31 2007 under these facilities we had outstanding borrowings of 20 billion and 1482 million of letters of credit outstanding with participating lenders resulting in remaining borrowing capacity of 16 billion 

 

in february 2007 in connection with the parkridge acquisition as discussed earlier we entered into a new multicurrency senior credit facility the total commitment under this facility fluctuates in us dollars based on the underlying currencies and the funds may be drawn in us dollar euro japanese yen and british pound sterling borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based upon the interbank offered rate in each respective jurisdiction in which the borrowings are outstanding plus a margin and the facility matures in october 2009 this debt can be repaid at our option prior to maturity the facility provides us the ability to reborrow within a specified period of time any amounts repaid on the facility as of december 31 2007 the outstanding balance was 6266 million and is included in senior notes and other unsecured debt and we had no available capacity to borrow additional funds under this facility 

 

during 2007 we issued 24 billion of convertible senior notes in march we issued 125 billion with a coupon rate of 225 due in march 2037 and in november we issued 112 billion with a coupon rate of 1875 due in november 2037 the proceeds of these issuances were used to pay down borrowings under our lines of credit and other debt and for general corporate purposes the convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations of prologis and are convertible under certain circumstances for cash our common shares or a combination of cash and our common shares at our option at a specified conversion price the initial conversion price represents a premium of 20 over the closing price of our common shares at the date of first sale the notes are redeemable at our option after five years for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and at any time prior to maturity to the extent necessary to preserve our status as a reit holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes every five years beginning after the first five years and at any time prior to their maturity upon certain limited circumstances 

 

in addition to common share distributions and preferred share dividend requirements we expect our primary short and longterm cash needs will consist of the following for 2008 and future years 

 

 47 

 

  

we expect to fund cash needs for 2008 and future years primarily with cash from the following sources all subject to market conditions 

 

  

commitments related to future contributions to property funds 

 

we are committed to offer to contribute substantially all of the properties we develop and stabilize in canada and the united states to the north american industrial fund the north american industrial fund has equity commitments which expire in february 2009 aggregating approximately 14 billion from third party investors of which 7297 million was unfunded at december 31 2007 in addition we are committed to make additional capital contributions in cash of 255 million through february 2009 as the fund acquires assets primarily from us this capital contribution represents our three percent ownership interest in the north american industrial fund that we acquired in july 2007 as part of the mpr acquisition 

 

we are committed to offer to contribute all of the properties we develop and stabilize in mexico and in certain circumstances properties we acquire to prologis mexico industrial fund prologis mexico industrial fund has equity commitments which expire in august 2010 aggregating approximately 5000 million from third party investors of which 4115 million was unfunded at december 31 2007 

 

we are committed to offer to contribute substantially all of the properties we develop and stabilize in europe and in certain circumstances properties we acquire to pepf ii pepf ii has equity commitments which expire in august 2010 aggregating approximately €25 billion 36 billion as of december 31 2007 from third party investors and pepr of which €21 billion 31 billion as of december 31 2007 was unfunded at december 31 2007 

 

we are committed to offer to contribute all of the properties we develop and stabilize in japan to prologis japan properties fund ii through september 2010 prologis japan properties fund ii has an equity commitment of 6000 million from our fund partner which expires in august 2008 and under which 282 million was unfunded at december 31 2007 in february 2008 prologis japan properties fund ii received an additional equity commitment of 4000 million from our fund partner that expires in september 2010 

 

we are committed to offer to contribute substantially all of the properties we develop and stabilize in south korea and in certain circumstances properties we acquire to prologis korea fund prologis korea fund has an equity commitment from our fund partner of 2000 million which expires in june 2010 and under which 1794 million was unfunded at december 31 2007 

 

these property funds are committed to acquire such properties subject to certain exceptions including that the properties meet certain specified leasing and other criteria and that the property funds have available 

capital we believe that while the current capital commitments and borrowing capacities of these property funds may be expended prior to the expiration dates of these commitments each property fund will have sufficient debt andor equity capital to acquire the properties that we expect to offer to contribute during 2008 however there can be no certainty until the contributions are completed should the property funds not acquire because of insufficient capital available to acquire a property that meets the specified criteria or other reason the rights under the agreement with regard to that specific property will terminate we continually explore our options related to both new and existing property funds to support the business objectives of our cdfs business segment 

 

there can be no assurance that if these property funds do not acquire the properties we have available we will be able to secure other sources of capital such that we can contribute or sell these properties in a timely manner and continue to generate profits from our development activities in a particular reporting period 

 

in addition to the extent a property fund acquires properties from a third party we may be required to contribute our proportionate share of the equity component in cash to the property fund 

 

cash provided by operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 12 billion for 2007 6873 million for 2006 and 4881 million for 2005 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2007 over 2006 is due primarily to higher cdfs gains on contributions of properties to the property funds in 2007 adjusted for noncash items operational items that impact net cash provided by operating activities are more fully discussed in “ results of operations” cash provided by operating activities exceeded the cash distributions paid on common shares and dividends paid on preferred shares in all periods 

 

cash investing and cash financing activities 

 

for 2007 2006 and 2005 investing activities used net cash of 41 billion 21 billion and 22 billion respectively the following are the more significant activities for all periods presented 

 

 49 

  

  

for 2007 2006 and 2005 financing activities provided net cash of 27 billion 16 billion and 17 billion respectively the following are the more significant activities for all periods presented as summarized below

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

liquidity and capital resources of our unconsolidated investees 

 

we had investments in and advances to unconsolidated investees of 23 billion at december 31 2007 of which 18 billion relates to our investments in the property funds summarized financial information for the property funds for the entire entity not our proportionate share at december 31 2007 is presented below dollars in millions 

 

 

 

  

see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on the property funds and derivative contracts related to this debt 

contractual obligations 

 

longterm contractual obligations 

 

we had longterm contractual obligations at december 31 2007 related to longterm debt senior and other unsecured debt secured debt and assessment bonds unfunded commitments on development projects acquisitions and capital to unconsolidated investees and amounts due on lines of credit as follows in millions 

 

 

 

  

other commitments 

 

from time to time we enter into special limited contribution agreements “slcas” in connection with certain of our contributions of properties to property funds the potential obligations under the slcas aggregate 12 billion at december 31 2007 and the combined book value of the assets in the property funds before depreciation that are subject to the provisions of slcas was approximately 63 billion at december 31 2007 see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

as of december 31 2007 we have advanced 1158 million to two of our cdfs joint ventures to fund development activities and one of the joint ventures may borrow an additional £75 million or 151 million 

 

distribution and dividend requirements 

 

our common share distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure we will meet the distribution requirements of the code relative to maintaining our reit status while still allowing us to maximize the cash retained to meet other cash needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities because depreciation is a noncash expense cash flow typically will be greater than operating income and net earnings 

 

cash distributions per common share paid in 2007 2006 and 2005 were 184 160 and 148 respectively in december 2007 the board approved an increase in the annual distribution for 2008 from 184 to 207 per common share the payment of common share distributions is dependent upon our financial condition and operating results and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year a distribution of 05175 per common share for the first quarter of 2008 was declared on february 1 2008 this distribution will be paid on february 29 2008 to holders of common shares on february 15 2008 we have increased our common share distribution level every year since our common shares became publicly traded in 1994 

at december 31 2007 we had three series of preferred shares outstanding the annual dividend rates on preferred shares are 427 per series c preferred share 169 per series f preferred share and 169 per series g preferred share 

 

pursuant to the terms of our preferred shares we are restricted from declaring or paying any distribution with respect to our common shares unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred shares have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the then current dividend period with respect to the preferred shares 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

funds from operations 

 

ffo is a nongaap measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings although nareit has published a definition of ffo modifications to the nareit calculation of ffo are common among reits as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business ffo as we define it is presented as a supplemental financial measure we do not use ffo as nor should it be considered to be an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of our ability to fund our cash needs 

 

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor do we intend it to present a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance we believe net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap further we believe our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition and our operating performance 

 

nareit’s ffo measure adjusts net earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated properties we agree that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

a historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes through depreciation charges that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time nareit stated in its white paper on ffo “since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves” consequently nareit’s definition of ffo reflects the fact that real estate as an asset class generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by gaap do not reflect the underlying economic realities 

 

b reits were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of longterm ownership and management of real estate the exclusion in nareit’s definition of ffo of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the longterm assets that form the core of a reit’s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods we include the gains and losses from dispositions of properties acquired or developed in our cdfs business segment and our proportionate share of the gains and losses from dispositions recognized by the property funds in our definition of ffo 

 

at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo concept for the reit industry it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community” we believe financial analysts potential investors and shareholders who review our operating results are best served by a defined ffo measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of ffo 

our defined ffo measure excludes the following items from net earnings computed under gaap that are not excluded in the nareit defined ffo measure 

 

  

ffo of our unconsolidated investees is calculated on the same basis 

 

the items that we exclude from net earnings computed under gaap while not infrequent or unusual are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions most importantly the economics underlying the items that we exclude from net earnings computed under gaap are not the primary drivers in management’s decisionmaking process and capital investment decisions period to period fluctuations in these items can be driven by accounting for shortterm factors that are not relevant to longterm investment decisions longterm capital structures or longterm tax planning and tax structuring decisions accordingly we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy 

 

real estate is a capitalintensive business investors’ analyses of the performance of real estate companies tend to be centered on understanding the asset value created by real estate investment decisions and understanding current operating returns that are being generated by those same investment decisions the adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap that are included in arriving at our ffo measure are helpful to management in making real estate investment decisions and evaluating our current operating performance we believe these adjustments are also helpful to industry analysts potential investors and shareholders in their understanding and evaluation of our performance on the key measures of net asset value and current operating returns generated on real estate investments 

 

while we believe our defined ffo measure is an important supplemental measure neither nareit’s nor our measure of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are therefore limited as an analytical tool some of these limitations are 

 

 54 

 

  

we compensate for these limitations by using the ffo measure only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap to further compensate we reconcile our defined ffo measure to net earnings computed under gaap in our financial reports additionally we provide investors with i our complete financial statements prepared under gaap ii our definition of ffo which includes a discussion of the limitations of using our nongaap measure and iii a reconciliation of our gaap measure net earnings to our nongaap measure ffo as we define it so that investors can appropriately incorporate this measure and its limitations into their analyses 

 

ffo attributable to common shares as defined by us was 12270 million 9451 million and 5305 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the reconciliations of net earnings attributable to common shares computed under gaap to ffo attributable to common shares as defined by us are as follows for the periods indicated in thousands

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreignexchange related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments we have used certain derivative financial instruments primarily foreign currency put option and forward contracts to reduce our foreign currency market risk we have also used interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate market risk we do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with established polices and procedures 

 

we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in year end interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value as a result our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to achieve this objective we primarily borrow on a fixed rate basis for longerterm debt issuances in anticipation of financings expected to occur in 2007 we entered into several interest rate swap contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges to fix the interest rate on a portion of the expected financing we had no interest rate derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2007 

 

our primary interest rate risk is created by the variable rate lines of credit during the year ended december 31 2007 we had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of 25 billion on our variable rate lines of credit based on the results of the sensitivity analysis which assumed a 10 adverse change in interest rates the estimated market risk exposure for the variable rate lines of credit was approximately 87 million of cash flow for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

we also have 11 billion of variable interest rate debt in which we have a market risk of increased rates based on a sensitivity analysis with a 10 adverse change in interest rates our estimated market risk exposure for this issuance is approximately 55 million on our cash flow for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

the unconsolidated property funds that we manage and in which we have an equity ownership may enter into interest rate swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate interest expense volatility associated with movements of interest rates for the debt they expect to issue in 2007 certain of the property funds issued shortterm bridge financing to finance their acquisitions of properties from us and third parties based on the anticipated refinancing of these bridge financings with longerterm debt issuances the property funds have the following interest rate swap contracts outstanding at december 31 2007 amounts are for the entire entity and dollars are in thousands 

 

 

 

we have recorded our proportionate share of the liabilities of the funds related to these instruments in other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity once these contracts are settled the amount of the gain or loss upon settlement which is recorded by the property funds in other comprehensive income will be amortized over the life of the hedged debt issuance we guarantee our proportionate share of the prologis north american industrial fund iii contracts see also item 1a for risk factors related to financing 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates to the translation of the forecasted net income of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars principally euro pound sterling yen and renminbi to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate we also may use foreign currency put option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the projected net operating income of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees at december 31 2007 we had no put option contracts outstanding for the year ended december 31 2007 approximately 42 of our revenues were generated outside of the united states 

 

we also have some exposure to movements in exchange rates related to certain intercompany loans we issue from time to time and we may use foreign currency forward contracts to manage these risks at december 31 2007 we had forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of £1815 million 3607 million at december 31 2007

 item 1   business tableend  

general 

 

amb property corporation a maryland corporation acquires develops and operates industrial properties in key distribution markets throughout north america europe and asia we use the terms “industrial properties” or “industrial buildings” to describe various types of industrial properties in our portfolio and use these terms interchangeably with the following logistics facilities centers or warehouses distribution facilities centers or warehouses high throughput distribution ® htd ®  facilities or any combination of these terms we use the term “owned and managed” to describe assets in which we have at least a 10 ownership interest for which we are the property or asset manager and which we intend to hold for the longterm 

 

we commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on november 26 1997 our strategy focuses on providing properties for customers who value the efficient movement of goods located mostly in the world’s busiest distribution markets large supplyconstrained locations with proximity to airports seaports and major highway systems as of december 31 2006 we owned or had investments in on a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint ventures properties and development projects expected to total approximately 1247 million square feet 116 million square meters and 1088 buildings in 39 markets within twelve countries additionally as of december 31 2006 we managed but did not have a significant ownership interest in industrial and other properties totaling approximately 15 million rentable square feet 

 

we operate our business primarily through our subsidiary amb property lp a delaware limited partnership which we refer to as the “operating partnership” as of december 31 2006 we owned an approximate 950 general partnership interest in the operating partnership excluding preferred units as the sole general partner of the operating partnership we have the full exclusive and complete responsibility for and discretion in its daytoday management and control 

 

our investment strategy generally targets customers whose businesses are tied to global trade which according to the world trade organization has grown two to three times the world gross domestic product growth rate during the last 20 years to serve the facility needs of these customers we seek to invest globally in major distribution markets transportation hubs and gateways that generally are tied to global trade 

 

our strategy is to be a leading provider of industrial properties in supplyconstrained submarkets of our targets markets these submarkets are generally characterized by large population densities and typically offer substantial consumer concentrations proximity to large clusters of distributionfacility users and significant labor pools and are generally located near key international passenger and cargo airports seaports and major highway systems when measured by annualized base rent on an owned and managed basis 996 of our portfolio of industrial properties is located in our target markets and much of this is in infill submarkets within our target markets infill locations are characterized by supply constraints on the availability of land for competing projects as well as physical political or economic barriers to new development 

 

further in many of our target markets we focus on htd ® facilities which are buildings designed to facilitate the rapid distribution of our customers’ products rather than storage of goods our investment focus on htd ® assets is based on what we believe to be a global trend toward lower inventory levels and expedited supply chains htd ® facilities generally have a variety of physical characteristics that allow for the rapid transport of goods from pointtopoint these physical characteristics could include numerous dock doors shallower building depths fewer columns large truck courts and more space for trailer parking we believe that these building characteristics represent an important success factor for timesensitive customers such as air express logistics and freight forwarding companies and that these facilities function best when located in convenient proximity to transportation infrastructure such as major airports and seaports 

   

of the approximately 1247 million rentable square feet as of december 31 2006 

 

  

during 2006 our property acquisitions on an owned and managed basis totaled 8342 million including expected capital expenditures and acquisitions by amb institutional alliance fund iii an unconsolidated joint venture totaling 5400 million primarily located in our target countries that included france germany mexico the netherlands and the us as of december 31 2006 we had four industrial projects held for divestiture dispositions during 2006 totaled 3351 million including dispositions by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures of 1598 million assets were divested in markets that no longer fit our investment strategy such as charlotte cincinnati and memphis and we also disposed of properties at valuation levels that we considered to be premium while we continue to sell assets we believe that we have achieved our nearterm strategic disposition goals additionally we contributed 6073 million of completed development projects and a land parcel for 775 million to our private capital joint ventures as part of our continuing strategy to increase the proportion of our assets owned in coinvestment joint ventures 

 

we are selfadministered and selfmanaged and expect that we have qualified and will continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended december 31 1997 as a selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust our own employees perform our corporate administrative and management functions rather than our relying on an outside manager for these services we manage our portfolio of properties in a flexible operating model which includes both direct property management and a strategic alliance program ® in which we have established relationships with thirdparty real estate management firms brokers and developers that provide propertylevel administrative and management services under our direction

operating strategy 

 

we base our operating strategy on a variety of operational and service offerings including inhouse acquisitions development redevelopment asset management property management leasing finance accounting and market research our strategy is to leverage our expertise across a large customer base and complement our internal management resources with longstanding relationships with entrepreneurial real estate management and development firms in certain of our target markets 

 

we believe that real estate is fundamentally a local business and best operated by local teams in each market comprised of amb employees local alliance partners or both we intend to continue to increase utilization of internal management resources in target markets to achieve both operating efficiencies and to expose our customers to the broadening array of amb service offerings including access to multiple locations worldwide and buildtosuit developments we actively manage our portfolio whether directly or with an alliance partner by establishing leasing strategies negotiating lease terms pricing and level and timing of property improvements 

 

growth strategies 

 

growth through operations 

 

we seek to generate longterm internal growth through rent increases on existing space and renewals on rollover space by working to maintain a high occupancy rate at our properties and to control expenses by capitalizing on the economies of scale inherent in owning operating and growing a large global portfolio during 2006 our average industrial property base rental rates decreased by 01 from the rent in place at expiration for that space on leases entered into or renewed during the period this amount excludes expense reimbursements rental abatements percentage rents and straightline rents during 2006 cash basis same store net operating income rental revenues less property operating expenses and real estate taxes for properties included in the same store pool which is set annually and excludes properties purchased or developments stabilized after december 31 2004 increased by 26 on our industrial properties since our initial public offering in november 1997 on a consolidated basis we have experienced average annual increases in industrial property base rental rates of 44 and maintained an average quarterend occupancy rate of 950 in our industrial property operating portfolio while we believe that it is important to view real estate as a longterm investment past results are not necessarily an indication of future performance see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — supplemental earnings measures” for a discussion of same store net operating income and a reconciliation of same store net operating income and net income and part iv item 15 note 16 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for detailed segment information including revenue attributable to each segment gross investment in each segment and total assets 

 

growth through development and valueadded conversions 

 

we believe that development redevelopment and expansion of welllocated highquality industrial properties should continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain 

  from the purchase of existing properties we believe we have the inhouse expertise to create value both through new construction and acquisition and management of valueadded properties valueadded conversion projects represent the development of land or a building site for a more valuable use and may include such activities as rezoning redesigning reconstructing and retenanting both new development and valueadded conversions require significant management attention and capital investment to maximize their return completed development properties are generally contributed to our coinvestment joint ventures and held in our owned and managed portfolio or sold to third parties we believe our global market presence and expertise will enable us to continue to generate and capitalize on a diverse range of development opportunities 

 

we believe that the multidisciplinary backgrounds of our employees should provide us with the skills and experience to capitalize on strategic renovation expansion and development opportunities many of our officers have specific experience in real estate development both with us and with national development firms and over the past four years we have significantly expanded our development staff we pursue development projects directly and in joint ventures providing us with the flexibility to pursue development projects independently or in partnerships depending on market conditions submarkets or building sites 

 

growth through acquisitions and capital redeployment 

 

we believe that our acquisition experience and our network of property management leasing and acquisition resources will continue to provide opportunities for growth in addition to our internal resources we have longterm relationships with thirdparty local property management firms which we believe may give us access to additional acquisition opportunities as such managers frequently market properties on behalf of sellers we believe also that our upreit structure which enables us to acquire land and industrial properties in exchange for limited partnership units in the operating partnership or amb property ii lp another of our operating partnerships enhances our attractiveness to owners and developers seeking to transfer properties on a taxdeferred basis in addition we seek to redeploy capital from nonstrategic assets into properties that better fit our current investment focus 

 

we are generally engaged in various stages of negotiations for a number of acquisitions and dispositions that may include acquisitions and dispositions of individual properties large multiproperty portfolios or other real estate companies we cannot assure you that we will consummate any of these transactions such transactions if we consummate them may be material individually or in the aggregate sources of capital for acquisitions may include retained cash flow from operations borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities other forms of secured or unsecured debt financing issuances of debt or preferred or common equity securities by us or the operating partnership including issuances of units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries proceeds from divestitures of properties assumption of debt related to the acquired properties and private capital from our coinvestment partners see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — summary of key transactions in 2006” 

 

growth through global expansion 

 

by the end of 2010 we expect to have approximately 50 of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in nonus markets based on annualized base rent as of december 31 2006 our nonus operating properties comprised 141 of our owned and managed operating portfolio based on annualized base rent and 74 of our consolidated operating portfolio based on annualized base rent our north american target countries outside of the united states currently comprise canada and mexico our european target countries currently comprise belgium france germany italy the netherlands spain and the united kingdom our asian target countries currently comprise china india japan singapore and south korea we expect to add additional target countries outside the united states in the future 

 

we believe that expansion into target markets outside the us represents a natural extension of our strategy to invest in industrial property markets with high population densities close proximity to large customer clusters and available labor pools and major distribution centers serving global trade our international expansion strategy mirrors our focus in the united states on supplyconstrained submarkets with political economic or physical constraints to new development our international investments extend our offering of htd ® facilities for customers 

  who value speedtomarket over storage specifically we are focused on customers whose business is derived from global trade in addition our investments target major consumer distribution markets and customers we believe that our established customer relationships our contacts in the air cargo and logistics industries our underwriting of markets and investments and our strategic alliances with knowledgeable developers and managers will assist us in competing internationally 

 

there are many factors that could cause our entry into target markets and future capital allocation to differ from our current expectations which are discussed in this report under the heading “business risks — risks associated with our international business” further it is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience market opportunities customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns for a discussion of the amount of our revenues attributable to the united states and international markets please see part iv item 15 note 16 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

 

growth through coinvestments 

 

we coinvest in properties with privatecapital investors through partnerships limited liability companies or joint ventures our coinvestment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and typically operate under the same investment strategy that we apply to our other operations typically we will own a 1550 interest in our coinvestment joint ventures we believe that our coinvestment program will continue to serve as a source of capital for acquisitions and developments however we cannot assure you that it will continue to do so in addition our coinvestment joint ventures typically allow us to earn acquisition and development fees asset management fees or priority distributions as well as promoted interests or incentive distributions based on the performance of the coinvestment joint ventures as of december 31 2006 we owned approximately 643 million square feet of our properties 516 of the total operating and development portfolio through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

business risks 

 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to us these risks include among others 

 

general real estate industry risks 

 

our performance and value are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets 

 

the investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the properties as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties if our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures then our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected in addition there are significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate such as mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs that generally do not decline when circumstances reduce the income from the property income from and the value of our properties may be adversely affected by 

 

 8 

   

  

in addition periods of economic slowdown or recession in the united states and in other countries rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate or public perception that any of these events may occur would result in a general decrease in rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations future terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity which could reduce the demand for and the value of our properties to the extent that future attacks impact our customers their businesses similarly could be adversely affected including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases 

 

our properties are concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector as a result of this concentration we would feel the impact of an economic downturn in this sector more acutely than if our portfolio included other property types 

 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire 

 

as of december 31 2006 leases on a total of 143 of our industrial properties based on annualized base rent will expire on or prior to december 31 2007 we derive most of our income from rent received from our customers accordingly our financial condition results of operations cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew these expiring leases or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected if a customer experiences a downturn in its business or other type of financial distress then it may be unable to make timely rental payments or renew its lease further our ability to rent space and the rents that we can charge are impacted not only by customer demand but by the number of other properties we have to compete with to appeal to customers 

 

actions by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental rates of our properties 

 

we compete with other developers owners and operators of real estate some of which own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located if our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers we may lose potential customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain customers when our customers’ leases expire as a result our financial condition cash flow cash available for distribution trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected 

 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid making it difficult for us to respond promptly to changing conditions 

 

real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of assets further the internal revenue code regulates the number of properties that we as a real estate investment trust can dispose of in a year their tax bases and the cost of improvements that we make to the properties in addition a portion of the properties held directly or indirectly by certain of our subsidiary partnerships were acquired in exchange for limited partnership units in the applicable partnership the contribution agreements for such properties may contain restrictions on certain sales exchanges or other dispositions of these properties or a portion thereof that result in a taxable transaction for specified periods following the contribution of these properties to the applicable partnership these limitations may affect our ability to sell properties this lack of liquidity and the internal revenue code restrictions may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and as a result could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

   

we could be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers are unable to meet their lease obligations 

 

our results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of our stock would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations to us in the event of a significant number of lease defaults our cash flow may not be sufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders and repay maturing debt as of december 31 2006 we did not have any single customer account for annualized base rent revenues greater than 31 however in the event of lease defaults by a significant number of our customers we may incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord 

 

we may be unable to consummate acquisitions on advantageous terms or acquisitions may not perform as we expect 

 

we acquire and intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties the acquisition of properties entails various risks including the risks that our investments may not perform as we expect that we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate our new acquisitions into our existing operations and that our cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate further we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other wellcapitalized real estate investors including both publiclytraded real estate investment trusts and private institutional investment funds this competition increases as investments in real estate become increasingly attractive relative to other forms of investment as a result of competition we may be unable to acquire additional properties as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly elevated in addition we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership or its subsidiaries and proceeds from property divestitures which may not be available and which could adversely affect our cash flow any of the above risks could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

 

we may be unable to complete renovation and development projects on advantageous terms 

 

as part of our business we develop new and renovate existing properties and we intend to continue to expand and increase our investment in our development and renovation business the real estate development and renovation business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock which include the following risks 

 

  

risks associated with our international business 

 

our international growth is subject to special risks and we may not be able to effectively manage our international growth 

 

we have acquired and developed and expect to continue to acquire and develop properties outside the united states because local markets affect our operations our international investments are subject to economic 

  fluctuations in the international locations in which we invest in addition our international operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations including those governing the taxation of our international revenues restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world uncertainty over property rights and political instability we cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur further we have entered and may in the future enter into agreements with nonus entities that are governed by the laws of and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of another country or region we cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise and even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis or at all 

 

we also have offices in many countries outside the united states and as a result our operations may be subject to risks that may limit our ability to effectively establish staff and manage our offices outside the united states including 

 

  

our global growth including growth in new regions in the us subjects us to certain risks including risks associated with funding increasing headcount integrating new offices and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices in addition payroll expenses are paid in local currencies and therefore we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and these currencies 

 

further our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through international property acquisitions and developments if we fail to effectively manage our international growth then our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected 

 

acquired properties may be located in new markets where we may face risks associated with investing in an unfamiliar market 

 

we have acquired and may continue to acquire properties in international markets that are new to us when we acquire properties located in these markets we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures we work to mitigate such risks through extensive diligence and research and associations with experienced partners however there can be no guarantee that all such risks will be eliminated 

 

we are subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we invest 

 

we are pursuing and intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets as we invest in countries where the us dollar is not the national currency we are subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the currencies of those other countries a significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations we attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing under our multicurrency credit facility in the currency of the country we are investing in and under certain circumstances by putting in place international currency put option contracts to hedge exchange rate fluctuations for leases denominated in international currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international currency exchange risk we cannot however assure you that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks if we do engage in international currency exchange rate hedging activities any income recognized with respect to these hedges as well as any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in 

  exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust 

 

general business risks 

 

our performance and value are impacted by the local economic conditions of and the risks associated with doing business in california 

 

as of december 31 2006 our industrial properties located in california represented 253 of the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating properties and 254 of our industrial annualized base rent on an owned and managed basis our revenue from and the value of our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california’s economic climate because of the number of properties we have located in california a downturn in california’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

 

we may experience losses that our insurance does not cover 

 

we carry commercial liability property and rental loss insurance covering all the properties that we own and manage in types and amounts that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risks applicable to the property the cost of coverage and industry practice certain losses such as those due to terrorism windstorms floods or seismic activity may be insured subject to certain limitations including large deductibles or copayments and policy limits although we have obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism with policy specifications and insured limits that we consider commercially reasonable given the cost and availability of such coverage we cannot be certain that we will be able to renew coverage on comparable terms or collect under such policies in addition there are other types of losses such as those from riots bioterrorism or acts of war that are not generally insured in our industry because it is not economically feasible to do so we may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds our insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and if there is recourse debt then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties moreover as the general partner of the operating partnership we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnership’s unsatisfied recourse obligations including any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of coinvestment joint ventures any such losses could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

 

a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity us properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the san francisco bay area los angeles and seattle our largest concentration of such properties is in california where on an owned and managed basis as of december 31 2006 we had 267 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 255 million square feet and representing 253 of our industrial operating properties based on aggregate square footage and 254 based on industrial annualized base rent on an owned and managed basis international properties located in active seismic areas include tokyo and osaka japan and mexico city mexico we carry earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants 

 

a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane andor flood risk we carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants in 2005 various properties that we own or lease in new orleans louisiana and south florida suffered damage as a result of hurricanes katrina and wilma although we expect that our insurance will cover losses 

  arising from this damage in excess of the deductibles paid by us and do not believe that such losses would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results from operations we cannot assure you that we will be reimbursed for all losses incurred 

 

we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties owned through joint ventures limited liability companies and partnerships 

 

as of december 31 2006 we owned approximately 643 million square feet of our properties through several joint ventures limited liability companies or partnerships with third parties our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships limited liability companies or joint ventures and we intend to continue to develop and acquire properties through joint ventures limited liability companies and partnerships with other persons or entities when warranted by the circumstances such partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions partnership limited liability company or joint venture investments involve certain risks including 

 

  

we generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships limited liability companies and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives however we may not be able to do so and the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

 

we may be unable to complete divestitures on advantageous terms or contribute properties 

 

we intend to continue to divest ourselves of properties that do not meet our strategic objectives provided that we can negotiate acceptable terms and conditions our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors beyond our control including competition from other sellers and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of our properties if we are unable to dispose of properties on favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy then our financial 

  condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected 

 

we also anticipate contributing or selling properties to funds and joint ventures if the funds are unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms after currently available capital is depleted or if the value of such properties are appraised at less than the cost of such properties then such contributions or sales could be delayed or prevented adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock for example although we have acquired land for development and made capital commitments in japan and mexico we cannot be assured that we ultimately will be able to contribute such properties to funds or joint ventures as we have planned 

 

contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 

 

we have acquired and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties then we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it which could adversely affect our cash flow contingent or unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include 

 

  

we are dependent on external sources of capital 

 

in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our real estate investment trust taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain and are taxed on our income to the extent it is not fully distributed consequently we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and must rely on thirdparty sources of capital further in order to maintain our real estate investment trust status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the real estate investment trust distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments our ability to access private debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our capital stock 

 

debt financing risks 

 

we could incur more debt increasing our debt service 

 

it is our policy to incur debt either directly or through our subsidiaries only if it will not cause our share of total debttoour share of total market capitalization ratio to exceed approximately 45 our definition of “our share of total market capitalization” is our share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity see footnote 1 to the capitalization ratios table contained in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation — liquidity and capital resources” for our definitions of “market equity” and “our share of total debt” the aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy increases directly with an increase in the market price per share of our capital stock further our management could alter or eliminate this policy without stockholder approval if we change this policy then we 

  could become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders 

 

we face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments including refinancing risk 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had total debt outstanding of 34 billion we guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest we anticipate that we will repay only a small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity accordingly we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt if we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase 

 

in addition if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value a foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

 

covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition 

 

the terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of financial and other covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit flexibility in our operations and our failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied our payment obligations as of december 31 2006 we had certain nonrecourse secured loans which are crosscollateralized by multiple properties if we default on any of these loans we may then be required to repay such indebtedness together with applicable prepayment charges to avoid foreclosure on all the crosscollateralized properties within the applicable pool foreclosure on our properties or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock in addition our credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain crossdefault provisions which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default these crossdefault provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations 

 

we seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements these agreements involve risks such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations 

   

conflicts of interest risks 

 

some of our directors and executive officers are involved in other real estate activities and investments and therefore may have conflicts of interest with us 

 

from time to time certain of our executive officers and directors may own interests in other realestate related businesses and investments including de minimis holdings of the equity securities of public and private real estate companies our executive officers’ involvement in other real estaterelated activities could divert their attention from our daytoday operations our executive officers have entered into noncompetition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities directly or indirectly in respect of commercial real estate and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate other than through ownership of not more than 5 of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through certain specified investments state law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements we will not acquire any properties from our executive officers directors or their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and independent as defined by the rules of the new york stock exchange members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction 

 

our role as general partner of the operating partnership may conflict with the interests of our stockholders 

 

as the general partner of the operating partnership we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnership’s limited partners the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders in addition those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the operating partnership’s partnership agreement and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights the limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders in addition under the terms of the operating partnership’s partnership agreement holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders 

 

risks associated with government regulations 

 

the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and any related potential liability could exceed our budgets for these items 

 

under various environmental laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at on under or in its property the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial these laws typically impose liability and cleanup responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination 

 

environmental laws in some countries including the us also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of our properties may contain asbestoscontaining building materials 

 

in addition some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances further certain of our properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic 

  substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in such an instance we underwrite the costs of environmental investigation cleanup and monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate environmental insurance for the property further in connection with certain divested properties we have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties 

 

at the time of acquisition we subject all of our properties to a phase i or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants and we may have additional phase ii testing performed upon the consultant’s recommendation these environmental assessments have not revealed and we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole nonetheless it is possible that the assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities unknown to us or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are greater than we anticipated further our properties’ current environmental condition may be affected by customers the condition of land operations in the vicinity of the properties such as releases from underground storage tanks or by unrelated third parties if the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items then our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected 

 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs 

 

under the americans with disabilities act places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants if we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the americans with disabilities act including removing access barriers then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected our properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and lifesafety requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements while we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

 

federal income tax risks 

 

our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have serious adverse consequences to our stockholders 

 

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “internal revenue code” commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1997 we currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust however it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control for example in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust we must derive at least 95 of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our real estate investment trust taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy 

  specified asset tests on a quarterly basis these provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification however we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust 

 

if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year then we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost qualification if we lose our real estate investment trust status then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders 

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction 

 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties including the contribution of properties to our joint venture funds under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our joint venture funds are properly treated as prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us or contributions of properties into our joint venture funds are prohibited transactions while we believe that the internal revenue service would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes 

 

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel 

 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees from time to time our personnel and their roles may change while we believe that we could find suitable employees to meet our personnel needs the loss of key personnel any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

 

because our compensation packages include equitybased incentives pressure on our stock price or limitations on our ability to award such incentives could affect our ability to offer competitive compensation packages to our executives and key employees if we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected 

 

risks associated with our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

 

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 

 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

  there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations restatements of our financial statements a decline in our stock price or otherwise materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

 

risks associated with ownership of our stock 

 

limitations in our charter and bylaws could prevent a change in control 

 

certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay defer or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for the common stock to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made furthermore our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12month taxable year or a proportionate part of a short tax year in addition if we or an owner of 10 or more of our stock actually or constructively owns 10 or more of one of our customers or a customer of any partnership in which we are a partner then the rent received by us either directly or through any such partnership from that customer will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the internal revenue code to help us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes we prohibit the ownership actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the internal revenue code by any single person of more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our common stock series l preferred stock series m preferred stock series o preferred stock and series p preferred stock we also prohibit the ownership actually or constructively of any shares of our series d i j and k preferred stock by any single person so that no such person taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person including any common stock or other series of preferred stock may own in excess of 98 of our issued and outstanding capital stock we refer to this limitation as the “ownership limit” shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale a transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances the ownership limit may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction 

 

our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction including a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

 

our charter and bylaws and maryland law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors which in turn may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control those provisions in our charter and bylaws include 

 

 19 

   

  

those provisions provided for under maryland law include 

 

  

in addition our board could elect to adopt without stockholder approval certain other provisions under maryland law that may impede a change in control 

 

the market value of our stock could be substantially affected by various factors 

 

as with other publicly traded securities the trading price of our stock will depend on many factors that are not within our control and may change from time to time including 

 

  

other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future trading price of our stock 

 

if we issue additional securities then the investment of existing stockholders will be diluted 

 

as a real estate investment trust we are dependent on external sources of capital and may issue common or preferred stock or debt securities to fund our future capital needs we have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities and to cause the operating partnership or amb property ii lp to issue limited partnership units in exchange for property or otherwise existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by the operating partnership amb property ii lp or us and any issuance of additional equity securities may adversely effect the market price of our stock and could result in dilution of an existing stockholder’s investment 

 

earnings cash dividends asset value and market interest rates affect the price of our stock 

 

as a real estate investment trust the market value of our equity securities in general is based primarily upon the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends our equity securities’ market value is based secondarily upon the market value of our underlying real estate assets for this reason shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of our stock our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock further the distribution yield on the stock as 

  a percentage of the price of the stock relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of our stock an increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield which would adversely affect our stock’s market price additionally if the market price of our stock declines significantly then we might breach certain covenants with respect to our debt obligations which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 

 

we could change our investment and financing policies without a vote of stockholders 

 

subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances our board of directors determines our investment and financing policies our growth strategy and our debt capitalization distribution and operating policies our board of directors may revise or amend these strategies and policies at any time without a vote of stockholders any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 

 

shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

the operating partnership and amb property ii lp had 4709056 common limited partnership units issued and outstanding as of december 31 2006 which may be exchanged generally one year after their issuance on a oneforone basis into shares of our common stock in the future the operating partnership or amb property ii lp may issue additional limited partnership units and we may issue shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of properties or in private placements these shares of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets over time pursuant to registration rights that we have granted or may grant in connection with future issuances or pursuant to rule 144 in addition common stock issued under our stock option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that we have filed or pursuant to rule 144 as of december 31 2006 under our stock option and incentive plans we had 3230106 shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance had outstanding options to purchase 6843025 shares of common stock of which 5404361 are vested and exercisable and had 611549 unvested restricted shares of common stock outstanding future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock further the existence of the operating partnership’s limited partnership units and the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the exercise of options and registration rights referred to above may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities

industrial properties 

 

as of december 31 2006 we owned and managed 964 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 1007 million rentable square feet on a consolidated basis we had 820 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 803 million rentable square feet excluding development and renovation projects and recently completed development projects available for sale or contribution located in 34 markets throughout the united states and in china france germany japan mexico and the netherlands our industrial properties were 961 leased to 2633 customers the largest of which accounted for no more than 31 of our annualized base rent from our industrial properties see part iv item 15 note 16 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for segment information related to our operations 

 

property characteristics our industrial properties which consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers are typically comprised of multiple buildings 

   

the following table identifies types and characteristics of our industrial buildings and each type’s percentage based on square footage of our total owned and managed operating portfolio which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10 ownership interest for which we are the property or asset manager and which we intend to hold for the longterm 

 

 

 

 

  

lease terms our industrial properties are typically subject to lease on a “triple net basis” in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance and operating costs or are subject to leases on a “modified gross basis” in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels in addition most of our leases include fixed rental increases or consumer price indexbased rental increases lease terms typically range from three to ten years with a weighted average of six years excluding renewal options however the majority of our industrial leases do not include renewal options 

 

overview of major target markets our industrial properties are typically located near major airports key interstate highways and seaports in major us metropolitan areas which currently comprise atlanta chicago dallas los angeles miami northern new jerseynew york city the san francisco bay area and seattle our other us target markets include austin baltimorewashington dc boston houston minneapolis and orlando our nonus industrial properties are located in major distribution markets including amsterdam frankfurt guadalajara hamburg lyon mexico city osaka paris queretaro shanghai singapore tokyo and toronto 

 

within these metropolitan areas our industrial properties are generally concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established relatively large submarkets which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere these infill locations are typically near major airports seaports or convenient to major highways and rail lines and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools there is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrally located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses including warehouse distribution light assembly and manufacturing we generally avoid locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties

as of december 31 2006 we had 14 billion of secured indebtedness net of unamortized premiums secured by deeds of trust or mortgages as of december 31 2006 the total gross consolidated investment value of those properties securing the debt was 26 billion of the 14 billion of secured indebtedness 10 billion was consolidated joint venture debt secured by properties with a gross investment value of 19 billion for additional details see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” and part iv item 15 note 6 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in this report we believe that as of december 31 2006 the fair value of the properties securing the respective obligations in each case exceeded the principal amount of the outstanding obligations

general 

 

you should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

we commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on november 26 1997 and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended with our initial tax return for the year ended december 31 1997 amb property corporation and amb property lp were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering 

 

management’s overview 

 

the primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under longterm generally three to ten years operating leases at our properties including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business we also produce earnings from the disposition of operating assets that no longer fit our strategy from the disposition of projects in our developmentforsale program and from the contributions of properties to our coinvestment joint ventures our longterm growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties 

 

national industrial markets continued to improve during 2006 when compared with market conditions in 2005 according to torto wheaton research availability dropped 10 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 94 and availability for the year dropped 50 basis points we believe the strongest industrial markets in the us are the coastal gateway markets tied to global trade including los angeles our largest market miami the san francisco bay area and seattle and to a lesser degree northern new jerseynew york with the exception of the exit 8a submarket while we believe that the broader chicago market is showing signs of stabilization certain submarkets like the o’hare submarket are relatively strong we believe dallas continues to recover and atlanta continues to suffer from a large increase in supply we believe the operating environment in our us ontarmac business remains good with improving cargo volumes and essentially no new supply 

 

investor demand for industrial property as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates has remained consistently strong over the past several years we believe we capitalized on this demand for industrial property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio through the disposition of noncore properties which was effectively completed in 2006 with our exit from the charlotte and memphis markets we plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis or that no longer fit our strategic investment objectives but we believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals 

 

occupancy levels in our portfolio continue to outperform the national industrial market as determined by torto wheaton research by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions during the prior periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new longerterm leases during periods of growing rental rates when we sign leases of shorter duration we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages appropriate to the lease term in our stronger markets we are increasing rents as opposed to occupancy 

   

the table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics for our owned and managed operating properties for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

 

  

at december 31 2006 our operating portfolio’s occupancy rate was 961 on an owned and managed basis 970 on a consolidated basis an increase from both the prior quarter and december 31 2005 rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 41 in the fourth quarter of 2006 and decreased 01 for the full year cash basis same store net operating income rental revenues less property operating expenses and real estate taxes for properties included in the same store pool which is set annually and excludes properties purchased or developments stabilized after december 31 2004 grew by 13 in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 26 for the fullyear 2006 on an owned and managed basis excluding lease termination fees same store net operating income grew 30 and 32 in the quarter and for the full year decreased 05 and increased 16 respectively on a consolidated basis respectively on an owned and managed basis see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — supplemental earnings measures” for a discussion of same store net operating income and a reconciliation of same store net operating income and net income we currently expect that same store growth in our operating portfolio excluding lease termination fees will be about 3 to 4 for 2007 on an owned and managed basis market rents continue to rebound from their lows and in many of our hub and gateway markets are back to or above their prior peak levels of 2001 

 

we believe that industrial market rents in the san francisco bay area are improving while market rents in the san francisco bay area were up 10 to 15 in 2006 rents still have not yet fully recovered to normal levels rents on lease renewals and rollovers in the san francisco bay area declined 210 in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 132 for the fullyear 2006 on an owned and managed basis without the effect of the san francisco bay area rents on renewals and rollovers for the fullyear 2006 would have been 20 on an owned and managed basis which we believe reflects the generally positive trends in us industrial space availability 

 

we expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline and contribute completed development projects into our coinvestment program and recognize development profits we believe that development renovation and expansion of welllocated high 

  quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties we believe that our development opportunities in mexico japan and china are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries prior to our global expansion our development pipeline was 1068 million at the end of 2002 as a result of our global expansion and increased development capabilities we have increased our development pipeline to approximately 13 billion at december 31 2006 in addition to our committed development pipeline we hold a total of 1735 acres for future development or sale of which 92 is in north america we believe these 1735 acres of land could support approximately 305 million square feet of future development 

 

going forward we believe that our coinvestment program with privatecapital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for new investments through these coinvestment joint ventures we typically earn acquisition fees asset management fees and priority distributions as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the coinvestment joint ventures however we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so through contribution of development properties to our coinvestment joint ventures we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline as of december 31 2006 we owned approximately 643 million square feet of our properties 516 of the total operating and development portfolio through our consolidated and unconsolidated coinvestment joint ventures we may make additional investments through these coinvestment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so 

 

by the end of 2010 we expect to have approximately 50 of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in nonus markets based on owned and managed annualized base rent as of december 31 2006 our nonus operating properties comprised 141 of our owned and managed operating portfolio based on annualized base rent and 74 of our consolidated operating portfolio based on annualized base rent our north american target countries outside of the united states currently comprise canada and mexico our european target countries currently comprise belgium france germany italy the netherlands spain and the united kingdom our asian target countries currently comprise china india japan singapore and south korea we expect to add additional target countries outside the united states in the future 

 

to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income as a result we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our ongoing operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can we must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs acquisitions and developments see “liquidity and capital resources” for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital

critical accounting policies 

 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

 

investments in real estate investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value we also regularly review the impact of above or belowmarket leases inplace leases and lease origination costs for all new acquisitions and record an intangible asset or liability accordingly carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a propertybyproperty basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges are less than the carrying value of the property the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions and the availability of capital if impairment analysis assumptions change then an adjustment to the carrying value of our longlived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change to the extent that a property is impaired the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings as a result of leasing activity and the economic environment we reevaluated the carrying value of our investments and recorded impairment charges of 63 million during the year ended december 31 2006 on certain of our investments 

 

revenue recognition we record rental revenue from operating leases on a straightline basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments if customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts security deposits and letters of credit then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable including straightline rents for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed we also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us if a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s occupancy 

 

property dispositions we report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations first when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by thirdparty investors for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real estate interests in the statement of operations second we dispose of valueadded conversion projects and buildtosuit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale the gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes when applicable and are included in development profits net of taxes in the statement of operations lastly 

  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets requires us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties which is included in gains from dispositions of real estate net of minority interests in the statement of operations the consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification there is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position net income or cash flows in all cases gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met 

 

joint ventures we hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures we determine consolidation based on standards set forth in eitf 045 determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights or fasb interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities “fin 46” based on the guidance set forth in eitf 045 we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets selection of property managers asset management investment activity and changes in financing for joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under fin 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes for joint ventures under eitf 045 where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions but where we exercise significant influence we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes 

 

real estate investment trust as a real estate investment trust we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the us if we meet minimum distribution income asset and shareholder tests however some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes in addition foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country an income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities a deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in gaap versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition however we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

effective october 1 2006 we deconsolidated amb institutional alliance fund iii lp on a prospective basis due to the reevaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partner’s rights effective october 1 2006 as a result our results of operations presented below are not comparable between years presented 

 

the analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth acquisitions development activity and divestitures same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods excluding development properties stabilized after december 31 2004 generally defined as properties that are 90 leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months 

 

as of december 31 2006 same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 712 million square feet the properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings aggregating approximately 66 million square feet the properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings aggregating approximately 69 million square feet during 2006 property divestitures and contributions consisted of 50 buildings aggregating approximately 75 million square feet in 2005 property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings aggregating approximately 106 million square feet our future financial condition and results of operations including rental revenues may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results 

   

for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 dollars in millions 

 

 

 

us industrial same store revenues increased 134 million from the prior year despite the decrease of 128 million in same store revenues due to the deconsolidation of amb institutional alliance fund iii lp effective october 1 2006 attributable primarily to improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various markets the properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings aggregating approximately 69 million square feet the properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings aggregating approximately 66 million square feet other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties nonus industrial revenues increased approximately 294 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in japan and the continued acquisition of properties in france germany and mexico the increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management and acquisition fees from additional assets held in coinvestment joint ventures which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive distributions of approximately 39 million during 2006 we received 

  incentive distributions of 225 million of which 198 million was from amb partners ii lp as compared to incentive distribution of 264 million for the sale of amb institutional alliance fund i lp during 2005 

 

 

 

same store properties’ operating expenses increased 65 million from the prior year despite the decrease of 25 million in same store operating expenses due to the deconsolidation of amb institutional alliance fund iii lp effective october 1 2006 due primarily to increased insurance costs utility expenses repair and maintenance expenses and other nonreimbursable expenses the 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings aggregating approximately 69 million square feet the 2006 acquisitions consisted of 73 buildings aggregating approximately 66 million square feet other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties nonus industrial revenues increased approximately 60 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in japan and the continued acquisition of properties in france germany and mexico the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate the 2006 impairment loss was taken on several noncore assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and the holding period of certain assets the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stockbased compensation expense as a result of higher values assigned to option and stock awards and executive departures additional staffing and expenses for our international expansion and the acquisition of amb blackpine other expenses decreased approximately 24 million from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in losses associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in certain deal costs fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our coinvestment joint ventures 

 

   

 

the 124 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to gains of 175 million from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated coinvestment joint ventures during 2006 as opposed to 55 million of such gains during 2005 and effective october 1 2006 the deconsolidation of amb institutional alliance fund iii lp which resulted in an increase of approximately 51 million these increases were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our unconsolidated joint ventures the increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and an increase in property management income due to the expansion of our property management business the 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of 1069 million using the exchange rate in effect at contribution in operating properties to our then newly formed unconsolidated coinvestment joint venture amb japan fund i lp development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our developmentforsale program the increase in development profits was due to increased disposition and contribution volume during 2006 during 2006 we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 13 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of 866 million resulting in an aftertax gain of 133 million in addition during 2006 we received approximately 04 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of 10 million 08 million of which was the joint venture partner’s share during 2006 we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated coinvestment joint ventures four projects totaling approximately 26 million square feet were contributed into amb japan fund i lp two projects totaling approximately 08 million square feet were contributed into ambsgp mexico llc three projects totaling approximately 06 million square feet were contributed into amb institutional alliance fund iii lp and one land parcel into amb dfs fund i llc as a result of these contributions we recognized an aggregate aftertax gain of 941 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the thirdparty investors for cash during 2005 we sold five land parcels and five development projects aggregating approximately 09 million square feet for an aggregate price of 1552 million resulting in an aftertax gain of 451 million in addition during 2005 we received final proceeds of 78 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004 during 2005 we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture ambsgp mexico llc and recognized an aftertax gain of 19 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the thirdparty coinvestor for cash the increase in interest expense including amortization was due primarily to increased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and other debt

the 70 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to a gain of 54 million from the disposition of real estate by one of our unconsolidated coinvestment joint ventures during the 

  second quarter of 2005 the increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income the 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of 1069 million using exchange rate in effect at contribution in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated coinvestment joint venture amb japan fund i lp the 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of 715 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated coinvestment joint venture ambsgp mexico llc development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our developmentforsale program the increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005 during 2005 we sold five land parcels and five development projects aggregating approximately 09 million square feet for an aggregate price of 1552 million resulting in an aftertax gain of 451 million in addition during 2005 we received final proceeds of 78 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004 during 2005 we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture ambsgp mexico llc and recognized an aftertax gain of 19 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the thirdparty coinvestor for cash during 2004 we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our developmentforsale program aggregating approximately 03 million square feet for an aggregate price of 404 million resulting in an aftertax gain of 65 million during 2004 we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture ambsgp mexico llc and recognized an aftertax gain of 20 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the thirdparty coinvestor for cash

in december 2005 we issued 3000000 shares of 70 series o cumulative redeemable preferred stock the increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

balance sheet strategy in general we use unsecured lines of credit unsecured notes preferred stock and common equity issued by us andor the operating partnership and its subsidiaries to capitalize our 100owned assets over time we plan to retire nonrecourse secured debt encumbering our 100owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes in managing our coinvestment joint ventures in general we use nonrecourse secured debt to capitalize our coinvestment joint ventures 

 

we currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions development expansion and renovation of properties will include

we currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include 

 

  

cash flows as of december 31 2006 cash provided by operating activities was 3359 million as compared to 2958 million for the same period in 2005 this change is primarily due to increases in rental rates partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives including our international and development expansions and increased occupancy costs related to the expansion of regional offices cash used for investing activities was 8806 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to cash used for investing activities of 604 million for the same period in 2005 this change is primarily due to an increase in funds used for property acquisitions and capital expenditures and a decrease in proceeds from property divestitures mainly due to the divesture of amb institutional alliance fund i lp portfolio in 2005 offset by less funds used for additions to interests in unconsolidated joint ventures and an increase in capital distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures cash provided by financing activities was 4836 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to cash used in financing activities of 1019 million for the same period in 2005 this change is due primarily to an increase in borrowings net of repayments issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options and issuances of preferred stock offset by the cost of the repurchase of preferred units for the year ended december 31 2006 

 

we believe that our sources of working capital specifically our cash flow from operations borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future the unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock

debt in order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debttoour share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45 or less as of december 31 2006 our share of total debttoour share of total market capitalization ratio was 342 see footnote 1 to the capitalization ratios table below for our definitions of “our share of total market capitalization” “market equity” and “our share of total debt” however we typically finance our coinvestment joint ventures with secured debt at a loantovalue ratio of 5065 per our joint venture agreements additionally we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt regardless of these policies however our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur accordingly our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies 

 

as of december 31 2006 the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was 14 billion excluding unamortized debt premiums of 63 million of the 14 billion of secured debt 10 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures the secured debt is generally nonrecourse and bears interest at rates varying from 29 to 104 per annum with a weighted average rate of 62 and final maturity dates ranging from february 2007 to january 2025 as of december 31 2006 10 billion of the secured debt obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 61 while the remaining 3861 million bear interest at variable rates with a weighted average interest rate of 47

we guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to its senior debt securities if we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase this increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock

coinvestment joint ventures through the operating partnership we enter into coinvestment joint ventures with institutional investors these coinvestment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions development projects and renovation projects as well as private capital income as of december 31 2006 we had investments in coinvestment joint ventures with a gross book value of 19 billion which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and net equity investments in four unconsolidated coinvestment joint ventures of 2360 million and a gross book value of 25 billion as of december 31 2006 we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned coinvestment joint ventures of up to 1682 million using the exchange rates at december 31 2006 pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreements from time to time we may raise additional equity commitments for amb institutional alliance fund iii lp an openended unconsolidated coinvestment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors which invests through a private real estate investment trust this would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund we are obligated to contribute 20 of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than 1500 million at which time our obligation is reduced to 10 of the total equity commitments we expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations borrowings under our credit facilities debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures which could adversely effect our cash flow

  we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs premiums paid to arcata may be adjusted based on this estimate like premiums paid to thirdparty insurance companies premiums paid to arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms through this structure we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

standby letters of credit as of december 31 2006 we had provided approximately 221 million in letters of credit of which 117 million was provided under the operating partnership’s 5500 million unsecured credit facility the letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions bank guarantees and other commitments

  pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us from time to time in the normal course of our business we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments pay promotes or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events 

 

supplemental earnings measures 

 

ffo we believe that net income as defined by gaap is the most appropriate earnings measure however we consider funds from operations or ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance ffo is defined as net income calculated in accordance with gaap less gains or losses from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estaterelated depreciation and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of ffo of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures further we do not adjust ffo to eliminate the effects of nonrecurring charges we believe that ffo as defined by nareit is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization among other items from net income as defined by gaap we believe that the use of ffo combined with the required gaap presentations has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful we consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization ffo can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies 

 

while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance ffo also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is ffo necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements further our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 

 

the following table reflects the calculation of ffo reconciled from net income for the years ended december 31 dollars in thousands

ss noi we believe that net income as defined by gaap is the most appropriate earnings measure however we consider same store net operating income or ss noi to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance for properties that are considered part of the same store pool see part i item 2 “properties — industrial properties — owned and managed market operating statistics” note 6 and “owned and managed operating and leasing statistics — owned and managed same store operating statistics” note 2 in deriving ss noi we define noi as rental revenues as calculated in accordance with gaap including reimbursements less straightline rents property operating expenses and real estate taxes we exclude straightline rents in calculating ss noi because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a yearoveryear comparison in addition we believe that ss noi helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate as compared to other companies 

 

while ss noi is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance ss noi also does not reflect general and administrative expense interest expenses depreciation and amortization costs capital expenditures and leasing costs or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations further our computation of ss noi may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating ss noi 

   

the following table reconciles ss noi from net income for the years ended december 31 dollars in thousands

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices interest rates and international exchange rates our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates accordingly we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service acquisitions capital expenditures distributions to stockholders and unitholders and other cash requirements the majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval thereby increasing our debt service obligations which could adversely affect our cash flows as of december 31 2006 we had three outstanding interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 381 million in us dollars see “financial instruments” below 

 

the table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before net unamortized debt discounts of 43 million as of december 31 2006 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10 then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be 49 million net of swaps annually as of december 31 

  2006 the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt both secured and unsecured was 34 and 35 billion respectively based on our estimate of current market interest rates 

 

as of december 31 2006 and 2005 variable rate debt comprised 371 and 245 respectively of all our outstanding debt variable rate debt was 13 billion and 8317 million respectively as of december 31 2006 and 2005 the increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities this increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations 

 

financial instruments we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income for revenues or expenses denominated in nonfunctional currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk our derivative financial instruments in effect at december 31 2006 were three interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on us libor usd and euribor europe 

 

the following table summarizes our financial instruments as of december 31 2006 in thousands 

 

 

 

international operations our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk the us dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the united states and mexico the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the united states is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar translate their financial statements into us dollars assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date we translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date the losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and totaled 02 million for year ended december 31 2006 

 

our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency in these instances nonmonetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period for the year ended december 31 2006 losses from remeasurement and the sale of four foreign exchange agreements included in our results of operations totaled 08 million 

 

we also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated

disclosure controls and procedures and changes to internal control over financial reporting 

 

as required by rule 13a15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures that were in effect as of the end of the year covered by this report our chief executive officer and chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2006 

 

no changes were made in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions involving our assets 

 

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 

 

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

 

our management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control — integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on our evaluation under the framework in “internal control — integrated framework” our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2006 

   

our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 has been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp as stated in their report which appears herein

 item 1 business tableend general 

  amb property corporation a maryland corporation acquires develops and operates industrial properties in key distribution markets throughout north america europe and asia we use the terms “industrial properties” or “industrial buildings” to describe various types of industrial properties in our portfolio and use these terms interchangeably with the following logistics facilities centers or warehouses distribution facilities centers or warehouses high throughput distribution ® “htd ® ” facilities or any combination of these terms 

  we commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on november 26 1997 our strategy focuses on providing properties for customers who value the efficient movement of goods in the world’s busiest distribution markets large supplyconstrained locations with proximity to airports seaports and major highway systems as of december 31 2005 we owned or had investments in on a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint ventures or managed buildings properties and development projects expected to total approximately 1150 million rentable square feet 107 million square meters and 1057 buildings in 42 markets within eleven countries 

  we operate our business through our subsidiary amb property lp a delaware limited partnership which we refer to as the “operating partnership” as of december 31 2005 we owned an approximate 951 general partnership interest in the operating partnership excluding preferred units as the sole general partner of the operating partnership we have the full exclusive and complete responsibility for and discretion in its dayto day management and control 

  our investment strategy generally targets customers whose businesses are tied to global trade which according to the world trade organization has grown more than three times the world gross domestic product growth rate during the last 20 years to serve the facilities needs of these customers we seek to invest in major distribution markets transportation hubs and gateways both domestically and internationally our investment strategy targets markets that are generally characterized by large population densities and typically offer substantial consumer bases proximity to large clusters of distributionfacility users and significant labor pools when measured by total consolidated and unconsolidated annualized base rents 946 of our portfolio of industrial properties is located in our target markets and much of it in infill submarkets within our target markets infill locations are characterized by supply constraints on the availability of land for competing projects as well as physical political or economic barriers to new development 

  our strategy is to become a leading provider of industrial properties in supplyconstrained submarkets located near key international passenger and cargo airports highway systems and seaports in major metropolitan areas of north america europe and asia these submarkets are generally tied to global trade 

  further we focus on high throughput distribution ® “htd ® ” facilities which are buildings designed to facilitate the distribution of our customers’ products rather than store them our investment focus on htd assets is based on what we believe to be a global trend toward lower inventory levels and expedited supply chains htd facilities generally have a variety of physical characteristics that allow for the rapid transport of goods from pointto point these physical characteristics could include numerous dock doors shallower building depths fewer columns large truck courts and more space for trailer parking we believe that these building characteristics represent an important success factor for timesensitive customers such as air express logistics and freight forwarding companies and that these facilities function best when located in convenient proximity to transportation infrastructure such as major airports and seaports 

  of the approximately 1150 million rentable square feet as of december 31 2005 

 3    during 2005 our property acquisitions totaled 5550 millionincluding expected capital expenditures primarily in target metropolitan markets including amsterdam boston chicago dallas los angeles guadalajara hamburg shanghai and tokyo as of december 31 2005 we had five industrial buildings and one undeveloped land parcel held for divestiture our dispositions during 2005 totaled 9266 million including assets in markets that no longer fit our investment strategy and properties at valuations that we considered to be at premium levels while we continue to sell assets we believe that we have substantially achieved our nearterm strategic disposition goals additionally we contributed 1305 million of operating assets to a private capital joint venture as part of our continuing strategy to increase the proportion of our assets owned in coinvestment joint ventures 

  we are selfadministered and selfmanaged and expect that we have qualified and will continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended december 31 1997 as a selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust our own employees perform our corporate administrative and management functions rather than our relying on an outside manager for these services we manage our portfolio of properties in a flexible operating model which includes both direct property management and a strategic alliance program ® in which we have established relationships with thirdparty real estate management firms brokers and developers that provide propertylevel administrative and management services under our direction 

  our principal executive office is located at pier 1 bay 1 san francisco california 94111 our telephone number is 415 3949000 we maintain regional offices in amsterdam boston chicago los angeles new jersey shanghai singapore tokyo and vancouver as of december 31 2005 we employed 309 individuals 161 at our san francisco headquarters 60 in our boston office and the remainder in our other regional offices our website address is wwwambcom  our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 are available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the us securities and exchange commission information contained on our website is not and should not be deemed a part of this annual report or any other report or filing filed with the us securities and exchange commission 

  unless the context otherwise requires the terms “we” “us” and “our” refer to amb property corporation amb property lp and their other controlled subsidiaries and the references to amb property corporation include amb property lp and their controlled subsidiaries we refer to amb property lp as the “operating partnership” the following marks are our registered trademarks amb ®  htd ®  and high throughput distribution ®  

4 operating strategy 

  we base our operating strategy on a variety of operational and service offerings including inhouse acquisitions development redevelopment asset management property management leasing finance accounting and market research our strategy is to leverage our expertise across a large customer base and complement our internal management resources with longstanding relationships with entrepreneurial real estate management and development firms in our target markets 

  we believe that real estate is fundamentally a local business and best operated by local teams in each market comprised of amb employees local alliance partners or both we intend to increase utilization of internal management resources in target markets to achieve both operating efficiencies and to expose our customers to the broadening array of amb service offerings including access to multiple locations worldwide and buildto suit developments we actively manage our portfolio whether directly or with an alliance partner by establishing leasing strategies negotiating lease terms pricing and level and timing of property improvements 

growth strategies 

   we seek to generate longterm internal growth through rent increases on existing space and renewals on rollover space by working to maintain a high occupancy rate at our properties and to control expenses by capitalizing on the economies of scale inherent in owning operating and growing a large global portfolio however during 2005 our average industrial property base rental rates decreased by 97 from the rent in place at expiration for that space on leases entered into or renewed during the period this amount excludes expense reimbursements rental abatements percentage rents and straightline rents since 2001 as the industrial property market weakened we have focused on maintaining occupancy levels during 2005 cashbasis samestore net operating income rental revenues less property operating expenses and real estate taxes for properties included in the samestore pool which is set annually and excludes properties purchased or developments stabilized after december 31 2003 increased by 01 on our industrial properties since our initial public offering in november 1997 we have experienced average annual increases in industrial property base rental rates of 49 and maintained an average quarterend occupancy of 949 in our industrial property operating portfolio while we believe that it is important to view real estate as a longterm investment past results are not necessarily an indication of future performance see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — supplemental earnings measures” for a discussion of net operating income and part iv item 15 note 16 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for detailed segment information including revenue attributable to each segment gross investment in each segment and total assets 

   we believe that development redevelopment and expansion of welllocated highquality industrial properties should continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties we believe we have the inhouse expertise to create value both through new construction and acquisition and management of valueadded properties valueadded conversion projects represent the repurposing of land or a building site for a more valuable use and may include such activities as rezoning redesigning reconstructing and retenanting both new development and valueadded conversions require significant management attention and capital investment to maximize their return completed development properties may be held in our portfolio sold to third parties or contributed to our coinvestment joint ventures we believe our global market presence and expertise will enable us to continue to generate and capitalize on a diverse range of development opportunities 

  we believe that the multidisciplinary backgrounds of our employees should provide us with the skills and experience to capitalize on strategic renovation expansion and development opportunities many of our officers have specific experience in real estate development both with us and with national development firms and over the past two years we have expanded our development staff we pursue development projects 

5 directly and in joint ventures providing us with the flexibility to pursue development projects independently or in partnerships depending on market conditions submarkets or building sites 

   we believe that our acquisition experience and our network of property management leasing and acquisition resources will continue to provide opportunities for growth in addition to our internal resources we have longterm relationships with thirdparty local property management firms which we believe may give us access to additional acquisition opportunities as such managers frequently market properties on behalf of sellers we believe also that our upreit structure enables us to acquire land and industrial properties in exchange for limited partnership units in the operating partnership or amb property ii lp thereby enhancing our attractiveness to owners and developers seeking to transfer properties on a taxdeferred basis going forward we believe that amb institutional alliance fund iii lp will serve as our primary source of capital for acquisitions of operating properties within the us in addition we seek to redeploy capital from nonstrategic assets into properties that better fit our current investment focus 

  we are generally engaged in various stages of negotiations for a number of acquisitions and dispositions that may include acquisitions and dispositions of individual properties large multiproperty portfolios or other real estate companies we cannot assure you that we will consummate any of these transactions such transactions if we consummate them may be material individually or in the aggregate sources of capital for acquisitions may include retained cash flow from operations borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities other forms of secured or unsecured debt financing issuances of debt or preferred or common equity securities by us or the operating partnership including issuances of units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries proceeds from divestitures of properties assumption of debt related to the acquired properties and private capital from our coinvestment partners see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — summary of key transactions in 2005” 

   by the end of 2007 we plan to have approximately 15 of our operating portfolio based on consolidated and unconsolidated annualized base rent invested in international markets as of december 31 2005 our international operating properties comprised 37 of our consolidated annualized base rent when international operating properties owned in unconsolidated joint ventures are included our annualized base rents from international investments increases to 71 our north american target markets outside of the united states currently comprise guadalajara mexico city monterrey and toronto our european target markets currently comprise amsterdam brussels frankfurt hamburg london lyon madrid milan and paris our asian target markets currently include beijing busan nagoya osaka the pearl river delta seoul shanghai singapore and tokyo we expect to add additional target markets outside the united states in the future 

  we believe that expansion into international target markets represents a natural extension of our strategy to invest in industrial property markets with high population densities close proximity to large customer clusters and available labor pools and major distribution centers serving global trade our international expansion strategy mirrors our domestic focus on supplyconstrained submarkets with political economic or physical constraints to new development our international investments extend our offering of high throughput distribution ® facilities for customers who value speedto market over storage specifically we are focused on customers whose business is derived from global trade in addition our investments target major consumer distribution markets and customers we believe that our established customer relationships our contacts in the air cargo and logistics industries our underwriting of markets and investments and our strategic alliances with knowledgeable developers and managers will assist us in competing internationally 

  there are many factors that could cause our entry into target markets and future capital allocation to differ from our current expectations which are discussed in this report under the heading business risks — risks associated with our international business” further it is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience market opportunities customer needs and changes in global distribution 

6 patterns for a discussion of the amount of our revenues attributable to the united states and international markets please see part iv item 15 note 16 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

   we coinvest in properties with privatecapital investors through partnerships limited liability companies or joint ventures our coinvestment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and typically operate under the same investment strategy that we apply to our other operations typically we will own a 2050 interest in our coinvestment joint ventures we believe that our coinvestment program will continue to serve as a source of capital for acquisitions and developments however we cannot assure you that it will continue to do so in addition our coinvestment joint ventures typically allow us to earn acquisition and development fees asset management fees or priority distributions as well as promoted interests or incentive distributions based on the performance of the coinvestment joint ventures as of december 31 2005 we owned approximately 548 million square feet of our properties 477 of the total operating and development portfolio through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures

 item 1a risk factors tableend 

business risks 

  our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to us these risks include among others 

general real estate industry risks 

   the investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the properties as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties if our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures then our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected in addition there are significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate such as mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs that generally do not decline when circumstances reduce the income from the property income from and the value of our properties may be adversely affected by 

   in addition periods of economic slowdown or recession in the united states and in other countries rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate or public perception that any of these events may occur would result in a general decrease in rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases which 

7 would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations future terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity which could reduce the demand for and the value of our properties to the extent that future attacks impact our customers their businesses similarly could be adversely affected including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases 

  our properties are concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector as a result of this concentration we would feel the impact of an economic downturn in this sector more acutely than if our portfolio included other property types 

   as of december 31 2005 leases on a total of 162 of our industrial properties based on annualized base rent will expire on or prior to december 31 2006 we derive most of our income from rent received from our customers accordingly our financial condition results of operations cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew these expiring leases or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected if a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other type of financial distress then it may be unable to make timely rental payments or renew its lease further our ability to rent space and the rents that we can charge are impacted not only by customer demand but by the number of other properties we have to compete with to appeal to customers 

   we compete with other developers owners and operators of real estate some of which own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located if our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants we may lose potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants’ leases expire as a result our financial condition cash flow cash available for distribution trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected 

   real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of assets further as a real estate investment trust the internal revenue code regulates the number of properties that we can dispose of in a year their tax bases and the cost of improvements that we make to the properties in addition a portion of the properties held directly or indirectly by certain of our subsidiary partnerships were acquired in exchange for limited partnership units in the applicable partnership the contribution agreements for such properties may contain restrictions on certain sales exchanges or other dispositions of these properties or a portion thereof that result in a taxable transaction for specified periods following the contribution of these properties to the applicable partnership these limitations may affect our ability to sell properties this lack of liquidity and the internal revenue code restrictions may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and as a result could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

   our results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of our common stock would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their lease obligations to us in the event of a significant number of lease defaults our cash flow may not be sufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders and repay maturing debt as of december 31 2005 we did not have any single tenant account for annualized 

8 base rent revenues greater than 37 however in the event of lease defaults by a significant number of our tenants we may incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord 

   we acquire and intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties the acquisition of properties entails various risks including the risks that our investments may not perform as we expect that we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate our new acquisitions into our existing operations and that our cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate further we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other wellcapitalized real estate investors including both publiclytraded real estate investment trusts and private institutional investment funds this competition increases as investments in real estate become increasingly attractive relative to other forms of investment as a result of competition we may be unable to acquire additional properties as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly elevated in addition we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership or its subsidiaries and proceeds from property divestitures which may not be available and which could adversely affect our cash flow any of the above risks could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

   as part of our business we develop new and renovate existing properties the real estate development and renovation business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock which include the following risks 

 

risks associated with our international business 

   we have acquired and developed and expect to continue to acquire and develop properties outside the united states because local markets affect our operations our international investments are subject to economic fluctuations in the international locations in which we invest in addition our international operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations including those governing the taxation of our international revenues restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world uncertainty over property rights and political instability we cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur further we have entered and may in the future enter into agreements with nonus entities that are governed by the laws of and are 

9 subject to dispute resolution in the courts of another country or region we cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise and even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis or at all 

  further our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through international property acquisitions and developments if we fail to effectively manage our international growth then our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected 

   we have acquired and may continue to acquire properties in international markets that are new to us when we acquire properties located in these markets we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures we work to mitigate such risks through extensive diligence and research and associations with experienced partners however there can be no guarantee that all such risks will be eliminated 

   we are pursuing and intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets as we invest in countries where the us dollar is not the national currency we are subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the currencies of those other countries a significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations we attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing under our multicurrency credit facility in the currency of the country we are investing in and under certain circumstances by putting in place international currency put option contracts hedging exchange rate fluctuations for leases denominated in international currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international exchange risk we cannot however assure you that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks if we do engage in international currency exchange rate hedging activities any income recognized with respect to these hedges as well as any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 

general business risks 

   as of december 31 2005 our industrial properties located in california represented 276 of the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating properties and 285 of our industrial annualized base rent our revenue from and the value of our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california’s economic climate because of the number of properties we have located in california a downturn in california’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

   we carry commercial liability property and rental loss insurance covering all the properties that we own and manage in types and amounts that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risks applicable to the property the cost of coverage and industry practice certain losses such as those due to 

10 terrorism windstorms floods or seismic activity may be insured subject to certain limitations including large deductibles or copayments and policy limits although we have obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism with policy specifications and insured limits that we consider commercially reasonable given the cost and availability of such coverage we cannot be certain that we will be able to renew coverage on comparable terms or collect under such policies in addition there are other types of losses such as those from riots bioterrorism or acts of war that are not generally insured in our industry because it is not economically feasible to do so we may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds our insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and if there is recourse debt then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties moreover as the general partner of the operating partnership we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnership’s unsatisfied recourse obligations including any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of coinvestment joint ventures any such losses could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

  a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity domestic properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the san francisco bay area los angeles memphis and seattle our largest concentration of such properties is in california where as of december 31 2005 we had 253 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 243 million square feet and representing 276 of our industrial operating properties based on aggregate square footage and 285 based on industrial annualized base rent international properties located in active seismic areas include tokyo and osaka japan and mexico city mexico we carry replacementcost earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants 

  a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane andor flood risk we carry replacementcost hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants in 2005 various properties that we own or lease in new orleans louisiana and south florida suffered damage as a result of hurricanes katrina and wilma although we expect that our insurance will cover losses arising from this damage in excess of the deductibles paid by us and do not believe that such losses would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results from operations we cannot assure you that we will be reimbursed for all losses incurred 

   as of december 31 2005 we owned approximately 548 million square feet of our properties through several joint ventures limited liability companies or partnerships with third parties our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships limited liability companies or joint ventures and we intend to continue to develop and acquire properties through joint ventures limited liability companies and partnerships with other persons or entities when warranted by the circumstances such partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions partnership limited liability company or joint venture investments involve certain risks including 

 11 

   we generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships limited liability companies and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives however we may not be able to do so and the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

   we intend to continue to divest ourselves of properties that do not meet our strategic objectives provided that we can negotiate acceptable terms and conditions our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors beyond our control including competition from other sellers and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of our properties if we are unable to dispose of properties on favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy then our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected 

  we also anticipate contributing or selling properties to funds and joint ventures if the funds are unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms after currently available capital is depleted or if the value of such properties are appraised at less than the cost of such properties then such contributions or sales could be delayed or prevented adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock for example although we have acquired land for development and made capital commitments in japan and mexico we cannot be assured that we ultimately will be able to contribute such properties to funds or joint ventures as we have planned 

   we have and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties then we might have to pay substantial sums to 

12 settle it which could adversely affect our cash flow unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include 

 

   in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our real estate investment trust taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain and are taxed on our income to the extent it is not fully distributed consequently we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and must rely on thirdparty sources of capital further in order to maintain our reit status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments our ability to access private debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our capital stock

   it is our policy to incur debt either directly or through our subsidiaries only if it will not cause our share of total debtto our share of total market capitalization ratio to exceed approximately 45 our definition of “our share of total market capitalization” is our share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity see footnote 1 to the capitalization ratios table contained in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation — liquidity and capital resources” for our definitions of “market equity” and “our share of total debt” the aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy increases directly with an increase in the market price per share of our capital stock further our management could alter or eliminate this policy without stockholder approval if we change this policy then we could become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders 

   as of december 31 2005 we had total debt outstanding of 34 billion we guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest we anticipate that we will repay only a small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity accordingly we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt if we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at 

13 the time of refinancing such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase 

  in addition if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value a foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

   the terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of financial and other covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit flexibility in our operations and our failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied our payment obligations as of december 31 2005 we had certain nonrecourse secured loans which are crosscollateralized by multiple properties if we default on any of these loans we may then be required to repay such indebtedness together with applicable prepayment charges to avoid foreclosure on all the crosscollateralized properties within the applicable pool foreclosure on our properties or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock in addition our credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain crossdefault provisions which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default these crossdefault provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

   we seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements these agreements involve risks such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations 

conflicts of interest risks 

   certain of our executive officers and directors own interests in other realestate related businesses and investments including retail development projects office buildings and de minimis holdings of the equity securities of public and private real estate companies our executive officers’ continued involvement in other real estaterelated activities could divert their attention from our dayto day operations our executive officers have entered into noncompetition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities directly or indirectly in respect of commercial real estate and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate other than through ownership of not more than 5 of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through certain specified investments state law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements we believe that these properties and activities generally do not directly compete with any of our properties however it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director or an affiliate of an executive officer or director has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property 

14 we will not acquire any properties from our executive officers directors or their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and independent as defined by the rules of the new york stock exchange members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction 

   as the general partner of the operating partnership we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnership’s limited partners the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders in addition those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the operating partnership’s partnership agreement and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights the limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders in addition under the terms of the operating partnership’s partnership agreement holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders 

risks associated with government regulations 

   under various environmental laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at on under or in its property the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial these laws typically impose liability and cleanup responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination 

  environmental laws in some countries including the us also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of our properties may contain asbestoscontaining building materials 

  in addition some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances further certain of our properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in such an instance we underwrite the costs of environmental investigation cleanup and monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate environmental insurance for the property further in connection with certain divested properties we have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties 

  at the time of acquisition we subject all of our properties to a phase i or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants and we may have additional phase ii testing performed upon the consultant’s recommendation these environmental assessments have not revealed and 

15 we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole nonetheless it is possible that the assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities unknown to us or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are greater than we anticipated further our properties’ current environmental condition may be affected by customers the condition of land operations in the vicinity of the properties such as releases from underground storage tanks or by unrelated third parties if the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items then our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected 

   under the americans with disabilities act places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants if we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the americans with disabilities act including removing access barriers then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected our properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and lifesafety requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements while we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

federal income tax risks 

   we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1997 we currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust however it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control for example in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust we must derive at least 95 of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our real estate investment trust taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis these provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification however we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust 

  if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year then we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost 

16 qualification if we lose our real estate investment trust status then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders 

   from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are properly treated as prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions while we believe that the internal revenue service would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes 

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel 

  we depend on the efforts of our executive officers while we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

risks associated with our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

   the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations restatements of our financial statements a decline in our stock price or otherwise materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

risks associated with ownership of our stock 

   certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay defer or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for the common stock to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made furthermore our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12month taxable year or a proportionate part of a short tax year in addition if we or an owner of 10 or more of our stock actually or constructively owns 10 or more of one of our customers 

17 or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner then the rent received by us either directly or through any such partnership from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the internal revenue code to help us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes we prohibit the ownership actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the internal revenue code by any single person of more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our common stock series l preferred stock series m preferred stock and series o preferred stock we also prohibit the ownership actually or constructively of any shares of our series d e f h i j and k preferred stock by any single person so that no such person taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person including any common stock or other series of preferred stock may own in excess of 98 of our issued and outstanding capital stock we refer to this limitation as the “ownership limit” shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale a transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances the ownership limit may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction 

  our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction including a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

  our charter and bylaws and maryland law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors which in turn may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control those provisions in our charter and bylaws include 

   those provisions provided for under maryland law include 

   in addition our board could elect to adopt without stockholder approval certain other provisions under maryland law that may impede a change in control 

   as with other publicly traded securities the trading price of our stock will depend on many factors that are not within our control and may change from time to time including 

   other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future trading price of our stock 

   as a real estate investment trust the market value of our equity securities in general is based primarily upon the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends our equity securities’ market value is based secondarily upon the market value of our underlying real estate assets for this reason shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of our stock our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock further the distribution yield on the stock as a percentage of the price of the stock relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of our stock an increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield which would adversely affect our stock’s market price additionally if the market price of our stock declines significantly then we might breach certain covenants with respect to our debt obligations which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 

   we have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities and to cause the operating partnership to issue limited partnership units in exchange for property or otherwise existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by the operating partnership or us and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholder’s investment 

   subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances our board of directors determines our investment and financing policies our growth strategy and our debt capitalization distribution and operating policies although our board of directors does not presently intend to revise or amend these strategies and policies they may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders any such changes may not 

19 serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 

   the operating partnership and amb property ii lp had 4396525 common limited partnership units issued and outstanding as of december 31 2005 which may be exchanged generally one year after their issuance on a oneforone basis into shares of our common stock in the future the operating partnership or amb property ii lp may issue additional limited partnership units and we may issue shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of properties or in private placements these shares of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets over time pursuant to registration rights that we have granted or may grant in connection with future issuances or pursuant to rule 144 in addition common stock issued under our stock option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that we have filed or pursuant to rule 144 as of december 31 2005 under our stock option and incentive plans we had 3872024 shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance had outstanding options to purchase 9148437 shares of common stock of which 7236870 are vested and exercisable and had 547524 unvested restricted shares of common stock outstanding future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock further the existence of the operating partnership’s limited partnership units and the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the exercise of options and registration rights referred to above may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities

industrial properties 

  as of december 31 2005 on a consolidated basis we owned 876 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 878 million rentable square feet located in 33 markets throughout the united states and in china france germany japan mexico and the netherlands our industrial properties accounted for 5273 million or 997 of our total annualized base rent as of december 31 2005 our industrial properties were 958 leased to 2202 customers the largest of which accounted for no more than 37 of our annualized base rent from our industrial properties see part iv item 15 note 16 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for segment information related to our operations 

  property characteristics our industrial properties which consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers are typically comprised of multiple buildings 

20   the following table identifies type and characteristics of our industrial buildings and each type’s percentage of our total portfolio based on square footage at december 31 

   lease terms our industrial properties are typically subject to lease on a “triple net basis” in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance and operating costs or are subject to leases on a “modified gross basis” in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels in addition most of our leases include fixed rental increases or consumer price indexbased rental increases lease terms typically range from three to ten years with a weighted average of six years excluding renewal options however the majority of our industrial leases do not include renewal options 

  overview of major target markets our industrial properties are typically located near major airports key interstate highways and seaports in major domestic metropolitan areas such as atlanta chicago dallas fort worth los angeles miami northern new jersey new york city the san francisco bay area and seattle our international industrial properties are located in major distribution markets including amsterdam frankfurt guadalajara hamburg mexico city paris shanghai singapore and tokyo 

  within these metropolitan areas industrial properties are generally concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established relatively large submarkets which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere these infill locations are typically near major airports seaports or convenient to major highways and rail lines and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools there is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrally located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses including warehouse distribution light assembly and manufacturing we generally avoid locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

general 

  you should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  we commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on november 26 1997 and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended december 31 1997 amb property corporation and amb property lp were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering 

management’s overview 

  the primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under longterm generally three to ten years operating leases at our properties including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business we also produce earnings from the strategic disposition of operating assets from the disposition of projects in our developmentforsale or contribution program and from contributions of properties to our coinvestment joint ventures our longterm growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties 

  national industrial markets improved during 2005 when compared with market conditions in 2004 according to torto wheaton research the positive trend in demand began in the second quarter of 2004 and reversed 14 prior quarters of negatively trending or rising space availability we believe the protracted period of rising availability created a difficult national leasing environment which is now improving particularly in large industrial property markets tied to global trade during the threeandahalf year period of negatively trending industrial space availability investor demand for industrial property as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates remained consistently strong we believe we capitalized on the demand for acquisition property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio through the disposition of noncore properties we plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis but believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals 

  

   we observed two positive trends nationally for industrial real estate during the year ended december 31 2005 supported by data provided by torto wheaton research first national industrial space availability 

39 declined 130 basis points during the year from 109 to 96 the availability rate has fallen for seven consecutive quarters reversing the trend of the prior 14 quarters in which national industrial space availability increased on average 36 basis points per quarter second national absorption of industrial space defined as the net change in occupied stock as measured by square feet of completions less the change in available square feet totaled approximately 281 million square feet in the year ended december 31 2005 substantially exceeding the 183 million square feet of space absorbed in 2004 and well above the previous tenyear historical average of 139 million square feet of space absorbed annually 

  in this improved environment our industrial portfolio’s occupancy levels increased to 958 at december 31 2005 from 948 at december 31 2004 which we believe reflects higher levels of demand for industrial space generally and in our portfolio specifically during the year ended december 31 2005 our lease expirations totaled approximately 176 million square feet while commencements of new or renewed leases totaled approximately 213 million square feet resulting in an increase in our occupancy level of approximately 100 basis points 

  rental rates on industrial renewals and rollovers in our portfolio decreased 97 during the year ended december 31 2005 as leases were entered into or renewed at rates consistent with what we believe to be current market levels we believe this decline in rents on lease renewals and rollovers reflects trends in national industrial space availability we believe that relatively high levels of national industrial space availability have caused market rents for industrial properties to decline between 10 and 20 from their peak levels in 2001 based on our research data 425 of the space that rolled over in our portfolio in 2005 had commenced between 1999 and 2001 rental rates in our portfolio declined at successively lower rates in each of the last three quarters during 2005 which we believe indicates a stabilization of market rental rate levels while the level of rental rate reduction varied by market we achieved occupancy levels in our portfolio 540 basis points in excess of the national industrial market as determined by torto wheaton research by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions during periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new longerterm leases during periods of growing rental rates when we sign leases of shorter duration we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages appropriate to the lease term 

  we expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline and contribute completed development projects into our coinvestment program and recognize development profits we believe that development renovation and expansion of welllocated highquality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties we believe that our development opportunities in mexico and japan are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries globally we have increased our development pipeline from 1068 million at the end of 2002 to approximately 11 billion at december 31 2005 in addition to our committed development pipeline we hold a total of 1307 acres for future development or sale we believe these 1307 acres of land could support approximately 243 million square feet of future development 

  going forward we believe that our coinvestment program with privatecapital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for acquisitions through these coinvestment joint ventures we typically earn acquisition and development fees asset management fees and priority distributions as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the coinvestment joint ventures however we can not assure you that we will continue to do so through contribution of development properties to our coinvestment joint ventures we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline as of december 31 2005 we owned approximately 548 million square feet of our properties 477 of the total operating and development portfolio through our consolidated and unconsolidated coinvestment joint ventures we may make additional investments through these coinvestment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so 

40   by the end of 2007 we plan to have approximately 15 of our operating portfolio based on both consolidated and unconsolidated annualized base rent invested in international markets our north american target markets outside of the united states currently include guadalajara mexico city monterrey and toronto our european target markets currently include amsterdam brussels frankfurt hamburg london lyon madrid milan and paris our asian target markets currently include beijing busan nagoya osaka the pearl river delta seoul shanghai singapore and tokyo it is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience market opportunities customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns as of december 31 2005 our international operating properties comprised 71 of our annualized base rents including properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures 

  to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income as a result we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our ongoing operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can we must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs acquisitions and developments see “liquidity and capital resources” for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital

critical accounting policies 

  our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  investments in real estate investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value we also record at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for the value attributable to above or belowmarket leases inplace leases and lease origination costs for all acquisitions carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a propertybyproperty basis quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges are less than the carrying amount of the property the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital examples of certain situations that could affect future cash flows of a property may include but are not limited to significant decreases in occupancy unforeseen bankruptcy lease termination and moveout of a major customer or a significant decrease in annual base rents of that property if impairment analysis assumptions change then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our longlived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change to the extent that a property is impaired the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings 

  revenue recognition we record rental revenue from operating leases on a straightline basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments if customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts security deposits and letters of credit then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable including straightline rents for doubtful accounts and 

42 provide allowances as needed we also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us if a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s occupancy 

  property dispositions we report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations first when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by thirdparty investors for cash second we dispose of valueadded conversion projects and buildto suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale the gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes when applicable lastly beginning in 2002 sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  required us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties the consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification there is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position net income or cash flows in all cases gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met 

  joint ventures we hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures we determine consolidation based on standards set forth in eitf 9616 investor’s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights  statement of position 789 accounting for investments in real estate ventures and fasb interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities “fin 46” based on the guidance set forth in these pronouncements we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets selection of property managers asset management investment activity and changes in financing for joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under fin 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes for joint ventures where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions but where we exercise significant influence we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes 

  in june 2005 the emerging issues task force “eitf” issued eitf 045 determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights  under this consensus a sole general partner is presumed to control a limited partnership or similar entity and should consolidate that entity unless the limited partners possess kickout rights or other substantive participating rights as described in eitf 9616 investor’s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights  as of june 29 2005 this consensus was effective immediately for all new or modified agreements and effective beginning in the first reporting period that ends after december 15 2005 for all existing agreements we adopted the consolidation requirements of this consensus in the third quarter 2005 for all new or modified agreements and will adopt the consensus for existing agreements in the first quarter of 2006 there was not a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows upon the adoption of the consolidation requirements of this consensus for all new or modified agreements we do not believe that there will be a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows upon adopting the consensus for existing agreements 

  real estate investment trust as a real estate investment trust we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the us if we meet minimum distribution income asset and shareholder tests however some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes in addition foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country an income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable reit subsidiaries and international entities a deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in gaap versus tax income for items such as 

43 depreciation and gain recognition however we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet 

results of operations 

  the analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth acquisitions development activity and divestitures same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods excluding development properties stabilized after december 31 2003 generally defined as properties that are 90 leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months

for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 dollars in millions 

   the decrease in us industrial same store rental revenues was primarily driven by decreased lease termination fees and decreased rental rates in various markets these decreases were partially offset by increased occupancy industrial same store occupancy was 956 at december 31 2005 and 952 at december 31 2004 for the year ended december 31 2005 rents in the same store portfolio decreased 98 on industrial renewals and rollovers cash basis on 130 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates the properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings aggregating approximately 76 million square feet the properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings aggregating approximately 69 million square feet other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties in 2004 and 2005 we continued to acquire properties in china france germany japan mexico and the netherlands resulting in increased international industrial revenues the increase in private capital income of 310 million was primarily due to incentive distributions for 2005 of 264 million for the sale of amb institutional alliance fund i asset

   the 70 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to a gain of 54 million from the disposition of real estate by one of our unconsolidated coinvestment joint 

45 ventures during the second quarter of 2005 the increase in interest and other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and a 10 million other fee the 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of 1069 million using exchange rate in effect at contribution in operating properties to our newlyformed unconsolidated coinvestment joint venture amb japan fund i lp the 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of 715 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated coinvestment joint venture ambsgp mexico llc development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our developmentforsale program the increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005 during 2005 we sold five land parcels and five development projects aggregating approximately 09 million square feet for an aggregate price of 1552 million resulting in an aftertax gain of 451 million in addition during 2005 we received final proceeds of 78 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004 during 2005 we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture ambsgp mexico llc and recognized an aftertax gain of 19 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the thirdparty coinvestor for cash during 2004 we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our developmentforsale program aggregating approximately 03 million square feet for an aggregate price of 404 million resulting in an aftertax gain of 65 million during 2004 we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture ambsgp mexico llc and recognized an aftertax gain of 20 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the thirdparty coinvestor for cash

liquidity and capital resources 

  balance sheet strategy in general we use unsecured lines of credit unsecured notes preferred stock and common equity issued by us andor the operating partnership and its subsidiaries to capitalize our 100owned assets over time we plan to retire nonrecourse secured debt encumbering our 100owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes in managing our coinvestment joint ventures in general we use nonrecourse secured debt to capitalize our coinvestment joint ventures

  as of december 31 2005 the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was 19 billion excluding unamortized debt premiums of 120 million of the 19 billion of secured debt 14 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures the secured debt is generally nonrecourse and bears interest at rates varying from 06 to 104 per annum with a weighted average rate of 57 and final maturity dates ranging from january 2006 to january 2025 as of december 31 2005 16 billion of the secured debt obligations bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 63 while the remaining 2917 million bears interest at variable rates with a weighted average interest rate of 21 

  as of december 31 2005 the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of 9750 million in unsecured senior debt securities which bore a weighted average interest rate of 62 and had an average term of 52 years these unsecured senior debt securities include 3000 million in notes issued in june 1998 2500 million of mediumterm notes which were issued under the operating partnership’s 2000 mediumterm note program 3250 million of mediumterm notes which were issued under the operating partnership’s 2002 mediumterm note program and approximately 1125 million of 5094 notes due 2015 which were issued to teachers insurance and annuity association of america on july 11 2005 in a private placement in exchange for the cancellation of 100 million of notes that were issued in june 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately 125 million the unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants 

  we guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to its senior debt securities if we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase this increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

  credit facilities on june 1 2004 the operating partnership completed the early renewal of its senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of 5000 million we remain a guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations under the credit facility the threeyear credit facility includes a multicurrency component under which up to 2500 million can be drawn in yen euros or british pounds sterling the line which matures in june 2007 and carries a oneyear extension option can be increased up to 7000 million upon certain conditions and replaces the operating partnership’s previous 5000 million credit facility that was to mature in december 2005 the rate on the borrowings is generally libor plus a margin based on the operating partnership’s longterm debt rating which is currently 60 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points based on the current credit rating of the operating partnership’s longterm debt the operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions funding development activity and general working capital requirements the total amount available under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility which is generally based upon the value of our unencumbered properties as of december 31 2005 the outstanding balance on the credit facility was 2168 million and the remaining amount available was 2448 million net of outstanding letters of credit of 384 million excluding the additional 2000 million of potential additional capacity the outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in euros and yen which using the exchange rate in effect on december 31 2005 would equal approximately 1731 million and 437 million in us dollars respectively

53 any time to up to 350 billion yen which using the exchange rate in effect on december 31 2005 equaled approximately 2972 million us dollars and can be increased to up to 400 billion yen upon certain conditions we along with the operating partnership guarantee the obligations of amb japan finance yk under the revolving credit facility as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the revolving credit agreement the borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in japan generally borrowers under the revolving credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets the revolving credit facility matures in june 2007 and has a oneyear extension option which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 025 of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time the rate on the borrowings is generally tibor plus a margin which is based on the current credit rating of the operating partnership’s longterm debt and is currently 60 basis points in addition there is an annual facility fee payable in quarterly amounts which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s longterm debt and is currently 20 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of december 31 2005 the outstanding balance on this credit facility using the exchange rate in effect on december 31 2005 was 2058 million in us dollars 

  on november 24 2004 amb tokai tmk a japanese subsidiary of the operating partnership entered into a secured multiadvance project financing providing for loans in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 200 billion yen which using the exchange rate in effect on december 31 2005 would equal approximately 1699 million us dollars the financing agreement is among amb tokai tmk us the operating partnership sumitomo mitsui banking corporation and a syndicate of banks we along with the operating partnership jointly and severally guarantee amb tokai tmk’s obligations under the financing agreement pursuant to a guaranty of payment executed in connection with the project financing the financing is secured by a mortgage on certain real property located in tokai tokyo japan and matures on october 31 2006 with a oneyear extension option the rate on the borrowings will generally be tibor plus a margin which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s longterm debt and is currently 60 basis points per annum except that amb tokai tmk has purchased from sumitomo an interest rate swap which has fixed the interest rate payable on a principal amount equal to 130 billion yen at 132 per annum plus the applicable margin in addition there is an annual commitment fee based on unused commitments payable quarterly which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s longterm debt and is currently 20 basis points of the amount of unused commitments the financing agreement contains affirmative covenants including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios and negative covenants including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations in addition sumitomo amb tokai tmk and the operating partnership signed a commitment letter on november 24 2004 pursuant to which sumitomo committed to purchase bonds that may be issued by amb tokai tmk in an amount between 100 billion yen and 150 billion yen such amount to be determined by amb tokai tmk the bonds would be secured by the amb ohta distribution center and would generally accrue interest at a rate of tibor plus 110 per annum because the swap purchased by amb tokai tmk from sumitomo is coterminous with the maturity date of the proposed bonds amb tokai tmk will have fixed the interest rate payable on in general a principal amount equal to 130 billion yen at 242 per annum the bonds if issued would mature on october 31 2012 as of december 31 2005 the outstanding balance on this financing agreement was 195 billion yen which using the exchange rate in effect on december 31 2005 equaled approximately 1656 million us dollars and is accounted for as whollyowned secured debt

  as of december 31 2005 we had 2329 million in cash and cash equivalents and 3688 million of additional available borrowings under our credit facilities as of december 31 2005 we had 344 million in restricted cash 

  our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended december 31 2005 of 044 per share of common stock and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended december 31 2005 of 044 per common unit the dividends and distributions were payable on january 6 2006 to stockholders and unitholders of record on december 22 2005 the series l and m preferred stock dividends were payable on january 16 2006 to stockholders of record on january 6 2006 the series e f j and k preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on january 15 2006 the series o preferred stock dividends are payable on april 15 2006 the series d h i and n preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on december 25 2005 the following table sets forth the dividends and distributions paid or payable per share or unit for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

   the anticipated size of our distributions using only cash from operations will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due therefore we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings as well as property divestitures however we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would 

57 adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

capital commitments 

  developments in addition to recurring capital expenditures which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or retenant space during 2005 we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in north america europe and asia with a total estimated investment of 5224 million aggregating an estimated 70 million square feet as of december 31 2005 we had 47 projects in our development pipeline representing a total estimated investment of 11 billion upon completion of which two industrial projects with a total of 03 million square feet and an aggregate estimated investment of 245 million upon completion are held in unconsolidated joint ventures in addition we held one development project available for sale or contribution representing a total estimated investment of 328 million upon completion of the total development pipeline 6814 million had been funded as of december 31 2005 and an estimated 4052 million was required to complete current and planned projects we expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations borrowings under our credit facilities debt or equity issuances net proceeds from property divestitures and private capital from coinvestment partners which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow 

  acquisitions during 2005 we acquired 41 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 69 million square feet for a total expected investment of 5550 million including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated coinvestment joint ventures additional acquisition activity in 2005 included the purchase of an approximate 43 unconsolidated equity interest in gaccion one of mexico’s largest real estate companies for 461 million we generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions borrowings under our credit facility cash debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures 

  lease commitments we have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels primarily ontarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 57 years these operating lease payments are amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases future minimum rental payments required under noncancelable operating leases in effect as of december 31 2005 were as follows dollars in thousands 

   coinvestment joint ventures through the operating partnership we enter into coinvestment joint ventures with institutional investors these coinvestment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions development projects and renovation projects as well as private capital income as of december 31 2005 we had investments in coinvestment joint ventures with a gross book value of 25 billion which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and net equity investments in two unconsolidated coinvestment joint ventures of 263 million as of december 31 2005 we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned coinvestment joint ventures of up to 1337 million using the exchange rates at december 31 2005 from time to time we may raise additional equity commitments for amb institutional alliance fund iii lp an openended consolidated coinvestment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors which invest through a private real estate investment trust this would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund we are obligated to contribute 20 of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than 

58 1500 million at which time our obligation is reduced to 10 of the total equity commitments we expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations borrowings under our credit facilities debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures which could adversely effect our cash flow 

  captive insurance company in december 2001 we formed a whollyowned captive insurance company arcata national insurance ltd which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our thirdparty policies we capitalized arcata national insurance ltd in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements arcata national insurance ltd established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties annually we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs premiums paid to arcata national insurance ltd may be adjusted based on this estimate premiums paid to arcata national insurance ltd have a retrospective component so that if expenses including losses deductibles and reserves are less than premiums collected the excess may be returned to the property owners and in turn as appropriate to the customers and conversely subject to certain limitations if expenses including losses deductibles and reserves are greater than premiums collected an additional premium will be charged as with all recoverable expenses differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums are recognized in the subsequent year through this structure we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  standby letters of credit as of december 31 2005 we had provided approximately 487 million in letters of credit of which 384 million was provided under the operating partnership’s 5000 million unsecured credit facility the letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions bank guarantees and other commitments 

  guarantees as of december 31 2005  we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of 1282 million in connection with certain acquisitions as of december 31 2005 we guaranteed 234 million 

59 and 23 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and one of our unconsolidated joint ventures respectively 

  performance and surety bonds as of december 31 2005 we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of 09 million these bonds were issued in connection with certain of its development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure such as grading sewers and streets performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure 

  promoted interests and other contractual obligations upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events we may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us from time to time in the normal course of our business we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events 

supplemental earnings measures 

  ffo we believe that net income as defined by gaap is the most appropriate earnings measure however we consider funds from operations or ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance ffo is defined as net income calculated in accordance with gaap less gains or losses from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estaterelated depreciation and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of ffo of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures further we do not adjust ffo to eliminate the effects of nonrecurring charges we believe that ffo as defined by nareit is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization among other items from net income as defined by gaap we believe that the use of ffo combined with the required gaap presentations has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful we consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization ffo can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies 

  while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance ffo also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is ffo necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements further our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 

60   the following table reflects the calculation of ffo reconciled from net income for the years ended december 31 dollars in thousands 

 61  

   ss noi we believe that net income as defined by gaap is the most appropriate earnings measure however we consider same store net operating income ss noi to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance for properties that are considered part of the same store pool see part i item 2 “properties — industrial properties — industrial market operating statistics” note 5 and “operating and leasing statistics — industrial same store operating statistics” note 1 in deriving ss noi we define noi as rental revenues as calculated in accordance with gaap including reimbursements less straightline rents property operating expenses and real estate taxes we exclude straightline rents in calculating ss noi because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a yearoveryear comparison in addition we believe that ss noi helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate as compared to other companies 

  while ss noi is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance ss noi also does not reflect general and administrative expenses interest expenses depreciation and amortization costs capital expenditures and leasing costs or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations further our computation of ss noi may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating ss noi

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices interest rates and international exchange rates our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates accordingly we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service acquisitions capital expenditures distributions to stockholders and unitholders and other cash requirements the majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval thereby increasing our debt service obligations which could adversely affect our cash flows as of december 31 2005 we had two outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amount of 1195 million in us dollars see “financial instruments” below 

  the table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of 120 million as of december 31 2005 dollars in thousands 

  

   if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10 then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be 19 million annually as of december 31 2005 the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt both secured and unsecured was 34 billion based on our estimate of current market interest rates 

62   as of december 31 2005 and 2004 variable rate debt comprised 245 and 153 respectively of all our outstanding debt variable rate debt was 8317 million and 4983 million respectively as of december 31 2005 and 2004 the increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities this increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations 

  financial instruments we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income for revenues or expenses denominated in nonfunctional currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk our derivative financial instruments in effect at december 31 2005 were two interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on euribor europe and japanese tibor japan and two put options hedging against adverse foreign fluctuations of the mexican peso and the euro against the us dollar the following table summarizes our financial instruments as of december 31 2005 

   international operations our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk the us dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the united states and mexico the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside north america is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar translate their financial statements into us dollars assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement 

63 date we translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date the losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and totaled 18 million for year ended december 31 2005 

  our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency in these instances nonmonetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period for the year ended december 31 2005 gains from remeasurement and the sale of one foreign exchange agreement included in our results of operations totaled 06 million 

  we also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated we believe that these gains or losses are immaterial

   internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

operating strategy 

  we base our operating strategy on a variety of operational and service offerings including inhouse acquisitions development redevelopment asset management leasing finance accounting and market research our strategy is to leverage our expertise across a large customer base and complement our internal management resources with longstanding relationships with entrepreneurial real estate management and development firms in our target markets which we refer to as our strategic alliance partners ®  

  we believe that real estate is fundamentally a local business and best operated by local teams in each market comprised of amb employees local alliance partners or both we intend to increase utilization of internal management resources in target markets to achieve both operating efficiencies and to expose our customers to the broadening array of amb service offerings including access to multiple locations worldwide and buildtosuit developments we actively manage our portfolio whether directly or with an alliance partner by establishing leasing strategies negotiating lease terms pricing and level and timing of property improvements 

4   growth strategies 

   we seek to generate longterm internal growth through rent increases on existing space and renewals on rollover space by working to maintain a high occupancy rate at our properties and controlling expenses by capitalizing on the economies of scale inherent in owning operating and growing a large global portfolio however during 2004 our average industrial base rental rates decreased by 132 from the rent in place at expiration for that space on leases entered into or renewed during the period this amount excludes expense reimbursements rental abatements percentage rents and straightline rents since 2001 as the industrial market weakened we have focused on maintaining occupancy levels during 2004 cashbasis samestore net operating income rental revenues less property operating expenses and real estate taxes for properties included in the samestore pool which is set annually and excludes properties purchased or developments stabilized after december 31 2002 decreased by 09 on our industrial properties since our initial public offering in november 1997 we have experienced average annual increases in industrial base rental rates of 69 and maintained an average quarterend occupancy of 949 in our industrial operating portfolio while we believe that it is important to view real estate as a longterm investment past results are not necessarily an indication of future performance see part iv item 15 note 16 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for detailed segment information including revenue attributable to each segment gross investment in each segment and total assets 

   we believe that our significant acquisition experience and our network of property management and acquisition resources will continue to provide opportunities for external growth we have longterm relationships with thirdparty local property management firms which we believe will give us access to additional acquisition opportunities as such managers frequently market properties on behalf of sellers we believe that our operating structure also enables us to acquire properties through our upreit alliance program ® in exchange for limited partnership units in the operating partnership or amb property ii lp thereby enhancing our attractiveness to owners and developers seeking to transfer properties on a taxdeferred basis going forward we believe that our newlyformed openended coinvestment partnership amb institutional alliance fund iii lp will serve as our primary source of capital for acquisitions of operating properties within the us in addition we seek to redeploy capital from nonstrategic assets into properties that better fit our current investment focus 

  we are generally engaged in various stages of negotiations for a number of acquisitions and dispositions that may include transactions involving individual properties large multiproperty portfolios or other real estate companies there can be no assurance that we will consummate any of these transactions such transactions if we consummate them may be material individually or in the aggregate sources of capital for acquisitions may include retained cash flow from operations borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities other forms of secured or unsecured debt financing issuances of debt or preferred or common equity securities by us or the operating partnership including issuances of units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries proceeds from divestitures of properties assumption of debt related to the acquired properties and private capital from our coinvestment partners see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — summary of key transactions in 2004” 

   we believe that development renovation and expansion of welllocated highquality industrial properties should continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties we believe we have the inhouse expertise to create value both through new construction and acquisition conversion and management of valueadded properties valueadded conversion is typically characterized as property with available space or nearterm leasing exposure undeveloped land acquired in connection with other property that provides an opportunity for development or property that is welllocated but requires redevelopment or renovation both new development and value 

5   added conversions require significant management attention and capital investment to maximize returns completed development properties may be held in our portfolio sold to third parties or contributed to our coinvestment joint ventures we believe our global market presence and expertise will enable us to continue to generate and capitalize on a diverse range of development opportunities 

  we believe that the multidisciplinary backgrounds of our employees should provide us with the skills and experience to capitalize on strategic renovation expansion and development opportunities many of our officers have specific experience in real estate development both with us and with national development firms and over the past year we have expanded our development staff we pursue development projects directly and in joint ventures with our development alliance partners ®  which provides us with the flexibility to pursue development projects independently or in partnerships depending on market conditions submarkets or building sites 

   by 2007 we plan to have approximately 15 of our portfolio based on consolidated annualized base rent invested in international markets as of december 31 2004 our international operating properties comprised 44 of our consolidated annualized base rent our north american target markets outside of the united states currently include guadalajara mexico city monterrey and toronto our european target markets currently include amsterdam brussels frankfurt london lyon madrid and paris our asian target markets currently include beijing nagoya osaka the pearl river delta shanghai singapore and tokyo 

  we believe that expansion into target international markets represents a natural extension of our strategy to invest in industrial markets with high population densities close proximity to large customer clusters and available labor pools and major distribution centers serving global trade our international expansion strategy mirrors our domestic focus on supplyconstrained submarkets with political economic or physical constraints to new development our international investments will extend our offering of high throughput distribution ® facilities for customers who value speedtomarket over storage specifically we are focused on customers whose business is derived from global trade in addition our investments target major consumer distribution markets and customers we believe that our established customer relationships our contacts in the air cargo and logistics industries our underwriting of markets and investments and our strategic alliance programs with knowledgeable developers and managers will assist us in competing internationally 

  there are many factors that could cause our entry into target markets and future capital allocation to differ from our current expectations which are discussed in this report under the heading “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — business risks — risks associated with our international business” further it is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience market opportunities customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns for a discussion of the amount of our revenues attributable to the united states and international markets please see part iv item 15 note 16 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

   we coinvest in properties with privatecapital investors through partnerships limited liability companies or joint ventures our coinvestment joint ventures are managed by amb’s private capital group and typically operate under the same investment strategy that we apply to our other operations typically we will own a 2050 interest in our coinvestment joint ventures in general we control all significant operating and investment decisions of our coinvestment entities we believe that our coinvestment program will continue to serve as a source of capital for acquisitions and developments however there can be no assurance that it will continue to do so in addition our coinvestment joint ventures typically allow us to earn acquisition and development fees asset management fees and priority distributions as well as promoted interests and incentive fees based on the performance of the coinvestment joint ventures as of december 31 2004 we owned approximately 408 million square feet of our properties 368 of the total operating and development portfolio through our coinvestment joint ventures

 item 2 properties tableend industrial properties 

  as of december 31 2004 we owned 984 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 903 million rentable square feet located in 33 markets throughout the united states and in france germany japan mexico and the netherlands our industrial properties accounted for 5522 million or 993 of our total annualized base rent as of december 31 2004 our industrial properties were 948 leased to 2784 customers the largest of which accounted for no more than 34 of our annualized base rent from our industrial properties see part iv item 15 note 16 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” for segment information related to our operations 

  property characteristics our industrial properties which consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers are typically comprised of multiple buildings 

  the following table identifies type and characteristics of our industrial buildings and each type’s percentage of our total portfolio based on square footage at december 31 

   lease terms our industrial properties are typically subject to lease on a “triple net basis” in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes insurance and operating costs or are subject to leases on a “modified gross basis” in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels in addition most of our leases include fixed rental increases or consumer price index rental increases lease terms typically range from three to ten years with an average of six years excluding renewal options however the majority of our industrial leases do not include renewal options 

  overview of major target markets our industrial properties are typically located near major airports key interstate highways and seaports in major domestic metropolitan areas such as atlanta chicago dallas fort worth los angeles miami northern new jersey new york city the san francisco bay area and seattle our international industrial facilities are located in major distribution markets including amsterdam frankfurt guadalajara mexico city paris singapore and tokyo 

  within these metropolitan areas our industrial properties are generally concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established relatively large submarkets which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere these infill locations are typically near major airports seaports or convenient to major highways and rail lines and are 

7   proximate to large and diverse labor pools there is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrally located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses including warehouse distribution light assembly and manufacturing we generally avoid locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties

   as of december 31 2004 we held interests in joint ventures limited liability companies and partnerships with institutional investors and other third parties which we consolidate in our financial statements such investments are consolidated because we own a majority interest or as general partner exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as acquisition or disposition decisions approval of budgets selection of property managers and changes in financing under the agreements governing the joint ventures we and the other party to the joint venture may be required to make additional capital contributions and subject to certain limitations the joint ventures may incur additional debt such agreements also impose certain restrictions on the transfer of joint venture interests by us or the other party to the joint venture and typically provide certain rights to us or the other party to the joint venture to sell our or their interest in the joint venture to the joint venture or to the other jointventure partner on terms specified in the agreement in addition under certain circumstances many of the joint ventures include buysell provisions see part iv item 15 note 9 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional details

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

  you should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  we commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on november 26 1997 and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended december 31 1997 amb property corporation and amb property lp were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering 

management’s overview 

  we generate revenue and earnings primarily from rent received from customers under longterm generally three to ten years operating leases at our properties including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business we also derive earnings from the strategic disposition of assets and from the disposition of projects under our developmentforsale or contribution program our longterm growth is dependent on our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties and our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties 

  national industrial markets improved significantly during 2004 when compared with market conditions in 2003 the positive trend in demand began in the second quarter of 2004 and reversed 14 prior quarters of negatively trending or rising space availability we believe the protracted period of rising availability created a difficult leasing environment however investor demand for industrial property as evidenced by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates has remained consistently strong we believe we capitalized on the demand for acquisition property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio through the disposition of noncore properties we plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis but believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals property dispositions result in reinvestment capacity and trigger gainloss recognition but also create nearterm earnings dilution if the capital cannot be redeployed effectively we experienced such nearterm dilution in 2004 however we believe that the repositioning of our portfolio will benefit our stockholders in the longterm the table below summarizes our leasing activity for 2004 and 2003 

 25    

   we observed two positive trends nationally for industrial real estate during the year ended december 31 2004 supported by data provided by torto wheaton research first national industrial space availability declined 70 basis points during the year from 116 to 109 this decrease in national industrial space availability occurred in the last three quarters of 2004 reversing the trend of the prior 14 quarters in which national industrial space availability increased on average 36 basis points per quarter second national absorption of industrial space defined as the net change in occupied stock as measured by square feet of completions less the change in available square feet totaled approximately 175 million square feet in the year ended december 31 2004 substantially exceeding the 20 million square feet of space absorbed in 2003 and well above the tenyear historical average of 132 million square feet of space absorbed annually 

  in this improved environment our industrial portfolio’s occupancy levels increased to 948 at december 31 2004 from 931 at december 31 2003 which we believe reflects higher levels of demand for industrial space generally and in our portfolio specifically during the year ended december 31 2004 our lease expirations totaled approximately 214 million square feet while commencements of new or renewed leases totaled approximately 243 million square feet resulting in an increase in our occupancy level of approximately 170 basis points 

  rents on industrial renewals and rollovers in our portfolio decreased 132 during the year ended december 31 2004 as leases were entered into or renewed at rates consistent with what we believe to be current market levels we believe this decline in rents on lease renewals and rollovers reflects trends in national industrial space availability we believe that relatively high levels of national industrial space availability have caused market rents for industrial properties to decline between 10 and 20 from their peak levels in 2001 based on our research data 47 of the space that rolled over in our portfolio in 2004 had commenced between 1999 and 2001 rental rates in our portfolio declined at successively lower rates in each of the four quarters during 2004 which we believe indicates a stabilization of market rental rate levels while the level of rental rate reduction varied by market we achieved occupancy levels in our portfolio 570 basis points in excess of the national industrial market as determined by torto wheaton research by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions during periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new longerterm leases during periods of growing rental rates when we sign leases of shorter duration we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages appropriate to the lease term 

  we believe that development renovation and expansion of welllocated highquality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties we believe that our development opportunities in mexico and japan are attractive given the current lack of supply of modern distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries globally we have increased our development pipeline from a low of 1070 million at the end of 2002 to approximately 8287 million at december 31 2004 in addition to our committed development pipeline we hold a total of 1263 acres for future development or sale of which 1015 acres 199 acres 39 acres and ten acres in north america mexico asia and europe respectively could support an aggregate of approximately 222 million square feet of additional development 

  going forward we believe that our coinvestment program with privatecapital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for acquisitions and developments through these coinvestment joint ventures we typically earn acquisition and development fees asset management fees and priority distributions as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the coinvestment joint ventures however there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so through contribution of development properties to our coinvestment joint ventures we expect to recognize value 

26   creation from our development pipeline as of december 31 2004 we owned approximately 408 million square feet of our properties 368 of the total operating and development portfolio through our coinvestment joint ventures we may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so 

  by 2007 we plan to have approximately 15 of our portfolio based on consolidated annualized base rent invested in international markets our north american target markets outside of the united states currently include guadalajara mexico city monterrey and toronto our european target markets currently include amsterdam brussels frankfurt london lyon madrid and paris our asian target markets currently include beijing nagoya osaka the pearl river delta shanghai singapore and tokyo it is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience market opportunities customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns as of december 31 2004 our international operating properties comprised 44 of our consolidated annualized base rent 

  to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income as a result we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our ongoing operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can we must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs acquisitions and developments see “liquidity and capital resources” for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital 

summary of key transactions in 2004 

  during the year ended december 31 2004 we completed the following capital deployment transactions 

   see part iv item 15 notes 3 and 4 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition development and disposition activity 

  during the year ended december 31 2004 we completed the following capital markets and other financing transactions 

 27   

   see part iv item 15 notes 6 9 and 11 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions 

critical accounting policies 

  our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  investments in real estate investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value we also record at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for the value attributable to above or belowmarket leases inplace leases and lease origination costs for all acquisitions carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a propertybyproperty basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges are less than the carrying amount of the property the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital examples of certain situations that could affect future cash flows of a property may include but are not limited to significant decreases in occupancy unforeseen bankruptcy lease termination and moveout of a major customer or a significant decrease in annual base rents of that property if impairment analysis assumptions change then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our longlived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change to the extent that a property is impaired the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings 

28     revenue recognition we record rental revenue from operating leases on a straightline basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments if customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts security deposits and letters of credit then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable including straightline rents for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed we also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us if a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s occupancy 

  property dispositions we report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations first when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by thirdparty investors for cash second we dispose of valueadded conversion projects and buildtosuit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale the gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes when applicable lastly beginning in 2002 sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets required us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties the consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification there is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position net income or cash flows in all cases gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met 

  joint ventures we hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures our joint venture investments do not meet the variable interest entity criteria under fasb interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities therefore we determine consolidation based on standards set forth in eitf 9616 investor’s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights and statement of position 789 accounting for investments in real estate ventures based on the guidance set forth in these pronouncements we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets selection of property managers asset management investment activity and changes in financing for joint ventures where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions but where we exercise significant influence we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes 

  real estate investment trust as a real estate investment trust we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the us if we meet minimum distribution income asset and shareholder tests however some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes in addition foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country an income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable reit subsidiaries and international entities a deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in gaap versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition however we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet 

results of operations 

  the analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth acquisitions development activity and divestitures same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods excluding development properties prior to being stabilized subsequent to december 31 2002 

29   generally defined as properties that are 90 leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months 

  as of december 31 2004 same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 745 million square feet the properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings aggregating approximately 76 million square feet the properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings aggregating approximately 65 million square feet during 2004 property divestitures and contributions consisted of 29 industrial buildings two retail centers and one office aggregating approximately 44 million square feet in 2003 property divestitures consisted of 48 industrial buildings and two retail centers aggregating approximately 53 million square feet our future financial condition and results of operations including rental revenues may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results 

for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 dollars in millions 

   the decrease in us industrial same store rental revenues was primarily driven by decreased rental rates in various markets across the portfolio these and other factors accounted for approximately 69 million of the change from the prior year this decrease was partially offset by a decrease in allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately 33 million industrial same store occupancy was 953 at december 31 2004 and 930 at december 31 2003 for the year ended december 31 2004 rents in the same store portfolio decreased 147 on industrial renewals and rollovers cash basis on 162 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates the properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings aggregating approximately 65 million square feet the properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings aggregating approximately 76 million square feet other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties in 2003 and 2004 we continued to acquire properties in france germany japan mexico and the netherlands resulting in increased international industrial revenues the decrease in private capital income was due to greater incentive fees earned in the prior year 

30      same store properties’ operating expenses showed a decrease of 03 million from the prior year due to decreased nonreimbursable expenses the 2003 acquisitions consisted of 82 buildings aggregating approximately 65 million square feet the 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings aggregating approximately 76 million square feet other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties in 2003 and 2004 we continued to acquire properties in france germany japan mexico and the netherlands resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate the 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stockbased compensation expense of 23 million and additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives including our international and development expansions fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our coinvestment joint ventures the increase in fund costs was due to additional formation of coinvestment joint ventures in 2004 

   the 17 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to decreased occupancy at a property held by one of our joint ventures and increased nonreimbursable expenses 

31   this decrease was offset by the receipt of a lease termination fee at the abovementioned property in chicago in the first quarter of 2004 the gains from dispositions of real estate not classified as discontinued operations in 2004 resulted from our contribution of 715 million in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated coinvestment joint venture ambsgp mexico llc the gains from disposition of real estate not classified as discontinued operations in 2003 resulted from our contribution of 940 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated coinvestment joint venture industrial fund i llc the decrease in development profits net of taxes resulted from delayed gains on development sales the increase in interest expense including amortization was due to the issuance of additional unsecured debt under our 2002 mediumterm note program increased borrowings on the unsecured credit facilities and additional secured debt borrowings in our coinvestment joint ventures 

   during 2004 we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings two retail centers and one office building aggregating approximately 31 million square feet for an aggregate price of 2003 million with a resulting net gain of 420 million during 2003 we divested ourselves of 24 industrial buildings and two retail centers aggregating approximately 28 million square feet for an aggregate price of 2723 million with a resulting net gain of 429 million the decrease in income attributable to discontinued operations reflects the fact that properties were held for only a partial period in 2004 versus an entire year in 2003

   the increase in us industrial same store revenues were primarily driven by increased rental revenues in our ontarmac and los angeles markets these increases were partially offset by decreased rental income in our san francisco bay area market and an increase in our allowances for doubtful accounts of 40 million across the portfolio the properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings aggregating approximately 65 million square feet the development revenue increase reflects the timing of the stabilization of properties in the development pipeline other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties in 2003 we acquired properties in mexico and france resulting in increased international industrial revenues the increase in private capital income was primarily due to incentive distributions earned from amb partners ii lp 

 33     the 139 million increase in same store properties’ operating expenses was primarily due to increases in common area maintenance expenses of 120 million and real estate taxes of 29 million partially offset by a decrease in insurance expenses of 10 million the 2003 acquisitions consist of 82 buildings aggregating approximately 65 million square feet other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate partially offset by a reduction of 21 million for the recovery through the settlement of a lawsuit of capital expenditures paid in prior years the 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests the 2002 impairment included losses for lease cost writeoffs of 17 million and an impairment on a portion of our planned property contributions of 12 million the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stockbased compensation expense of 28 million partially offset by decreased personnel costs and taxes fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our coinvestment joint ventures 

   the decrease in interest and other income was primarily due to the repayment in full of a 740 million 95 mortgage note receivable in july 2002 gains from dispositions of real estate not classified as discontinued operations in 2003 resulted from our contribution of 940 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated coinvestment joint venture industrial fund i llc in february 2003 we recognized a gain of 74 million on the contribution representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the thirdparty investors for cash during 2002 we sold two industrial buildings and one retail center aggregating approximately 08 million square feet for an aggregate price of 506 million with a resulting loss of 08 million in june 2002 we also contributed 769 million in operating properties to our consolidated coinvestment joint venture ambsgp lp we recognized a gain of 33 million representing the sale of our interests in the properties acquired by the thirdparty investors for cash in november 2002 our joint venture partner in amb partners ii lp increased its ownership from 50 to 80 by acquiring 30 of the operating partnership’s interest in amb partners ii lp we recognized a gain of 63 million on the sale of the operating partnership’s 30 interest the increase in development profits net of taxes resulted from an increased sales volume of 578 million in 2003

  acquisitions during 2004 we acquired 64 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 76 million square feet for a total expected investment of 6952 million of which we acquired 48 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 42 million square feet through three of our coinvestment joint ventures for a total expected investment of 2610 million we generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions borrowings under our credit facilities cash debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures 

  lease commitments we have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels primarily ontarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from two to 58 years these operating lease payments are amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases future minimum rental payments required under noncancelable operating leases in effect as of december 31 2004 were as follows dollars in thousands 

   coinvestment joint ventures through the operating partnership we enter into coinvestment joint ventures with institutional investors these coinvestment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions development projects and renovation projects as well as private capital income as of december 31 2004 we had investments in coinvestment joint ventures with a gross book value of 26 billion which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and investments in an unconsolidated coinvestment joint venture of 95 million as of december 31 2004 we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned coinvestment joint ventures of up to 479 million from time to time we may raise additional equity commitments for amb institutional alliance fund iii lp an openended consolidated coinvestment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors which invest through a private real estate investment trust pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund we are obligated to contribute 20 of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than 150 million at which time our obligation is reduced to 10 of the total equity commitments we expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations borrowings under our credit facilities debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures which could adversely effect our cash flow 

  captive insurance company in december 2001 we formed a whollyowned captive insurance company arcata national insurance ltd which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our thirdparty policies we capitalized arcata national insurance ltd in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements arcata national insurance ltd established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties annually we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs premiums paid to arcata national insurance ltd may be adjusted based on this estimate premiums paid to arcata national insurance ltd have a retrospective component so that if expenses including losses and deductibles are less than premiums collected the excess may be returned to the property owners and in turn as appropriate to the customers and conversely subject to certain limitations if expenses including losses are greater than premiums collected an additional premium will be charged as with all recoverable expenses differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums are recognized in the subsequent year through this 

45   structure we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market 

  potential unknown liabilities unknown liabilities may include the following 

 overview of contractual obligations 

  the following table summarizes our debt interest and lease payments due by period as of december 31 2004 dollars in thousands 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

  standby letters of credit as of december 31 2004 we had provided approximately 336 million in letters of credit of which 139 million was provided under the operating partnership’s 5000 million unsecured credit facility the letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions bank guarantees and other commitments 

  guarantees other than parent guarantees associated with the unsecured debt of the operating partnership as of december 31 2004 we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of 347 million in connection with certain acquisitions and lease obligations of which 83 million was backed by standby letters of credit as of december 31 2004 we guaranteed 48 million on outstanding construction loans on two of our unconsolidated joint ventures additionally we provided a take out guarantee after the completion of construction on the aggregate construction loan amount of 302 million for another of our unconsolidated joint ventures of which 209 million was outstanding as of december 31 2004 in connection with this construction loan our joint venture partner provides an underlying construction loan guarantee up to the completion of construction 

  performance and surety bonds as of december 31 2004 we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of 12 million these bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure such as grading sewers and streets performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure 

  promoted interests and other contractual obligations upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events we may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us from time to 

46   time in the normal course of our business we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events 

supplemental earnings measures 

  ffo we believe that net income as defined by gaap is the most appropriate earnings measure however we consider funds from operations or ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance ffo is defined as net income calculated in accordance with gaap less gains or losses from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estaterelated depreciation and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of ffo of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures further we do not adjust ffo to eliminate the effects of nonrecurring charges we believe that ffo as defined by nareit is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization among other items from net income as defined by gaap we believe that the use of ffo combined with the required gaap presentations has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful we consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization ffo can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies 

  while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance ffo also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is ffo necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements further our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 

  the following table reflects the calculation of ffo reconciled from net income for the years ended december 31 dollars in thousands 

 47    48   business risks 

  our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to us these risks include among others 

general real estate industry risks 

   the investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the properties as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties if our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures then our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected in addition there are significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate such as mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs that generally do not decline when circumstances reduce the income from the property income from and the value of our properties may be adversely affected by 

   in addition periods of economic slowdown or recession in the united states and in other countries rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate or public perception that any of these events may occur would result in a general decrease in rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations future terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity which could reduce the demand for and the value of our properties to the extent that future attacks impact our customers their businesses similarly could be adversely affected including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases 

  our properties are concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector as a result of this concentration we would feel the impact of an economic downturn in this sector more acutely than if our portfolio included other property types 

   as of december 31 2004 leases on a total of 163 of our industrial properties based on annualized base rent will expire on or prior to december 31 2005 we derive most of our income from rent received from our customers accordingly our financial condition results of operations cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew these expiring leases if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected if a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other type of financial distress then it may be unable to make timely rental payments or renew its lease further our ability to rent space and the rents that we can charge are impacted not only by customer demand but by the number of other properties we have to compete with to appeal to customers 

49   

   we compete with other developers owners and operators of real estate some of which own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located if our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants we may lose potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants’ leases expire as a result our financial condition cash flow cash available for distribution trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected 

   real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of assets further as a real estate investment trust the internal revenue code regulates the number of properties that we can dispose of in a year their tax bases and the cost of improvements that we make to the properties in addition a portion of the properties held directly or indirectly by certain of our subsidiary partnerships were acquired in exchange for limited partnership units in the applicable partnership the contribution agreements for such properties may contain restrictions on certain sales exchanges or other dispositions of these properties or a portion thereof that result in a taxable transaction for specified periods following the contribution of these properties to the applicable partnership these limitations may affect our ability to sell properties this lack of liquidity and the internal revenue code restrictions may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and as a result could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

we could be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants are unable to meet their lease obligations 

  our results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of our common stock would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their lease obligations to us in the event of a significant number of lease defaults our cash flow may not be sufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders and repay maturing debt as of december 31 2004 we did not have any single tenant account for annualized base rent revenues greater than 34 however in the event of lease defaults by a significant number of our tenants we may incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord 

we may be unable to consummate acquisitions on advantageous terms or acquisitions may not perform as we expect 

  we acquire and intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties the acquisition of properties entails various risks including the risks that our investments may not perform as we expect that we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate our new acquisitions into our existing operations and that our cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate further we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other wellcapitalized real estate investors including both publiclytraded real estate investment trusts and private institutional investment funds this competition increases as investments in real estate become increasingly attractive relative to other forms of investment as a result of competition we may be unable to acquire additional properties as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly elevated in addition we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership or its subsidiaries and proceeds from property divestitures which may not be available and which could adversely affect our cash flow any of the above risks could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

50   we may be unable to complete renovation and development projects on advantageous terms 

  as part of our business we develop new and renovate existing properties the real estate development and renovation business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock which include 

 risks associated with our international business 

   we have acquired and developed and expect to continue to acquire and develop properties in international countries because local markets affect our operations our international investments are subject to economic fluctuations in the international locations in which we invest in addition our international operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations including those governing the taxation of our international revenues restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world property rights uncertainty and political instability we cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur further we have entered and may in the future enter into agreements with nonus entities that are governed by the laws of and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of another country or region we cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise and even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis or at all 

  further our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through international property acquisitions and developments if we fail to effectively manage our international growth then our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected 

   we have acquired and may continue to acquire properties in international markets that are new to us when we acquire properties located in these markets we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures we work to mitigate such risks through extensive diligence and research and associations with experienced partners however there can be no guarantee that all such risks will be eliminated 

51   

   we are pursuing and intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets as we invest in countries where the us dollar is not the national currency we are subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the currencies of those other countries a significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations we attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing under our multicurrency credit facility in the currency of the country we are investing in and under certain circumstances by putting in place international currency put option contracts hedging exchange rate fluctuations for leases denominated in international currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international exchange risk we cannot however assure you that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks if we do engage in international currency exchange rate hedging activities any income recognized with respect to these hedges as well as any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 

our performance and value are impacted by the local economic conditions of and the risks associated with doing business in california 

  as of december 31 2004 our industrial properties located in california represented 270 of the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating properties and 278 of our industrial annualized base rent our revenue from and the value of our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california’s economic climate because of the number of properties we have located in california a downturn in california’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

we may experience losses that our insurance does not cover 

  we carry commercial liability property and rental loss insurance covering all the properties that we own and manage in types and amounts that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risks applicable to the property the cost of coverage and industry practice certain losses such as those due to terrorism windstorms floods or seismic activity may be insured subject to certain limitations including large deductibles or copayments and policy limits although we have obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism with policy specifications and insured limits that we consider commercially reasonable given the cost and availability of such coverage we cannot be certain that we will be able to renew coverage on comparable terms or collect under such policies in addition there are other types of losses such as those from riots bioterrorism or acts of war that are not generally insured in our industry because it is not economically feasible to do so we may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds our insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and if there is recourse debt then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties moreover as the general partner of the operating partnership we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnership’s unsatisfied recourse obligations including any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of coinvestment joint ventures any such losses could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

  a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity domestic properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the san francisco bay area los angeles memphis and seattle our largest concentration of such properties is in california where as of 

52   december 31 2004 we had 289 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 244 million square feet and representing 270 of our industrial operating properties based on aggregate square footage and 278 based on industrial annualized base rent international properties located in active seismic areas include tokyo and osaka japan and mexico city mexico we carry replacementcost earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants 

we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties owned through joint ventures limited liability companies and partnerships 

  as of december 31 2004 we owned approximately 556 million square feet of our properties through several joint ventures limited liability companies or partnerships with third parties our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships limited liability companies or joint ventures and we intend to continue to develop and acquire properties through joint ventures limited liability companies and partnerships with other persons or entities when warranted by the circumstances such partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions partnership limited liability company or joint venture investments involve certain risks including 

   we generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships limited liability companies and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives however we may not be able to do so and the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

we may be unable to complete divestitures on advantageous terms or contribute properties 

  we intend to continue to divest ourselves of properties that do not meet our strategic objectives provided that we can negotiate acceptable terms and conditions our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors beyond our control including competition from other sellers and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of our properties if we are unable to dispose of properties on favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy then our 

53   financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected 

  we also anticipate contributing or selling properties to funds and joint ventures if we do not have sufficient properties available that meet the investment criteria of current or future property funds or if the funds have reduced or no access to capital on favorable terms then such contributions or sales could be delayed or prevented adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 

  we have and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties then we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it which could adversely affect our cash flow unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include 

 we are dependent on external sources of capital 

  in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our real estate investment trust taxable income determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain and are taxed on our income to the extent it is not fully distributed consequently we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including acquisition and development activities from cash retained from operations and must rely on thirdparty sources of capital further in order to maintain our reit status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments our ability to access private debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our capital stock 

debt financing risks 

   it is our policy to incur debt either directly or through our subsidiaries only if it will not cause our share of total debttoour share of total market capitalization ratio to exceed approximately 45 our definition of “our share of total market capitalization” is our share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity see footnote 1 to the capitalization ratio table contained in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation — liquidity and capital resources” for our definition of “market equity” and footnote 2 to such table for our definition of “our share of total debt” the aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy increases directly with an increase in the market price per share of our capital stock further our management could alter or eliminate this policy without stockholder approval if we change this policy then we could become 

54   more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders 

   as of december 31 2004 we had total debt outstanding of 33 billion we guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest we anticipate that we will repay only a small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity accordingly we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt if we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase 

  in addition if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value a foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

   the terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit flexibility in our operations and our failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied our payment obligations as of december 31 2004 we had certain nonrecourse secured loans which are crosscollateralized by multiple properties if we default on any of these loans we may then be required to repay such indebtedness together with applicable prepayment charges to avoid foreclosure on all the crosscollateralized properties within the applicable pool foreclosure on our properties or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock in addition our credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain crossdefault provisions which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default these crossdefault provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock 

   we seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements these agreements involve risks such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations 

55   conflicts of interest risks 

   certain of our executive officers and directors own interests in other realestate related businesses and investments including retail development projects office buildings and de minimis holdings of the equity securities of public and private real estate companies our executive officers’ continued involvement in other real estaterelated activities could divert their attention from our daytoday operations our executive officers have entered into noncompetition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities directly or indirectly in respect of commercial real estate and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate other than through ownership of not more than 5 of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through the existing investments referred to in this report state law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements we believe that these properties and activities generally do not directly compete with any of our properties however it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director or an affiliate of an executive officer or director has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property we will not acquire any properties from our executive officers directors or their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and independent as defined by the rules of the new york stock exchange members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction 

   as the general partner of the operating partnership we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnership’s limited partners the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders in addition those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the operating partnership’s partnership agreement and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights the limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders in addition under the terms of the operating partnership’s partnership agreement holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders 

risks associated with government regulations 

   under various environmental laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at on under or in its property the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial these laws typically impose liability and cleanup responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination 

  environmental laws in some countries including the us also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and 

56   may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos some of our properties may contain asbestoscontaining building materials 

  in addition some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances further certain of our properties are on adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or upon which others have engaged are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in properties with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return in such an instance we underwrite the costs of environmental investigation cleanup and monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate environmental insurance for the property further in connection with certain divested properties we have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties 

  at the time of acquisition we subject all of our properties to a phase i or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants and we may have additional phase ii testing performed upon consultant’s recommendation these environmental assessments have not revealed and we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole nonetheless it is possible that the assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities unknown to us or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are greater than we anticipated further our properties’ current environmental condition may be affected by customers the condition of land operations in the vicinity of the properties such as releases from underground storage tanks or by unrelated third parties if the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items then our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected 

   under the americans with disabilities act places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants if we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the americans with disabilities act including removing access barriers then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected our properties are also subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and lifesafety requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements while we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

federal income tax risks 

   we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1997 we currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust however it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate 

57   investment trust or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control for example in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust we must derive at least 95 of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources in addition we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our real estate investment trust taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis these provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification however we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust 

  if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year then we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost qualification if we lose our real estate investment trust status then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders 

   from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are treated as prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions while we believe that the internal revenue service would not prevail in any such dispute if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes 

risks associated with our dependence on key personnel 

  we depend on the efforts of our executive officers while we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 

risks associated with our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

   the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations as part of management’s ongoing 

58   review of our accounting policies and internal control over financial reporting on october 12 2004 management determined that there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to ground lease depreciation this weakness resulted in an understatement of depreciation expense and resulted in a restatement of depreciation expense for our results in previously issued financial statements for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 and for the quarters ended march 31 2004 and june 30 2004 in connection with correcting this error management modified our system of internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weakness as of december 31 2004 management had appropriately remediated this issue and the material weakness no longer existed while management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time other deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations restatements of our financial statements a decline in our stock price or otherwise materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operation financial condition or liquidity 

risks associated with ownership of our stock 

   certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay defer or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for the common stock to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made furthermore our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12month taxable year or a proportionate part of a short tax year in addition if we or an owner of 10 or more of our stock actually or constructively owns 10 or more of one of our customers or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner then the rent received by us either directly or through any such partnership from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the internal revenue code to help us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes we prohibit the ownership actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the internal revenue code by any single person of more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our common stock series l preferred stock and series m preferred stock we also prohibit the ownership actually or constructively of any shares of our series d e f h i j and k preferred stock by any single person so that no such person taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person including any common stock or other series of preferred stock may own in excess of 98 of our issued and outstanding capital stock we refer to this limitation as the “ownership limit” shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale a transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances the ownership limit may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control and therefore could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction 

  our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction including a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

59     our charter and bylaws and maryland law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors which in turn may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control those provisions in our charter and bylaws include 

   those provisions provided for under maryland law include 

   in addition our board could elect to adopt without stockholder approval certain other provisions under maryland law that may impede a change in control 

   as with other publicly traded securities the trading price of our stock will depend on many factors that are not within our control and may change from time to time including 

   other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future trading price of our stock 

   as a real estate investment trust the market value of our equity securities in general is based primarily upon the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends our equity securities’ market value is based secondarily upon the market value of our underlying real estate assets for this reason shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not 

60   correspondingly increase the market price of our stock our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock further the distribution yield on the stock as a percentage of the price of the stock relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of our stock an increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield which would adversely affect our stock’s market price additionally if the market price of our stock declines significantly then we might breach certain covenants with respect to our debt obligations which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 

   we have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities and to cause the operating partnership to issue limited partnership units in exchange for property or otherwise existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by the operating partnership or us and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholder’s investment 

   subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances our board of directors determines our investment and financing policies our growth strategy and our debt capitalization distribution and operating policies although our board of directors does not presently intend to revise or amend these strategies and policies they may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 

   the operating partnership and amb property ii lp had 4746104 common limited partnership units issued and outstanding as of december 31 2004 which may be exchanged generally one year after their issuance on a oneforone basis into shares of our common stock in the future the operating partnership or amb property ii lp may issue additional limited partnership units and we may issue shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of properties or in private placements these shares of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets over time pursuant to registration rights that we have granted or may grant in connection with future issuances or pursuant to rule 144 in addition common stock issued under our stock option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that we have filed or pursuant to rule 144 as of december 31 2004 under our stock option and incentive plans we had 5103927 shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance including cancellations and forfeitures had outstanding options to purchase 10220631 shares of common stock net of cancellations and forfeitures and 2447390 shares that we have issued upon the exercise of options and had 1178052 restricted shares of common stock outstanding net of 75988 shares that have been forfeited future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock further the existence of the operating partnership’s limited partnership units and the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the exercise of options and registration rights referred to above may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices interest rates and international exchange rates our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates accordingly we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating investing and financing 

61   activities with projected cash outflows for debt service acquisitions capital expenditures distributions to stockholders and unitholders and other cash requirements the majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval thereby increasing our debt service obligations which could adversely affect our cash flows as of december 31 2004 we had two outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amount of 1371 million in us dollars see financial instruments disclosure below 

  the table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of 108 million as of december 31 2004 dollars in thousands 

  

   if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased by 10 then the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be 11 million annually as of december 31 2004 the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt both secured and unsecured was 34 billion based on our estimate of current market interest rates 

  as of december 31 2004 and 2003 variable rate debt comprised 153 and 147 respectively of all our outstanding debt variable rate debt was 4983 million and 3780 million respectively as of december 31 2004 and 2003 the increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities this increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations 

  financial instruments we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income for revenues or expenses denominated in nonfunctional currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk our derivative financial instruments in effect at december 31 2004 were two put options buy usdsell mxn hedging against adverse currency exchange fluctuations of the mexican peso against the us dollar and two interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on

   international operations our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk the us dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the united states and mexico the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside north america is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located mitigating the effect of currency exchange gains and losses our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar translate their financial statements into us dollars assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date we translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and totaled 04 million for the year ended december 31 2004 

  our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency in these instances nonmonetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period for the year ended december 31 2004 gains from remeasurement included in our statements of operations were 05 million 

  we also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated we believe that these gains and losses are immaterial

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend restatement of depreciation expense 

  on october 12 2004 we announced a restatement of depreciation expense for our prior period results relating to 39 buildings in our portfolio 38 of which are located ontarmac which is land owned by federal state or local airport authorities as part of management’s ongoing review of our accounting policies and internal control over financial reporting management determined that we should have depreciated certain of our investments in buildings that reside on land subject to ground leases over the remaining terms of the ground leases rather than over 40 years which is the period used to depreciate buildings that we hold in fee simple management determined that the cause for this depreciation error was that there was no mechanism in place to segregate and apply appropriate depreciable lives to assets subject to ground leases our general ledger did not have a separate account designation for assets subject to ground leases so these assets were not segregated into a separate expected useful life category for depreciation purposes 

  management also determined that the internal control deficiency that resulted in this restatement represented a material weakness as defined by the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 2 the public company accounting oversight board has defined material weakness as “a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected” our conclusion that the control deficiencies surrounding ground lease depreciation constituted a material weakness means that there was a more than remote likelihood of a material misstatement in our financial statements for future periods as of december 31 2004 management had appropriately remediated this issue and the material weakness no longer existed 

  these assets are now depreciated over the lesser of 40 years or the contractual term of the underlying ground lease in connection with correcting the depreciation error management modified our system of internal control over financial reporting to remediate this internal control deficiency specifically we implemented the following remediation measures with respect to this material weakness 

   management restated our consolidated financial statements contained in our annual report on form 10k and amendment no 1 to our annual report on form 10ka for the year ended december 31 2003 originally filed with the us securities and exchange commission on march 11 2004 and march 15 2004 respectively and our quarterly reports on forms 10qa for the quarters ended march 31 2004 and 

64   june 30 2004 originally filed with the us securities and exchange commission on may 7 2004 and august 6 2004 respectively management and the audit committee of our board of directors discussed with our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp and determined that this was the proper approach 

disclosure controls and procedures and changes to internal control over financial reporting 

  as required by rule 13a15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer president and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures that were in effect as of the end of the year covered by this report our chief executive officer president and chief financial officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2004 in light of the implementation of the new remediation measures described above the chief executive officer president and chief financial officer believe that management appropriately modified our internal control over financial reporting relating to ground lease depreciation and remediated the material weakness as of december 31 2004 the changes in our internal control over financial reporting discussed above materially affected our internal control over financial reporting 

  except as stated above there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the chief executive officer president and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

   internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

  our management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “internal control — integrated framework” published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on our evaluation under the 

65   framework in “internal control — integrated framework” our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2004 

  our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 has been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp as stated in their report which appears herein

 item 1 business prologis   prologis collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries and partnerships “prologis” is a real estate investment trust “reit” that operates a global network of industrial distribution properties prologis’ business strategy is designed to achieve longterm sustainable growth in cash flow and increase the overall return on equity for its shareholders prologis manages its business by utilizing the prologis operating system® an organizational structure and service delivery system that prologis built around its customers when combined with prologis’ international network of distribution properties the prologis operating system enables prologis to meet its customers’ distribution space needs on a global basis prologis believes that by integrating international scope and expertise with a strong local presence in its markets it has become an attractive choice for the largest global users of distribution space its targeted customer base   prologis is organized under maryland law and has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” prologis’ world headquarters and north american customer service headquarters are located in aurora colorado prologis’ european headquarters are located in luxembourg while its european customer service headquarters are located in amsterdam the netherlands prologis’ asian headquarters are located in tokyo japan prologis’ common shares of beneficial interest par value 001 per share “common shares” were first listed on the new york stock exchange “nyse” in march 1994   this report on form 10k includes certain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in global economic business competitive market and regulatory factors see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk factors”   a copy of this annual report on form 10k as well as prologis’ quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to such reports are available free of charge on the internet in the investor relations section of prologis’ website all required reports are made available on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission the “sec” prologis’ website address is wwwprologiscom the reference to prologis’ website address does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained in the website and such information should not be considered to be part of this document 

 

   prologis was formed in 1991 with the primary objective of creating an operating company in the united states that would differentiate itself from its competition through its ability to meet a corporate customer’s distribution space requirements on a national regional and local basis with the added benefit of providing consistent levels of service throughout the country prologis’ initial business strategy involved the acquisition and development of industrial distribution properties that it would operate and lease to customers in the united states these properties represented one operating segment — the property operations segment — as prologis’ intent was and continues to be to hold certain investments on a longterm basis while generating income from leasing the properties to customers   an integral part of prologis’ customer service focus has always been to have a portfolio of properties that meets the distribution space needs of its existing customers as well as meeting the needs of targeted national and international companies as distribution space users expanded and managed their businesses for greater profitability their distribution networks expanded and were reconfigured including their distribution networks outside of the united states in order to meet the growing distribution space needs of these companies prologis expanded its operations to mexico in 1996 to europe in 1997 and to japan in 2001 in april 2003 1 prologis opened a representative office in shanghai china to evaluate opportunities to initially serve customers in three targeted areas of china guangdong province and the shanghai and beijing regions 

  in 1995 prologis expanded its business to include the corporate distribution facilities services “cdfs business” operating segment the cdfs business segment began utilizing prologis’ existing development capabilities which had been focused only on the development of properties for direct longterm investment to develop properties for sale to third parties as with prologis’ property operations segment the cdfs business segment operated initially only in the united states in 1998 prologis expanded its cdfs business segment activities to europe to complement its european property operations the acquisition of an established industrial development business in the united kingdom in august 1998 provided prologis with access to strategic land positions in a country where previously it had only limited investments and where significant barriers for initial startup activities existed with both property operations and cdfs business segments in operation in the united kingdom and continental europe prologis was positioned to be a singlesource paneuropean provider of distribution space to global users   because prologis as a reit must distribute rather than reinvest substantial amounts of its internally generated capital it must find public or private sources of capital to fund development activities and to grow its portfolio sales of properties to third parties in the cdfs business segment enabled prologis to begin recycling capital to fund some of its future development activities this ability to recycle funds in the cdfs business segment became a more integral part of prologis’ business strategy in early 1999 when the public equity markets became an increasingly costly method of raising capital as such it was necessary for prologis to increase the volume of its cdfs business segment transactions so that it could selffund its development activities therefore prologis shifted the focus of its cdfs business segment from developing and selling properties to third parties to developing properties that would be contributed to property funds — property funds that would be formed by prologis by accessing private equity capital and that would be managed by prologis and to supplement the private equity investments in each property fund the property funds were positioned to obtain secured debt financing by using their properties as security today the property funds’ leverage ratios typically range from 40 to 75   the first property fund was formed in august 1999 primarily with operating properties from prologis’ property operations segment however the formation of prologis european properties fund in september 1999 embodied prologis’ overall property fund strategy that i allows prologis to realize for financial reporting purposes a portion of the development profits from its cdfs business activities by contributing its developed properties to a property fund profits are recognized to the extent of third party investment in the property fund ii provides a source of private capital to prologis iii allows prologis to maintain a longterm ownership position in the properties and iv allows prologis as the manager of the property fund to maintain the market presence and customer relationships that are the key drivers of the prologis operating system five of prologis’ property funds all in the united states were formed with a specific amount of private capital that allowed the property fund to generally make one portfolio acquisition from prologis in addition to its ownership positions prologis provides these property funds with management services three property funds one each in north america europe and japan were formed with third party capital commitments that are available to the property fund over time to allow these property funds to acquire properties as prologis’ cdfs business segment makes them available   prologis’ business strategy has evolved to fit the environment in which it operates the primary driver in this evolution has been prologis’ focus on its customers’ needs for distribution space after 12 years in operation that focus has enabled prologis to become a leading global provider of distribution space operating on three continents 2 

prologis’ operating segments   prologis’ business is organized into two operating segments property operations and the cdfs business 

 

 

 

   the property operations segment represents the longterm ownership management and leasing of industrial distribution properties prologis’ property operations segment at december 31 2003 including assets owned by eight property funds in which prologis has ownership interests consisted of 1737 operating properties aggregating 2304 million square feet in north america the united states and mexico 11 countries in europe and in japan prologis presents its investments in the property funds under the equity method of the total operating properties prologis directly owned 1252 operating properties aggregating 1331 million square feet prologis’ ownership interests in its eight property funds ranged from 14 to 50 at december 31 2003 prologis’ investment strategy in the property operations segment focuses primarily on generic industrial distribution properties in key distribution markets   prologis develops distribution properties in its other operating segment the cdfs business segment with the intent to contribute the property to a property fund or to sell the property to a third party also in the cdfs business segment prologis acquires properties with the intent to contribute them to a property fund generally after rehabilitation andor repositioning activities have been completed these properties along with their operations are included in the property operations segment after they are completed or acquired through the date they are contributed or sold the gains and losses realized from the contributions or sales of these properties are included in the cdfs business segment’s income because they were developed or acquired in that segment at december 31 2003 there were 119 cdfs business segment operating properties aggregating 204 million square feet at a total investment of 9283 million that were included in the property operations segment’s investments on an interim basis   property operations segment investment activities in 2003 included    see “item 2 properties — properties” “item 2 properties — unconsolidated investees — property operations” and notes 4 and 10 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

   the property operations segment generates income from rents and reimbursements of property operating expenses from unaffiliated customers who lease prologis’ distribution space also the operating income of the 3 property operations segment includes prologis’ proportionate shares of the net earnings or losses of the property funds recognized under the equity method along with the fee income that prologis earns for managing the properties owned by the property funds in addition to property and asset management fees prologis also earns fees for performing other services to the property funds including but not limited to development leasing and acquisition activities 

  the net earnings or losses generated by operating properties developed or acquired in the cdfs business segment that are included in the property operations segment on an interim basis prior to their contribution or sale are also included in the operating income of the property operations segment the resulting gains or losses from the contributions or sales of these properties are included in the operating income of the cdfs business segment   in 2003 2002 and 2001 the property operations segment’s operating income was 4807 million 4776 million and 4775 million respectively see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — property operations” and note 10 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8   operational information about this operating segment for 2003 includes  4 

 

   prologis has generally invested in distribution markets in north america europe and japan in which it has identified strong distribution dynamics as well as supply and demand factors in making its investment decisions prologis evaluates market conditions that indicate favorable distribution growth prospects including but not limited to i growth in imports and exports ii longterm cost and quality of labor advantages for domestic and international manufacturers iii proximity to large regional and local population centers with good access to transportation networks iv expansion and contraction needs of distribution space users located in the market and v an historically high ratio of distribution space per capita   prologis assesses its market presence not only in terms of its investments in the market but also by the extent it has developed relationships with customers that have distribution space requirements in such markets prologis believes it can maintain these relationships by offering operating properties that are functional and costeffective complemented by a comprehensive level of customer service prologis believes that by being a significant local owner and developer in multiple markets it has the ability to increase customer retention because it can meet its customers’ needs to either expand or contract through its network of distribution properties and land positions this network allows prologis to retain the customer by relocating the customer within its existing inventory of distribution space or readily developing a new property for the customer   at december 31 2003 the 1252 properties aggregating 1331 million square feet in the property operations segment that are owned directly by prologis are located in 37 markets in the united states four markets in mexico and 16 markets in seven countries in europe all of prologis’ operating properties in japan are owned by a property fund prologis’ largest markets in the united states based on investment in directly owned properties are atlanta chicago dallas fort worth houston and san francisco both south bay and east bay markets prologis also has large holdings in several markets in the united kingdom see “item 2 properties — geographic distribution” and “item 2 properties — properties”   the operating properties owned by the property funds at december 31 2003 were as follows square feet in thousands   5   see “item 2 properties — geographic distribution” for a discussion of prologis’ defined markets and “item 2 properties — unconsolidated investees — property operations” for additional information on the operating properties owned by the property funds 

 

   in general numerous other industrial distribution properties are located in close proximity to prologis’ properties the amount of rentable distribution space available in any market could have a material effect on prologis’ ability to rent space and on the rents that prologis can charge in addition in many of prologis’ submarkets institutional investors and owners and developers of industrial distribution properties including other reits compete for the acquisition development and leasing of distribution space many of these entities have substantial resources and experience competition in acquiring existing distribution properties and land both from institutional capital sources and from other reits has been very strong over the past several years 

 

   prologis’ business strategy includes a customer service focus that requires prologis to provide responsive professional and effective property management services at the local level to enhance its management services prologis has developed and implemented proprietary operating and training systems to achieve consistent levels of performance and professionalism in all markets and to enable its property management team members to give the proper level of attention to prologis’ customers throughout its network prologis manages substantially all of its directly owned operating properties and all of the operating properties owned by the property funds 

 

   prologis has sought to develop a customer base in each market that is diverse in terms of industry concentration and that represents a broad spectrum of international national regional and local distribution space users at december 31 2003 prologis and the property funds had 3785 customers occupying 2038 million square feet of distribution space including customers leasing space in properties owned by the property funds the largest customer and the 25 largest customers accounted for 238 and 218 respectively of the annualized collected base rents of prologis and the property funds at december 31 2003 when the customers leasing space in the properties owned by the property funds are excluded prologis’ largest customer and its 25 largest customers accounted for 121 and 152 respectively of prologis’ annualized collected base rents at december 31 2003 

 

   prologis directly employs approximately 725 persons prologis’ employees work in north america approximately 460 persons in nine countries in europe approximately 240 persons and in asia primarily in japan approximately 25 persons of the total approximately 350 employees are assigned to the property operations segment prologis’ other employees may assist with property operations segment activities prologis believes that its relationships with its employees are good prologis’ employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 

 

   the demand for industrial distribution space is not seasonal 

 

   prologis believes that its current level of direct investment in the property operations segment enables it to serve its customers at a high level and increase returns to its shareholders prologis’ business plan with respect to direct investments in the property operations segment allows for the expansion of its network of operating properties on a limited basis and only as necessary to i address the specific expansion needs of a 6 customer ii enhance its market presence in a specific country market or submarket or iii take advantage of opportunities where prologis believes it has the ability to achieve favorable returns 

  prologis plans to continue with its current business strategy with respect to the growth in assets held by property funds prologis expects to achieve this growth primarily through the property funds’ acquisition of properties developed or acquired by prologis in the cdfs business segment but also by their direct acquisition of properties from third parties prologis expects that the fee income it earns from the property funds will increase in 2004 over the 2003 levels as the sizes of the portfolios of operating properties in the property funds increase also depending on capital availability the number of property funds could increase in 2004 properties contributed to property funds must generally meet certain leasing criteria prologis observed a slowing in its customers’ decision making processes and in overall leasing activity in 2003 that it believes were primarily the result of weak economic conditions in the united states and certain western european countries prologis’ business plan for 2004 with respect to property fund contributions does not anticipate a significant improvement in prevailing economic conditions however prologis’ market research and customer feedback indicates that the consolidation and reconfiguration of distribution networks in europe and japan have been and will continue to be key drivers in leasing decisions prologis believes that being a singlesource provider of stateoftheart distribution properties in europe and japan positions it to take advantage of these trends to the extent they continue in 2004   prologis intends to fund its investment activities in the property operations segment in 2004 with operating cash flow from this operating segment its shortterm borrowing facilities and the proceeds from contributions and sales of properties properties that have been directly owned longterm investments in the property operations segment as well as cdfs business segment properties that are included in the property operations segment on an interim basis prior to their contribution or sale   see the discussion of factors that could affect the future plans of prologis and the property funds in the property operations segment at “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk factors” 

 

   the cdfs business segment encompasses those activities that prologis engages in that are not primarily associated with the longterm ownership management and leasing of industrial distribution properties within this operating segment prologis develops distribution properties that are either contributed to property funds or sold to third parties and acquires distribution properties that are contributed to property funds properties that are acquired by prologis in this segment are generally rehabilitated andor repositioned prior to their contribution to a property fund 

 

   at december 31 2003 prologis had 27 distribution properties aggregating 98 million square feet under development at a total expected cost at completion of 6785 million these properties are all being developed with the objective that they will be contributed to a property fund or sold to a third party prologis’ properties under development at december 31 2003 include    at december 31 2003 prologis had land positions including land controlled through contracts options or letters of intent aggregating 4549 acres with the capacity for the development of approximately 768 million square feet of distribution properties of these land positions prologis owned 2706 acres with the 7 capacity for the development of approximately 482 million square feet of distribution properties at december 31 2003 prologis had begun development on all of its land holdings in japan prologis’ land positions owned and under control at december 31 2003 included 

   cdfs business segment investment activities in 2003 included the following      

 

   the operating income of the cdfs business segment consists primarily of the net gains and losses recognized from the contributions and sales of developed properties to property funds and third parties and from the contributions to property funds of operating properties that were acquired with that intent prologis uses its development and leasing expertise to rehabilitate andor reposition certain of the properties that it acquires such that the subsequent contribution of the property is expected to generate a profit to prologis prologis also earns fees from customers for development activities performed on their behalf and recognizes gains and losses from sales of land parcels when prologis’ development plans no longer include these parcels   in 2003 2002 and 2001 the cdfs business segment’s operating income was 1248 million 1523 million and 1517 million respectively in 2003 39 of the operating income of this operating segment was generated in north america 39 was generated in europe and 22 was generated in japan in 2002 and 2001 36 and 43 respectively of the operating income of this operating segment was generated in north america in 2002 europe generated 60 of the operating income of this operating segment and japan generated the remaining 4 in 2001 europe generated the remaining portion of the cdfs business segment’s operating income 8   operational information about this operating segment for 2003 includes    see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations — cdfs business” and note 10 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

   prologis’ cdfs business segment operates in substantially all of prologis’ property operations segment’s markets at december 31 2003 prologis had properties under development in six markets in the united states two markets in mexico 12 markets in six countries in europe and in japan tokyo nagoya and osaka at december 31 2003 the land positions owned by prologis were located in 27 markets in the united states four markets in mexico and 19 markets in ten countries in europe at december 31 2003 prologis had begun development on all of its land holdings in japan 

 

   until recently prologis has been the only owner of distribution properties and provider of services operating on a global basis as such prologis believes it has differentiated itself from many of its competitors   there are a number of other national regional and local developers engaged in industrial distribution property development in the north american markets where prologis conducts business prologis competes with these developers for land acquisition and development opportunities the disposition market in north america is very competitive and is driven by the supply of new developments access to capital and interest rate levels a key component of prologis’ success in the cdfs business segment in north america will continue to be its ability to develop and timely lease properties that will generate profits when contributed or sold and its ability to continue to access private capital that allows for the continued acquisition of prologis’ properties by the property funds   prologis’ competition in the cdfs business segment in europe generally comes from local and regional developers in its target markets as opposed to paneuropean real estate companies as in north america the disposition market in europe is very competitive and is driven by the supply of new developments access to capital and interest rate levels with respect to its development activities in europe prologis believes that it has a competitive advantage due to the strategic locations of its land positions owned or under control in europe and due to its personnel who are experienced in the land entitlement process   prologis has identified one other north american industrial distribution development company who is in direct competition with its cdfs business segment in japan prologis believes that it has an advantage over the local development companies in japan due to its global experience in the development of industrial distribution properties and its global customer base 

 

   prologis uses the customer relationships that it has developed through its property operations segment activities and the prologis operating system in marketing its cdfs business see “— property operations — customers” and “— prologis management” in 2003 approximately 51 of the customers that leased distribution space in prologis’ cdfs business segment properties were repeat customers of prologis 9 

 

   prologis directly employs approximately 725 persons prologis’ employees work in north america approximately 460 persons in nine countries in europe approximately 240 persons and in asia primarily in japan approximately 25 persons of the total approximately 115 employees are assigned to the cdfs business segment prologis’ other employees may assist with cdfs business segment activities prologis believes that its relationships with its employees are good prologis’ employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 

 

   the demand for industrial distribution properties that are developed or acquired in the cdfs business segment is not seasonal in nature however the development process can be impeded by weather in certain markets particularly during the winter months affecting the scheduling of development activities and potentially delaying construction completions 

 

   prologis’ success in the cdfs business segment depends on its ability to develop and timely lease properties and its access to private capital that can be used by a property fund to acquire properties that have been developed or acquired in this segment prologis believes that the reconfiguration of supply chains driven by the need for distribution space users to add efficiencies within their distribution networks will continue to favorably impact the demand for distribution properties and the distributionrelated services that prologis offers in the cdfs business segment also the limited supply of stateoftheart distribution space in europe and japan could also provide opportunities within this operating segment   prologis intends to utilize the capital generated through the contributions and sales of properties the proceeds from public debt offerings that take advantage of favorable market conditions and its shortterm borrowing facilities to fund its future cdfs business activities   prologis is committed to offer to contribute its stabilized developed properties available in specific markets in europe to prologis european properties fund through september 2019 and all of its stabilized developed properties available in japan to prologis japan properties fund through june 2006 prologis believes that while the current capital commitments and borrowing capacities of these property funds will be expended prior to the expiration dates of these commitments each property fund does have sufficient capital to acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available during 2004   prologis’ commitment to offer to contribute certain of its stabilized developed properties in north america to prologis north american properties fund v expired at the end of 2003 however prologis north american properties fund v did acquire two properties from prologis in january 2004 while prologis north american properties fund v’s majority owner is a listed property trust in australia that is able to raise capital in the public market there can be no assurance that prologis north american properties fund v will have the available capital to acquire additional properties from prologis in 2004 or if capital is available that prologis north american properties fund v will want to use its capital to acquire properties from prologis further there can be no assurance that prologis will continue to offer to contribute properties to prologis north american properties fund v   there can be no assurance that if existing property funds do not continue to acquire the properties that prologis has available that prologis will be able to secure other sources of private equity capital such that it can contribute or sell these properties in a timely manner and allow prologis to continue to generate profits from its development activities in a particular reporting period   see the discussion of factors that could affect the future plans of prologis in the cdfs business segment at “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk factors” 10

environmental matters   under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at on under or in its property the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances the presence of such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow funds by using such real estate as collateral prologis has not been notified by any governmental authority of any noncompliance liability or other claim in connection with any of the properties owned directly or through investments in property funds or being acquired as of december 31 2003 and prologis is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of its properties that is likely to have a material adverse effect on prologis’ business financial condition or results of operations prologis or the predecessor owners have subjected each of its properties to an environmental assessment which may not involve invasive procedures such as soil sampling or ground water analysis by independent consultants while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling none of these environmental assessments have revealed nor is prologis aware of any environmental liability including asbestosrelated liability that prologis believes would have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition or results of operations no assurance can be given however that these assessments and investigations have revealed or will reveal all potential environmental liabilities that no prior owner or operator created any material environmental condition not known to prologis or the independent consultants or that future uses or conditions including without limitation customer actions or changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations will not result in unreimbursed costs relating to environmental liabilities see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk factors” 17 

insurance coverage   prologis and its unconsolidated investees carry comprehensive insurance coverage prologis determines the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what it deems to be the risks associated with its ownership of properties and other of its business operations in specific markets such coverage includes property liability fire flood earthquake environmental terrorism extended coverage and rental loss prologis believes that its insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties business activities and markets and prologis believes its properties and the properties of its unconsolidated investees are adequately insured however an uninsured loss could result in loss of capital investment and anticipated profits see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk factors” 


 

risk factors   prologis’ operations involve various risks that could adversely affect prologis’ financial condition results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of prologis’ common shares these risks include among others 

 

 

 

   prologis is exposed to the general economic conditions and the local regional national and international economic conditions that affect the markets in which it owns properties prologis’ operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which it has concentrations of properties prologis does not have in excess of 10 of its directly owned portfolio in any one market nor does it have in excess of 10 of its total portfolio including properties owned by the property funds in any one market however prologis does have significant holdings in atlanta chicago dallas ft worth houston los angeles paris san francisco and certain markets in the united kingdom prologis’ operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions in the markets with concentrations of properties such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space become less favorable any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction of demand for distribution space could adversely affect prologis’ results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of prologis’ common shares 

 

   real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk while prologis seeks to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of its portfolio market research and its property management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated the factors that can affect real estate values include  

 

   prologis’ investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector this concentration may expose prologis to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if prologis’ business activities included other types of real estate investments 68 

 

   prologis has developed a significant number of distribution properties since its inception and intends to continue to pursue development activities as opportunities arise such development activities generally require various government and other approvals and prologis may not receive such approvals prologis will be subject to risks associated with such development activities including but not limited to  

 

   prologis has contributed to property funds or sold to third parties a significant number of distribution properties in recent years prologis intends to continue to contribute and sell properties as opportunities arise particularly from its cdfs business segment prologis’ ability to contribute or sell properties on advantageous terms is dependent upon several factors some of which are beyond the control of prologis’ management primarily competition from other owners of distribution properties that are trying to dispose of their properties prologis’ ability to develop and timely lease properties will impact prologis’ ability to contribute or sell these properties continued access to private debt and equity capital by the property funds is necessary in order for prologis to continue its strategy of contributing properties to the property funds should prologis not have sufficient properties available that meet the investment criteria of current or future property funds or should the property funds have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then these contributions could be delayed resulting in adverse effects on prologis’ liquidity and on its ability to meet projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period failure to meet its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period could have an adverse effect on prologis’ results of operations distributable cash flow and on the value of prologis’ common shares further prologis’ inability to redeploy the proceeds from its divestitures in accordance with its investment strategy could have an adverse affect on prologis’ results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of its common shares in subsequent periods 

 

   prologis acquires distribution properties from time to time the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and the risk that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates there is and it is expected that there will continue to be significant competition for investment opportunities that meet prologis’ investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities if necessary 

 

   prologis’ results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of its common shares would be adversely affected if a significant number of prologis’ tenants are unable to meet their lease obligations to prologis in the event of default by a significant number of tenants prologis may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing its rights as landlord 69 

 

   prologis’ results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of its common shares would be adversely affected if prologis is unable to lease on economically favorable terms a significant amount of space in its distribution properties prologis had 43 million square feet of distribution space with leases that either expired on december 31 2003 or were on a monthtomonth basis at that date and prologis has 214 million square feet of distribution space out of a total of 1111 million occupied square feet of distribution space with leases that expire in 2004 in its directly owned properties the property funds had a combined 15 million square feet of distribution space with leases that either expired on december 31 2003 or were on a monthtomonth basis at that date and the property funds have a combined 54 million square feet of distribution space out of a total of 926 million occupied square feet of distribution space with leases that expire in 2004 the number of distribution properties in a market or submarket could adversely affect both prologis’ ability to release distribution space and the rental rates that can be obtained in new leases 

 

   real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may tend to limit prologis’ ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions in addition significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments like other companies qualifying as reits under the code prologis must comply with the safe harbor rules relating to the number of properties that can be disposed of in a year the tax bases and the costs of improvements made to these properties and meet other tests which enable a reit to avoid punitive taxation on the sale of assets thus prologis’ ability at any time to sell assets or contribute assets to property funds or other entities in which prologis has an ownership interest may be restricted 

 

   prologis and its unconsolidated investees currently carry comprehensive insurance coverage including property liability fire flood earthquake environmental terrorism extended coverage and rental loss as appropriate for the markets where each of their properties and their business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets prologis believes its properties and the properties of its unconsolidated investees are adequately insured however there are certain losses including losses from floods and losses from earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed to be economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of prologis’ properties prologis could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property 

 

   under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at on under or in its property the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances prologis conducts phase i environmental assessments as part of its due diligence activities prologis has not been notified nor is prologis aware of any environmental condition with respect to its real estate assets that are likely to be material to prologis’ financial condition however prologis cannot give any assurance that such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the presence of such substances on prologis’ real estate investments could adversely affect its ability to sell such investments or to borrow using such investments as collateral and may also have an adverse effect on prologis’ distributable cash flow 70 

 

 

 

   prologis as a reit is required to distribute at least 90 of its taxable income to its shareholders consequently prologis is as are all reits largely dependent on external capital to fund its development and acquisition activities prologis has been accessing private debt and equity capital through the establishment of property funds that acquire properties from prologis prologis’ ability to access private debt and equity capital through its property funds on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors including general market conditions and competition from other real estate companies further prologis generates significant profits as a result of the contributions of properties to the property funds to the extent that private capital is not available to the property funds to allow them to acquire properties from prologis these profits may not be realized or their realization may be delayed which could result in an earnings stream that is less predictable than some of prologis’ competitors and result in prologis not meeting its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period failure to meet its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period could have an adverse effect on the value of common shares   prologis is committed to offer to contribute its stabilized developed properties available in specific markets in europe to prologis european properties fund through september 2019 and all of its stabilized developed properties available in japan to prologis japan properties fund through june 2006 prologis believes that while the current capital commitments and borrowing capacities of these property funds will be expended prior to the expiration dates of these commitments each property fund does have sufficient capital to acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available during 2004   prologis’ commitment to offer to contribute certain of its stabilized developed properties in north america to prologis north american properties fund v expired at the end of 2003 however prologis north american properties fund v did acquire two properties from prologis in january 2004 while prologis north american properties fund v’s majority owner is a listed property trust in australia that is able to raise capital in the public market there can be no assurance that prologis north american properties fund v will have the available capital to acquire additional properties from prologis in 2004 or if capital is available that prologis north american properties fund v will want to use its capital to acquire properties from prologis further there can be no assurance that prologis will offer to contribute additional properties to prologis north american properties fund v   prologis’ ability to contribute or sell its development pipeline and recognize profits from its development activities will be jeopardized and prologis’ ability to meet its projected earnings levels and generate distributable cash flow would be adversely affected should the existing equity commitments not be available due to investor default or otherwise such that these property funds can acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available for contribution this impact would occur in the shortterm and would continue until prologis is able to sell the properties to third parties or until prologis could secure another source of private equity capital to form a new property fund 

 

   prologis currently has a policy of incurring debt only if upon such incurrence prologis’ debttobook capitalization ratio as adjusted would not exceed 50 the board could alter or eliminate this policy without shareholder approval and would do so if for example it were necessary in order for prologis to continue with its investment strategy or to continue to meet the reit requirements of the code if this policy were changed prologis could become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect its distributable cash flow 

 

   prologis is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that prologis’ cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that prologis will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as 71 favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness 

  prologis utilizes the shortterm borrowing capabilities over 153 billion as of december 31 2003 provided by six credit agreements that provide revolving lines of credit facilities to prologis in addition to operating cash flow and proceeds from dispositions to fund its development acquisition and distribution requirements prologis’ six revolving lines of credits expire through 2007 1037 million of borrowing capacity expires during 2004 1000 million of borrowing capacity expires during 2005 5552 million of borrowing capacity expires during 2006 7741 million of borrowing capacity expires during 2007 these expiration dates consider extension periods that are at prologis’ option prologis’ ability to refinance these credit agreements in a timely manner and at favorable terms is dependent on several factors including but not limited to general economic conditions prologis’ credit ratings and interest rate levels prologis’ shortterm credit agreements bear interest at variable rates increases in interest rates would increase prologis’ interest expense under these agreements if prologis is unable to refinance its indebtedness at maturity or meet its payment obligations the amount of prologis’ distributable cash flow would be adversely affected 

 

   the terms of prologis’ various credit agreements and other indebtedness require prologis to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit prologis’ flexibility in its operations and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if prologis has satisfied its payment obligations if prologis is unable to refinance its indebtedness at maturity or meet its payment obligations the amount of prologis’ distributable cash flow would be adversely affected 

 

 

 

   prologis elected to be taxed as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year ended december 31 1993 to maintain reit status prologis must meet a number of highly technical requirements on a continuing basis those requirements seek to ensure among other things that the gross income and investments of a reit are largely real estate related that a reit distributes substantially all its ordinary taxable income to shareholders on a current basis and that the reit’s equity ownership is not overly concentrated due to the complex nature of these rules the available guidance concerning interpretation of the rules the importance of ongoing factual determinations and the possibility of adverse changes in the law administrative interpretations of the law and changes in prologis’ business no assurance can be given that prologis will qualify as a reit for any particular year   if prologis fails to qualify as a reit it will be taxed as a regular corporation and distributions to shareholders will not be deductible in computing prologis’ taxable income the resulting corporate income tax liabilities could materially reduce the distributable cash flow to prologis’ shareholders and funds available for reinvestment moreover prologis might not be able to elect to be treated as a reit for the four taxable years after the year during which prologis ceased to qualify as a reit in addition if prologis later requalified as a reit it might be required to pay a full corporatelevel tax on any unrealized gains in its assets as of the date of requalification and to make distributions to shareholders equal to any earnings accumulated during the period of nonreit status in the absence of reit status distributions to shareholders would no longer be required 

 

   to maintain its qualification as a reit under the code prologis must annually distribute to its shareholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding the dividends paid deduction and its net capital gains this requirement limits prologis’ ability to accumulate capital prologis may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements difficulties in meeting the distribution requirements might arise due to competing demands for prologis’ funds or to timing differences 72 between tax reporting and cash receipts and disbursements because income may have to be reported before cash is received because expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed or because deductions may be disallowed or limited or the internal revenue service may make a determination that adjusts reported income in those situations prologis might be required to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements and interest and penalties could apply if prologis fails to make a required distribution it would cease to be taxed as a reit 

 

   prologis contributes properties to property funds and sells properties to third parties some of these contributions and sales are made from prologis’ taxable subsidiaries under the code if a disposition is deemed to be a prohibited transaction a 100 penalty tax on the resulting gain could be assessed the determination that a transaction constitutes a prohibited transaction is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction the internal revenue service could contend that certain contributions or sales of properties by prologis are prohibited transactions while prologis’ management does not believe that the internal revenue service would prevail in such a dispute if the internal revenue service successfully argued the matter the 100 penalty tax could be assessed against the gains from these transactions additionally any gain from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect prologis’ ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 

 

 

 

   prologis’ executive officers and other senior offices have a significant role in prologis’ success the ability of prologis to retain its management group or to attract suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave prologis is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market the loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their availability could adversely effect prologis’ financial condition and cash flow further such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets 

 

   the annual distribution rate on common shares as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of such common shares an increase in market interest rates may lead investors to demand a higher annual distribution rate that prologis has set which could adversely affect the value of prologis’ common shares 

 

   prologis has pursued and intends to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets and often invests in countries where the us dollar is not the national currency as a result prologis is subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar for example a significant depreciation in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where prologis has a significant investment may materially adversely affect prologis’ results of operations and the value of its common shares prologis attempts to mitigate any such effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and by entering into derivative contracts although there can be no assurance that such attempts will be successful 

 

   there are many laws and governmental regulations that are applicable to prologis its unconsolidated investees and their properties changes in these laws and governmental regulations or their interpretation by agencies or the courts could occur further economic and political factors including civil unrest governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders in the united states but primarily in the foreign countries in which prologis has invested can have a major impact on a global company such as prologis 73 





 item 2 properties industrial distribution properties   prologis has directly invested in real estate assets that are primarily generic industrial distribution properties due to the costs associated with retrofitting service center space for new customers prologis has acquired properties containing service center space on a very limited basis generally service center space has been acquired as part of portfolio acquisitions in which the majority of the properties being acquired were generic industrial distribution properties in japan prologis’ distribution properties will generally be multilevel centers which is common in japan due to the high cost and limited availability of land prologis’ properties are typically used for storage packaging assembly distribution and light manufacturing of consumer and industrial products based on the square footage of operating properties directly owned by prologis at december 31 2003 87 of prologis’ properties are used for bulk distribution with the remaining properties used for light manufacturing and assembly 11 and for other purposes primarily service centers 2   all operating properties are part of the property operations segment prologis has commitments with certain property funds that require prologis to offer to contribute certain of its stabilized developed properties to those property funds subject to certain conditions upon completion all properties under development are part of the cdfs business segment regardless of prologis’ intent with respect to a property ie direct longterm investment or expectation of future contribution or sale all properties that are classified as operating properties are included in the property operations segment while they are directly owned by prologis 

geographic distribution   prologis has direct ownership of 1279 distribution properties operating and under development in north america europe and japan at december 31 2003 in north america properties that are owned directly by prologis are located in 38 markets including three cities that are not target markets in 23 states and the district of columbia in the united states and in four markets in mexico in europe the properties that are owned directly by prologis are located in 19 markets in eight countries in japan the properties that are owned directly by prologis are currently reflected in one market that includes tokyo osaka and nagoya prologis defines its markets based on the concentration of properties in a specific area a market as defined by prologis can be a metropolitan area a city a subsection of a metropolitan area a subsection of a city or a region of a state or country accordingly the actual location of each market may not be easily identifiable by the name given to the market by prologis such markets are identified below along with the major 18 metropolitan areas or cities located in that market to assist in understanding the information presented in the tables that follow in item 2 

   the table below illustrates the geographic distribution of prologis’ portfolio of directly owned operating properties and properties under development the table excludes land held for future development the table includes properties owned by prologis and its consolidated subsidiaries and partnerships which may not be 100 owned by prologis see “— real estate partnerships” the table does not include properties that are owned by the property funds or prologis’ other unconsolidated investees which are discussed under “— unconsolidated investees”  19  20   21  

properties   the information in the following tables is as of december 31 2003 for the properties and land directly owned by prologis and its consolidated subsidiaries and partnerships which may not be 100 owned by prologis see “— real estate partnerships” no individual property or group of properties operated as a single business unit amounted to 10 or more of prologis’ consolidated total assets at december 31 2003 or generated income equal to 10 or more of prologis’ consolidated gross revenues or total income for the year ended december 31 2003 the table does not include properties that are owned by property funds or by prologis’ other unconsolidated investees which are discussed under “— unconsolidated investees”  22  23   24   25  26    27  

real estate partnerships   at december 31 2003 prologis held a majority ownership interest in and controlled five real estate partnerships collectively the “partnerships” for financial reporting purposes the assets liabilities results of operations and cash flows of each of the partnerships are included in prologis’ consolidated financial statements and in the preceding real estate tables the interests of the limited partners are reflected as minority interest in prologis’ consolidated balance sheet   generally pursuant to partnership agreements prologis or a wholly owned subsidiary of prologis is the sole controlling general partner of each of the partnerships with all management powers over the business and affairs of the partnership the limited partners of each partnership generally do not have the authority to transact business for or participate in the management decisions of the partnerships the general partner in each of the partnerships may not without the written consent of all of the limited partners i take any action that would prevent the partnership from conducting its business ii possess the property of the partnership iii admit an additional partner or iv subject a limited partner to the liability of a general partner in each partnership prologis or a wholly owned subsidiary may not voluntarily withdraw from the partnership or transfer or assign its interests in the partnership without the consent of all of the limited partners the limited partners may freely transfer their partnership units to their affiliates provided that the transfer does not cause a termination of the partnership under the code and does not cause prologis to cease to comply with the reit requirements of the code the limited partners in each of the partnerships are entitled to redeem their partnership units for common shares additionally the limited partners are entitled to receive preferential cumulative quarterly distributions per outstanding unit equal to the quarterly distributions paid on common shares   see note 6 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 28   the partnerships are as follows at december 31 2003    

unconsolidated investees   at december 31 2003 prologis’ investments in and advances to unconsolidated investees entities that prologis present under the equity method rather than on a consolidated basis totaled 6773 million prologis’ investments in and advances to property funds discussed below under “— property operations” totaled 5482 million at december 31 2003 prologis’ investments in and advances to its entities operating in the cdfs business segment totaled 128 million at december 31 2003 prologis’ investment in and advances to a temperaturecontrolled distribution company was 1138 million at december 31 2003 prologis’ investments in and advances to other companies that do not own and operate real estate totaled 29 25 million at december 31 2003 prologis’ unconsolidated investees are discussed in note 4 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 see also “item 1 business — prologis’ operating segments” 

  prologis’ investments in unconsolidated investees other than the property funds were structured to allow prologis to comply with the reit requirements of the code certain of these investees produce income that is not reit qualifying income ie not rental income or mortgage interest income to maintain its qualification as a reit prologis can collectively invest in these companies and other taxable reit subsidiaries in amounts up to 20 of the fair market value of prologis’ total assets   with respect to the property funds maintaining an ownership interest of 50 or less is integral to prologis’ business strategy this business strategy allows prologis to i realize for financial reporting purposes a portion of the profits from its cdfs business activities upon contribution of a property to a property fund ii earn fees from the property funds iii raise private capital to fund its future cdfs business activities iv maintain an ownership interest in its developed properties and v maintain relationships with its customers see “item 1 business — prologis — business strategy and global presence” 

 

   at december 31 2003 prologis had ownership interests ranging from 14 to 50 in eight property funds that are presented under the equity method the property funds primarily own operating properties and prologis’ investments in the property funds are included in its property operations segment the information provided in the table below is for the total entity in which prologis has an ownership interest not prologis’ proportionate share of the entity prologis acts as manager of each property fund see “item 1 business — prologis’ operating segments — property operations” and note 4 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8  30  31  32   

 

   in the united kingdom a wholly owned subsidiary of prologis has active investments in three joint ventures the “cdfs joint ventures” that primarily own and develop distribution properties and own land for the future development of distribution properties prologis’ ownership in each of the cdfs joint ventures is 50 collectively the cdfs joint ventures owned 57 acres of land with the capacity for the development of approximately 03 million square feet of distribution properties at december 31 2003 additionally at december 31 2003 the cdfs joint ventures collectively controlled 398 acres of land through contracts options or letters of intent with the capacity for the development of approximately 76 million square feet of distribution properties see “item 1 business — prologis’ operating segments — cdfs business” 33

 market information and holders   prologis’ common shares are listed on the nyse under the symbol “pld” the following table sets forth the high and low sale prices of the common shares as reported in the nyse composite tape and distributions per common share for the periods indicated     on march 5 2004 prologis had approximately 181071178 common shares outstanding which were held of record by approximately 9600 shareholders distributions and dividends   in order to comply with the reit requirements of the code prologis is required to make common share distributions other than capital gain distributions to its shareholders in amounts at least equal to i the sum of a 90 of its “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and its net capital gains and b 90 of the net income after tax if any from foreclosure property minus ii the sum of certain items of noncash income prologis’ common share distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of its cash flow that ensures that prologis will meet the distribution requirements of the code and that allows prologis to maximize the cash retained to meet other cash needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities   prologis announces the following year’s projected annual common share distribution level after the board performs its annual budget review and approves a common share distribution level generally in december of each year in december 2003 the board announced a projected increase in the annual distribution level for 2004 from 144 to 146 per common share the payment of common share distributions is subject to the discretion of the board is dependent on prologis’ financial condition and operating results and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year on january 29 2004 the board declared a distribution of 0365 per common share for the first quarter of 2004 this distribution was paid on february 27 2004 to holders of common shares on february 13 2004   common share distributions to shareholders are characterized for federal income tax purposes as ordinary income capital gains nontaxable return of capital or a combination of the three common share 35 distributions that exceed prologis’ current and accumulated earnings and profits calculated for tax purposes constitute a return of capital rather than a dividend and generally reduce the shareholders’ basis in the common shares to the extent that a distribution exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the shareholder’s basis in the common shares it will generally be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of that shareholder’s common shares at the beginning of each year prologis notifies its shareholders of the taxability of the common share distributions paid during the preceding year the following table summarizes the taxability of prologis’ distributions on common shares for the periods indicated in us dollars taxability for 2003 is estimated 

   in addition to common shares prologis has issued cumulative redeemable preferred shares of beneficial interest “preferred shares” at december 31 2003 prologis had four series of preferred shares outstanding “series c preferred shares” “series d preferred shares” “series f preferred shares” and “series g preferred shares” previously prologis had two other series of preferred shares “series a preferred shares” and “series e preferred shares” and one series of cumulative convertible redeemable preferred shares of beneficial interest “series b convertible preferred shares” outstanding all of which have been redeemed holders of each series of preferred shares outstanding have subject to certain conditions limited voting rights and are entitled to receive cumulative preferential dividends based upon each series’ respective liquidation preference such dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of march june september and december dividends on preferred shares are payable when and if they have been declared by the board out of funds legally available for payment of dividends after the respective redemption dates each series of preferred shares can be redeemed at prologis’ option the cash redemption price other than the portion consisting of accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to series c preferred shares and series d preferred shares is payable solely out of the cumulative sales proceeds of other capital shares of prologis which may include shares of other series of preferred shares with respect to the payment of dividends each series of preferred shares ranks on parity with prologis’ other series of preferred shares annual per share dividends paid on each series of preferred shares were as follows for the periods indicated in us dollars   36    pursuant to the terms of its preferred shares prologis is restricted from declaring or paying any distribution with respect to its common shares unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred shares have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the thencurrent dividend period with respect to the preferred shares   prologis’ tax return for the year ended december 31 2003 has not been filed the taxability information presented for prologis’ distributions and dividends paid in 2003 is based upon the best available data prologis’ tax returns for previous tax years have not been examined by the internal revenue service consequently the taxability of distributions and dividends is subject to change   prologis’ earnings and profits are first allocated to the preferred shares which increases the portion of the common share distribution that is characterized as return of capital the portion of the common share distribution that is characterized as return of capital represents the excess of distributions over the earnings and profits and primarily results because noncash charges such as depreciation are not considered in determining distribution levels see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans   for information regarding securities authorized for issuance under prologis’ equity compensation plans see note 12 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 the other information required by this item 5 is incorporated herein by reference to the description under the caption “equity compensation plan information” in prologis’ definitive proxy statement for its 2004 annual meeting of shareholders “2004 proxy statement” other shareholder matters

item 6 selected financial data   the following table sets forth selected financial data relating to the historical financial condition and results of operations of prologis for 2003 and the four preceding years certain amounts for the years prior to 2003 presented in the table below have been reclassified to conform to the 2003 financial statement presentation the financial data in the tables is qualified in its entirety by and should be read in conjunction with “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and prologis’ consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8   prologis begins presenting its investments in previously unconsolidated investees on a consolidated basis when such presentation change is required under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” based on changes in prologis’ ownership interest previously reported financial information is not required to be restated under gaap when the reporting method is changed to consolidation from the equity method under these circumstances prologis’ consolidated shareholders’ equity and its consolidated net earnings are the same under the two reporting methods see note 2 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 38   the amounts in the table below are in thousands of us dollars except for per share amounts  39  40     41      42   

 

   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with prologis’ consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this report   some statements contained in this discussion are not historical facts but are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 because these forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which prologis operates management’s beliefs and assumptions made by management they involve uncertainties that could significantly impact prologis’ financial results words such as “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “believes” “seeks” “estimates” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements include discussions of strategy plans or intentions of management these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict the discussions concerning prologis’ expectations with respect to economic conditions in the geographic areas where it has operations and its ability to raise private capital and generate income in the cdfs business segment including the discussions with respect to prologis’ expectations as to the availability of capital in its existing property funds such that these property funds will be able to acquire prologis’ stabilized developed properties that are expected to be available for contribution in the future contain forwardlooking statements therefore actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forwardlooking statements factors that may affect outcomes and results include i changes in general economic conditions in prologis’ markets that could adversely affect demand for prologis’ properties and the creditworthiness of prologis’ customers ii changes in financial markets interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could adversely affect prologis’ cost of capital its ability to meet its financial needs and obligations and its results of operations iii increased or unanticipated competition for distribution properties in prologis’ markets iv the availability of private capital to prologis v geopolitical concerns and uncertainties and vi those additional factors discussed under “— risk factors” 43 

overview   a summary of the discussions that follow in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” is presented below 

 

  

 

  

critical accounting policies   a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity’s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management generally the judgment requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain of the accounting 44 policies discussed in note 2 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 those presented below have been identified by prologis as critical accounting policies 

 

   prologis’ consolidated financial statements include the accounts of prologis its wholly owned subsidiaries and its majorityowned and controlled subsidiaries and partnerships all entities in which prologis owns a majority voting interest are consolidated investments in entities in which prologis does not own a majority voting interest but over which prologis does have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method investments in entities in which prologis does not own a majority voting interest and over which prologis does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as appropriate management’s judgments with respect to its level of influence or control of each entity involves consideration of various factors including the form of prologis’ ownership interest its representation on the entity’s board of directors the size of its investment including loans and prologis’ ability to participate in policy making decisions management’s ability to correctly assess its influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in prologis’ consolidated financial statements and consequently its financial position and specific items in its results of operations that are used by its shareholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders to evaluate prologis   in january 2003 interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” was issued interpretation no 46 was revised in december 2003 the revised interpretation no 46 “fin 46r” is applicable to prologis for the interim period that ends after march 15 2004 fin 46r clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” and requires that prologis present the variable interest entities in which it has a majority variable interest on a consolidated basis in its financial statements prologis is continuing to assess the provisions of fin 46r and the impact to prologis of its adoption at this time prologis expects that it will consolidate its investments in tcl holding sa formerly frigoscandia holding sa “tcl holding” and csi frigo llc a company that holds the voting ownership interest in tcl holding as of january 1 2004 through december 31 2003 prologis has presented its investments in tcl holding and csi frigo llc under the equity method prologis’ combined effective ownership in these entities was 9975 at december 31 2003 prologis expects that it will continue to present its investments in all of its other unconsolidated investees under the equity method after fin 46r is adopted management’s ability to correctly assess its investments under the new rules with respect to variable interest entities will affect the presentation of these investments in prologis’ consolidated financial statements and consequently its financial position and specific items in its results of operations that are used by its shareholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders to evaluate prologis 

 

   prologis and its unconsolidated investees assess the carrying values of their respective longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable and with respect to goodwill at least annually applying a fairvaluebased test the determination of the fair values of longlived assets including goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on management’s analysis and estimates of the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each longlived asset management’s ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows impacts the determination of fair value   if there is a decline in the fair value of a longlived asset combined with a history of the asset generating operating losses prologis or its unconsolidated investees will be required to determine whether the operating losses associated with the asset will continue management’s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is primarily based on estimates of future operating results the resulting cash flows and prologis’ intent to either hold or dispose of the longlived asset if an investment is considered impaired a writedown is recognized based on these analyses 45 

 

   prologis recognizes gains and losses from the contributions and sales of real estate assets generally at the time the title is transferred and prologis has no future involvement as a direct owner of the real estate asset contributed or sold in certain transactions an entity in which prologis has an ownership interest will acquire a real estate asset from prologis management makes judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that prologis can recognize given its continuing ownership interest and its level of future involvement with the investee that acquires the assets management’s ability to accurately assess the provisions of each transaction under the accounting guidelines for profit recognition could impact prologis’ financial position and specific items in its results of operations that are used by shareholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders to evaluate prologis 

 

   prologis estimates the depreciable portion of its real estate assets and their related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense management’s ability to accurately estimate the depreciable portions of its real estate assets and their useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying values of the underlying assets any change to the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized by prologis 

results of operations   prologis’ net earnings attributable to common shares were 2124 million in 2003 2162 million in 2002 and 860 million in 2001 basic and diluted net earnings attributable to common shares were 118 and 116 per share respectively in 2003 122 and 120 per share respectively in 2002 and 050 and 049 per share respectively in 2001 

 

   in addition to its directly owned operating properties prologis includes its investments in the property funds that are presented under the equity method in its property operations segment see note 4 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 prologis owned operating properties directly or had ownership interests in operating properties through its investments in the property funds as follows as of the dates indicated square feet in thousands     see “item 2 properties — properties” and “item 2 properties — unconsolidated investees”   the operating income of prologis’ property operations segment consists of i rental income and rental expenses from the operating properties that are directly owned by prologis ii income recognized by prologis under the equity method from its investments in the property funds iii fees and other income earned by prologis for services performed on behalf of the property funds primarily property management and asset management services and iv interest earned on advances to the property funds if any the net earnings or losses generated by operating properties that were developed or acquired in the cdfs business segment are included in the property operations segment during the interim period that these properties are included in the property operations segment generally from the date of completion or acquisition through the date the properties are contributed or sold see “item 1 “business — prologis’ operating segments — 46 property operations” “item 1 business — prologis’ operating segments — cdfs business” and note 10 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 

  the amounts recognized under the equity method represent prologis’ proportionate share of the net earnings or loss of each property fund based on its ownership interest in the property fund the net earnings or losses of the property funds includes the following income and expense items in addition to rental income and rental expenses i interest income and interest expense ii depreciation and amortization expenses iii general and administrative expenses iv income taxes and v foreign currency exchange gains and losses with respect to prologis european properties fund see notes 4 and 10 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 prologis’ operating income from the property operations segment was as follows for the periods indicated in thousands of us dollars   47      48     the stabilized operating properties owned by prologis and the property funds were 902 leased at december 31 2003 912 leased at december 31 2002 and 931 leased at december 31 2001 prologis defines its stabilized properties as those properties where the capital improvements repositioning efforts new management and new marketing programs for acquisitions or the marketing programs in the case of newly developed properties have been completed and in effect for a sufficient period of time generally 12 months a property enters the stabilized pool at the earlier of 12 months or when it is substantially leased which is defined by prologis generally as 93   prologis believes that the reduction in its stabilized occupancy levels experienced in 2003 was primarily the result of weak economic conditions in the united states and certain western european countries that resulted in a slowing of customer leasing decisions and a slowing in the absorption of new distribution properties in many of prologis’ markets additionally prologis believes that geopolitical concerns and uncertainties primarily in europe in the early part of 2003 also contributed to the slower leasing activity prologis has not observed similar trends in japan prologis does not expect economic conditions to change significantly in 2004 while there were some positive trends in occupancy levels in certain markets in late 2003 prologis believes that occupancies will not increase significantly but that further declines in occupancies if any will not be significant prologis continues to believe that shifts in distribution patterns of its customers in europe and japan and their needs to reduce their distribution costs have been and will continue to be key drivers of leasing decisions in many of its european markets and in japan prologis believes that the diversification of its global operating platform and the prologis operating system have somewhat mitigated the effects of market occupancy decreases   rental rates in 2003 for both new and renewed leases for previously leased space 428 million square feet for all properties including those owned by the property funds decreased by 48 as compared to rental rate growth of 20 in 2002 and 146 in 2001 on similar transactions prologis believes that the negative rental rate growth experienced in 2003 is the result of decreased customer demand that negatively impacts the rental rates that can be charged in a particular market   prologis’ same store portfolio of operating properties properties owned by prologis and the property funds that were in operation throughout all of 2003 and 2002 aggregated 1793 million square feet prologis views the operating results of the same store portfolio as a key component in evaluating the performance of its properties its management personnel and its individual markets because this population is consistent from period to period thereby eliminating the effects on performance measures of changes in the composition of the portfolio net operating income defined for the same store analysis as rental income excluding termination and renegotiation fees less rental expenses generated by the same store portfolio increased by 009 in 2003 from 2002 in 2002 the net operating income of the same store portfolio applicable to that period decreased by 090 from 2001 the percentage change presented is the weighted average of the measure computed separately for prologis and each of the property funds with the weighting based on each entity’s proportionate share of the combined component on which the change is computed in order to derive an appropriate measure of periodtoperiod operating performance the percentage change computation removes the effects of 49 foreign currency exchange rate movements by computing each property’s components in that property’s functional currency 

  rental income computed under gaap applicable to the properties included in the same store portfolio is adjusted to remove the net termination and renegotiation fees recognized in each period net termination and renegotiation fees excluded from rental income were 16 million for directly owned properties and 12 million for properties owned by the property funds for 2003 125 million for directly owned properties and 63 million for properties owned by the property funds for 2002 and 17 million for directly owned properties and 003 million for properties owned by the property funds for 2001 net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate their lease offset by that customer’s rent leveling asset that has been previously recognized under gaap if any removing the net termination fees from the same store calculation of rental income allows prologis’ management to evaluate the growth or decline in each property’s rental income without regard to items that are not indicative of the property’s recurring operating performance customer terminations are negotiated under specific circumstances and are not subject to specific provisions or rights allowed under the lease agreements   in computing the percentage change in rental expenses the rental expenses applicable to the properties in the same store portfolio include property management expenses for prologis’ directly owned properties these expenses are based on the property management fee that is provided for in the individual agreements under which prologis’ wholly owned management company provides property management services to each property generally the fee is based on a percentage of revenues on consolidation the management fee income earned by the management company and the management fee expense recognized by the properties are eliminated and the direct costs of providing management services are recognized as part of prologis’ net rental expenses reported under gaap 

 

   operating income from prologis’ cdfs business segment consists primarily of i the gains and losses from the contributions and sales of developed properties and from the contributions of properties that were acquired with the intent to contribute the properties to a property fund including properties that have been rehabilitated andor repositioned ii gains and losses from the dispositions of land parcels iii development management fees earned by prologis for services provided to third parties and iv income recognized under the equity method from prologis’ investments in unconsolidated investees through june 30 2002 under the equity method prologis recognized its proportionate shares of the earnings of prologis uk holdings sa formerly kingspark holding sa collectively with its subsidiaries “kingspark sa” a luxembourg company that performs cdfs business activities in the united kingdom and kingspark llc a holding company that held the voting ownership interests of kingspark sa through june 30 2002 prologis began consolidating its investments in kingspark sa and kingspark llc on july 1 2002 see notes 2 and 4 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 prologis’ proportionate shares of the net earnings or losses recognized from its ownership interests in kingspark sa and kingspark llc includes in addition to net operating income i interest income and interest expense net of capitalized amounts ii general and administrative expenses net of capitalized amounts iii income taxes and iv foreign currency exchange gains and losses   income from the cdfs business segment is dependent on prologis’ ability to develop and timely lease properties or to acquire properties that can be contributed to property funds or sold to third parties generating profits to prologis and prologis’ success in raising private capital to acquire its properties through the formation of property funds or other sources in 2003 prologis’ operating income in this segment decreased from 2002 by 275 million this decrease was due to longer leaseup periods for prologis’ cdfs business segment properties as prologis observed a slowing of customers’ decisionmaking processes with respect to changes in their distribution networks prologis attributes the decreased leasing activity experienced in 2003 to economic weaknesses in many of its markets coupled with geopolitical concerns and uncertainties primarily in europe during the early part of 2003 there can be no assurance that prologis will be able to maintain or increase the current level of operating income in this operating segment prologis cannot predict the effect that any economic and other uncertainties will continue to have on its ability to lease its properties 50 or the length of time that such uncertainties will continue if prologis is unable to timely lease its completed developments it will be unable to contribute these properties to property funds or otherwise dispose of the properties and would be unable to recognize profits from its development activities in the anticipated reporting period see “item 1 prologis — prologis’ operating segments — cdfs business — future plans” “— risk factors — general real estate risks — risks associated with the contribution and sale of properties” and “— risk factors — financing and capital risks — access to capital” 

  prologis’ operating income from the cdfs business segment decreased in 2003 from 2002 and 2001 levels the cdfs business segment’s operating income includes the following components for the periods indicated in thousands of us dollars    had prologis presented its investments in kingspark sa and kingspark llc on a consolidated basis for all of 2002 and 2001 prologis’ cdfs business segment’s operating income would have been as follows in thousands of us dollars     51        since 1999 prologis’ focus in the cdfs business segment reflects the economic and market conditions in the areas in which it owns properties accordingly there has been a shift of prologis’ cdfs business activity since 2000 in favor of japan prologis’ cdfs business segment assets were located in north america 35 and europe 65 at december 31 2000 at december 31 2003 prologis’ cdfs business segment 52 assets were located in north america 22 europe 57 and japan 21 the operating income of the cdfs business segment was earned as follows for 2003 2002 and 2001 

   see note 10 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8   prologis will continue to monitor leasing activity and general economic conditions in the united states as it pertains to its cdfs business segment operations with the expectation that such an economic recovery could provide increased cdfs business opportunities to prologis as companies continue optimizing their supply chains prologis believes that the continued demand for stateoftheart distribution properties in europe could result in the acceleration of leasing decisions that could provide opportunities for prologis in the cdfs business segment however prologis will continue to monitor the impacts of economic and other uncertainties that negatively impacted leasing in europe during 2003 prologis believes its development activities will not be significantly affected by land entitlement constraints that currently exist in europe because it has almost 1900 acres of land owned or controlled in europe at december 31 2003 and its personnel are experienced in the land entitlement process as in europe prologis believes that demand for stateoftheart distribution properties in japan will continue to provide opportunities for prologis in the cdfs business segment prologis has not observed similar trends in japan with respect to economic and other uncertainties in japan the cdfs business opportunities available to prologis will be limited if prologis is unable to acquire adequate land parcels for development

liquidity and capital resources 

 

   prologis considers its liquidity and its ability to generate cash from its operating activities the contributions and sales of properties and other financing sources to be adequate and expects it to continue to be adequate to meet its anticipated future development acquisition operating and debt service needs as well as its shareholder distribution requirements   prologis expects that its primary cash needs will consist of the following in 2004 and future years  58   while prologis has a common share repurchase program under which it may repurchase an additional 841 million of common shares at march 5 2004 prologis does not currently expect that it will require significant cash for this program in 2004   prologis expects to fund its cash needs in 2004 and future years with cash from the following sources    for its shortterm borrowing needs revolving lines of credit have provided and are expected to continue to provide prologis with the liquidity and financial flexibility that allows it to efficiently respond to market opportunities and execute its business strategy regular repayments of lines of credit borrowings primarily with the proceeds from property contributions and sales and the proceeds from the issuance of longerterm debt that are expected to occur periodically during periods of favorable market conditions allow prologis to maintain adequate liquidity   at march 5 2004 prologis had 152 billion of total borrowing capacities under its revolving lines of credit prologis’ total outstanding borrowings were 7698 million at march 5 2004 resulting in additional shortterm borrowing capacity available to prologis of approximately 7282 million after reducing the total borrowing capacities available by 237 million of letters of credit outstanding with certain of the lending banks see “— borrowing capacity and debt maturities”   at march 5 2004 prologis had 7500 million of shelfregistered securities that can be issued in the form of debt securities preferred shares common shares rights to purchase common shares and preferred share purchase rights on an asneeded basis subject to prologis’ ability to affect an offering on satisfactory terms prologis continues to evaluate the global public debt markets with the objective of reducing its shortterm borrowings in favor of longerterm fixedrate debt when it is deemed appropriate   prologis is committed to offer to contribute its stabilized developed properties available in specific markets in europe to prologis european properties fund through september 2019 and all of its stabilized developed properties available in japan to prologis japan properties fund through june 2006 prologis believes that while the current capital commitments and borrowing capacities of these property funds will be expended prior to the expiration dates of these commitments each property fund does have sufficient capital to acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available during 2004   prologis’ commitment to offer to contribute certain of its stabilized developed properties in north america to prologis north american properties fund v expired at the end of 2003 however prologis north american properties fund v did acquire two properties from prologis in january 2004 while prologis north american properties fund v’s majority owner is a listed property trust in australia that is able to raise capital in the public market there can be no assurance that prologis north american properties fund v will have the available capital to acquire additional properties from prologis in 2004 or if capital is available that prologis north american properties fund v will want to use its capital to acquire properties from prologis further there can be no assurance that prologis will continue to offer to contribute properties to prologis north american properties fund v   should the property funds not have sufficient capital to acquire the properties that prologis has available prologis is allowed to pursue other third party disposition opportunities however there can be no assurance 59 that prologis can readily dispose of its cdfs business properties to third parties or that prologis could raise private capital through the formation of another property fund that would acquire the properties also prologis could experience delays in completing dispositions to third parties or to new property funds such delays could result in the recognition of the expected development profits in a reporting period later than originally anticipated see the discussion of risks factors involved with disposition of properties and the raising of capital at “— risk factors”

   prologis’ common share distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of its cash flow that ensures that prologis will meet the distribution requirements of the code and that allows prologis to maximize the cash retained to meet other cash needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities because depreciation is a noncash expense cash flow typically will be greater than operating income and net earnings   cash distributions per common share paid in 2003 2002 and 2001 were 144 142 and 138 respectively the board set a projected annual distribution rate for 2004 of 146 per common share prologis paid a distribution for the first quarter of 2004 of 0365 per common share on february 27 2004 to holders of common shares at february 13 2004 the payment of common share distributions is subject to the discretion of the board is dependent on prologis’ financial condition and operating results and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year prologis has increased its common share distribution level every year since its common shares became publicly traded in 1994   at december 31 2003 prologis had four series of preferred shares outstanding the annual dividend rates on prologis’ preferred shares are 427 per series c preferred share 198 per series d preferred share 169 per series f preferred share and 169 per series g preferred share the series d preferred shares were redeemed in january 2004   pursuant to the terms of its preferred shares prologis is restricted from declaring or paying any distribution with respect to its common shares unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred shares have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the then current dividend period with respect to the preferred shares 

 

   at december 31 2003 prologis had letters of intent or contingent contracts subject to prologis’ final due diligence for the acquisition of properties aggregating 50 million square feet at an estimated total acquisition cost of 2203 million through february 29 2004 prologis completed the acquisitions of seven of these properties aggregating 09 million square feet at a total acquisition cost of 315 million the remaining transactions are subject to a number of conditions and prologis cannot predict with certainty that they will be consummated   under a common share repurchase program prologis may repurchase up to 2150 million of common shares the common shares that have been repurchased to date were purchased in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions depending on market prices and other conditions future repurchases if any are expected to be through similar transactions through march 5 2004 prologis has repurchased 5571000 common shares under this program at a total cost of 1309 million an additional 841 million of common shares may be repurchased under the program as march 5 2004 prologis does not currently expect that it will make significant common share repurchases in 2004   prologis from time to time enters into special limited contribution agreements “slca” in connection with certain of its contributions of properties to certain of its property funds under the slcas prologis is obligated to make an additional capital contribution to the respective property fund under certain circumstances the occurrence of which prologis believes to be remote specifically prologis would be required to make an additional capital contribution if the property fund’s thirdparty lender whose loans to the property fund are generally secured by the property fund’s assets and are nonrecourse does not receive a specified minimum level of debt repayment however the proceeds received by the thirdparty lender from the exhaustion of all of the assets of the property fund combined with the debt repayments received directly from the property fund will reduce prologis’ obligations under the slca on a dollarfordollar basis prologis’ potential obligations under the respective slcas as a percentage of the assets in the property funds range from 2 to 28 accordingly the value of the assets of the respective property funds would have to decline by between 98 and 72 before prologis would be required to make an additional capital contribution prologis believes that the likelihood of declines in the values of the assets that support the thirdparty loans of the magnitude necessary to require an additional capital contribution is remote especially in 64 light of the geographically diversified portfolios of properties owned by the property funds accordingly these potential obligations have not been recognized as a liability by prologis at december 31 2003 and prologis has assessed a nominal value to the guarantee undertaken through the slcas the potential obligations under the slcas aggregate 3578 million at december 31 2003 and the combined book value of the assets in the property funds before depreciation that are subject to the provisions of the slcas was approximately 52 billion at december 31 2003 

 

   prologis uses derivative financial instruments as hedges to manage welldefined risk associated with interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on existing or anticipated obligations and transactions prologis does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes   the primary risks associated with derivative instruments are market risk and credit risk market risk is defined as the potential for loss in the value of the derivative due to adverse changes in market prices interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates the use of derivative financial instruments allows prologis to manage the risks of increases in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the effects these fluctuations would have on prologis’ income and cash flows   credit risk is the risk that one of the parties to a derivative contract fails to perform or meet their financial obligation under the contract prologis does not obtain collateral to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of counterparties primarily global commercial banks prologis does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties to its derivative contracts however should a counterparty fail to perform prologis would incur a financial loss to the extent of the positive fair market value of the derivative contracts if any   at december 31 2003 prologis had foreign currency put option contracts outstanding in the notional amount of 284 million euro 77 million pound sterling and 8744 million yen the aggregate currency equivalent of approximately 579 million at december 31 2003 related to its operations in europe and japan the put option contracts were paid in full at execution and provide prologis with the option to exchange euro pound sterling and yen for us dollars at a fixed exchange rate such that if the euro pound sterling or yen were to depreciate against the us dollar to predetermined levels as set by the contracts prologis could exercise its options and mitigate its foreign currency exchange losses the outstanding contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and were markedtomarket through results of operations at december 31 2003 in 2003 prologis recognized aggregate expense of 27 million on various put option contracts including marktomarket gains of 02 million   at december 31 2003 prologis had an outstanding foreign currency forward swap contract that is designated as a net investment hedge of certain of its investments in europe the notional amount of the contract is 375 million euro the currency equivalent of approximately 474 million at december 31 2003 the contract allows prologis to sell euro at a fixed exchange rate to the us dollar and is settled at maturity at december 31 2003 prologis had outstanding two interest rate swap contracts related to anticipated transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges the aggregate notional amounts of the contracts are 750 million euro the currency equivalent of approximately 947 million at december 31 2003 the contracts allow prologis to fix the interest rate associated with a portion of a debt instrument forecasted to be issued in 2004 for a sevenyear period the foreign currency forward swap contract and the interest rate swap contracts qualify for hedge accounting treatment prologis recognized marktomarket adjustments representing a net decrease in the values of these contracts of 03 million in other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity at december 31 2003 

funds from operations   funds from operations is a financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry although nareit has published a definition of funds from operations modifications to the nareit calculation of funds from operations are common among reits as companies seek to provide performance measures that meaningfully reflect their business funds from operations as defined by prologis is presented as a 65 supplemental performance measure funds from operations is not used by prologis as nor should it be considered to be an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of prologis’ operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of prologis’ ability to fund its cash needs 

  funds from operations is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor does prologis intend it to present a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance prologis believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that funds from operations is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings further prologis believes that its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance   nareit’s funds from operations measure adjusts net earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated properties prologis agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons    at the same time that nareit created and defined its funds from operations concept for the reit industry it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community” prologis believes that financial analysts potential investors and shareholders who review its operating results are best served by a defined funds from operations measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of funds from operations   the prologis defined funds from operations measure excludes the following items from net earnings computed under gaap that are not excluded in the nareit defined funds from operations measure i deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by prologis’ taxable subsidiaries ii certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from certain debt transactions between prologis and its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and its foreign unconsolidated investees iii foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement based on current foreign currency exchange rates of certain third party debt of prologis’ foreign consolidated subsidiaries and its foreign unconsolidated investees and iv marktomarket adjustments associated with derivative financial instruments utilized to manage prologis’ foreign currency risks funds from operations of prologis’ unconsolidated investees is calculated on the same basis as prologis   the items that prologis excludes from net earnings while not infrequent or unusual are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative effects on prologis’ results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions most importantly the economics underlying the items that prologis excludes from net earnings are not the primary drivers in management’s decisionmaking process and capital investment decisions period to period fluctuations in these items can be driven by accounting for shortterm factors that are not relevant to longterm investment decisions longterm capital 66 structures or to longterm tax planning and tax structuring decisions accordingly prologis believes that investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of prologis’ operating results along the same lines that prologis’ management uses in planning and executing its business strategy 

  real estate is a capitalintensive business investors’ analyses of the performance of real estate companies tend to be centered on understanding the asset value created by real estate investment decisions and understanding current operating returns that are being generated by those same investment decisions the adjustments to net earnings that are included in arriving at the prologis defined funds from operations measure are helpful to management in making real estate investment decisions and evaluating its current operating performance prologis believes that these adjustments are also helpful to industry analysts potential investors and shareholders in their understanding and evaluation of prologis’ performance on the key measures of net asset value and current operating returns generated on real estate investments   funds from operations attributable to common shares as defined by prologis was 4007 million 3930 million and 2812 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the reconciliations of funds from operations attributable to common shares as defined by prologis to net earnings attributable to common shares computed under gaap are as follows for the periods indicated in thousands of us dollars  67  

risk factors   prologis’ operations involve various risks that could adversely affect prologis’ financial condition results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of prologis’ common shares these risks include among others 

 

 

 

   prologis is exposed to the general economic conditions and the local regional national and international economic conditions that affect the markets in which it owns properties prologis’ operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which it has concentrations of properties prologis does not have in excess of 10 of its directly owned portfolio in any one market nor does it have in excess of 10 of its total portfolio including properties owned by the property funds in any one market however prologis does have significant holdings in atlanta chicago dallas ft worth houston los angeles paris san francisco and certain markets in the united kingdom prologis’ operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions in the markets with concentrations of properties such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space become less favorable any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction of demand for distribution space could adversely affect prologis’ results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of prologis’ common shares 

 

   real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk while prologis seeks to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of its portfolio market research and its property management capabilities these risks cannot be eliminated the factors that can affect real estate values include  

 

   prologis’ investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector this concentration may expose prologis to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if prologis’ business activities included other types of real estate investments 68 

 

   prologis has developed a significant number of distribution properties since its inception and intends to continue to pursue development activities as opportunities arise such development activities generally require various government and other approvals and prologis may not receive such approvals prologis will be subject to risks associated with such development activities including but not limited to  

 

   prologis has contributed to property funds or sold to third parties a significant number of distribution properties in recent years prologis intends to continue to contribute and sell properties as opportunities arise particularly from its cdfs business segment prologis’ ability to contribute or sell properties on advantageous terms is dependent upon several factors some of which are beyond the control of prologis’ management primarily competition from other owners of distribution properties that are trying to dispose of their properties prologis’ ability to develop and timely lease properties will impact prologis’ ability to contribute or sell these properties continued access to private debt and equity capital by the property funds is necessary in order for prologis to continue its strategy of contributing properties to the property funds should prologis not have sufficient properties available that meet the investment criteria of current or future property funds or should the property funds have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms then these contributions could be delayed resulting in adverse effects on prologis’ liquidity and on its ability to meet projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period failure to meet its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period could have an adverse effect on prologis’ results of operations distributable cash flow and on the value of prologis’ common shares further prologis’ inability to redeploy the proceeds from its divestitures in accordance with its investment strategy could have an adverse affect on prologis’ results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of its common shares in subsequent periods 

 

   prologis acquires distribution properties from time to time the acquisition of properties involves risks including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and the risk that any actual costs for rehabilitation repositioning renovation and improvements identified in the preacquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates there is and it is expected that there will continue to be significant competition for investment opportunities that meet prologis’ investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities if necessary 

 

   prologis’ results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of its common shares would be adversely affected if a significant number of prologis’ tenants are unable to meet their lease obligations to prologis in the event of default by a significant number of tenants prologis may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing its rights as landlord 69 

 

   prologis’ results of operations distributable cash flow and the value of its common shares would be adversely affected if prologis is unable to lease on economically favorable terms a significant amount of space in its distribution properties prologis had 43 million square feet of distribution space with leases that either expired on december 31 2003 or were on a monthtomonth basis at that date and prologis has 214 million square feet of distribution space out of a total of 1111 million occupied square feet of distribution space with leases that expire in 2004 in its directly owned properties the property funds had a combined 15 million square feet of distribution space with leases that either expired on december 31 2003 or were on a monthtomonth basis at that date and the property funds have a combined 54 million square feet of distribution space out of a total of 926 million occupied square feet of distribution space with leases that expire in 2004 the number of distribution properties in a market or submarket could adversely affect both prologis’ ability to release distribution space and the rental rates that can be obtained in new leases 

 

   real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may tend to limit prologis’ ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions in addition significant expenditures associated with real estate investments such as mortgage payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments like other companies qualifying as reits under the code prologis must comply with the safe harbor rules relating to the number of properties that can be disposed of in a year the tax bases and the costs of improvements made to these properties and meet other tests which enable a reit to avoid punitive taxation on the sale of assets thus prologis’ ability at any time to sell assets or contribute assets to property funds or other entities in which prologis has an ownership interest may be restricted 

 

   prologis and its unconsolidated investees currently carry comprehensive insurance coverage including property liability fire flood earthquake environmental terrorism extended coverage and rental loss as appropriate for the markets where each of their properties and their business operations are located the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties business activities and markets prologis believes its properties and the properties of its unconsolidated investees are adequately insured however there are certain losses including losses from floods and losses from earthquakes acts of war acts of terrorism or riots that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed to be economically feasible or prudent to do so if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of prologis’ properties prologis could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property 

 

   under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at on under or in its property the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous substances prologis conducts phase i environmental assessments as part of its due diligence activities prologis has not been notified nor is prologis aware of any environmental condition with respect to its real estate assets that are likely to be material to prologis’ financial condition however prologis cannot give any assurance that such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future the presence of such substances on prologis’ real estate investments could adversely affect its ability to sell such investments or to borrow using such investments as collateral and may also have an adverse effect on prologis’ distributable cash flow 70 

 

 

 

   prologis as a reit is required to distribute at least 90 of its taxable income to its shareholders consequently prologis is as are all reits largely dependent on external capital to fund its development and acquisition activities prologis has been accessing private debt and equity capital through the establishment of property funds that acquire properties from prologis prologis’ ability to access private debt and equity capital through its property funds on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors including general market conditions and competition from other real estate companies further prologis generates significant profits as a result of the contributions of properties to the property funds to the extent that private capital is not available to the property funds to allow them to acquire properties from prologis these profits may not be realized or their realization may be delayed which could result in an earnings stream that is less predictable than some of prologis’ competitors and result in prologis not meeting its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period failure to meet its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period could have an adverse effect on the value of common shares   prologis is committed to offer to contribute its stabilized developed properties available in specific markets in europe to prologis european properties fund through september 2019 and all of its stabilized developed properties available in japan to prologis japan properties fund through june 2006 prologis believes that while the current capital commitments and borrowing capacities of these property funds will be expended prior to the expiration dates of these commitments each property fund does have sufficient capital to acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available during 2004   prologis’ commitment to offer to contribute certain of its stabilized developed properties in north america to prologis north american properties fund v expired at the end of 2003 however prologis north american properties fund v did acquire two properties from prologis in january 2004 while prologis north american properties fund v’s majority owner is a listed property trust in australia that is able to raise capital in the public market there can be no assurance that prologis north american properties fund v will have the available capital to acquire additional properties from prologis in 2004 or if capital is available that prologis north american properties fund v will want to use its capital to acquire properties from prologis further there can be no assurance that prologis will offer to contribute additional properties to prologis north american properties fund v   prologis’ ability to contribute or sell its development pipeline and recognize profits from its development activities will be jeopardized and prologis’ ability to meet its projected earnings levels and generate distributable cash flow would be adversely affected should the existing equity commitments not be available due to investor default or otherwise such that these property funds can acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available for contribution this impact would occur in the shortterm and would continue until prologis is able to sell the properties to third parties or until prologis could secure another source of private equity capital to form a new property fund 

 

   prologis currently has a policy of incurring debt only if upon such incurrence prologis’ debttobook capitalization ratio as adjusted would not exceed 50 the board could alter or eliminate this policy without shareholder approval and would do so if for example it were necessary in order for prologis to continue with its investment strategy or to continue to meet the reit requirements of the code if this policy were changed prologis could become more highly leveraged resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect its distributable cash flow 

 

   prologis is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that prologis’ cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest there can be no assurance that prologis will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness that such refinancing would be on terms as 71 favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness or otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness 

  prologis utilizes the shortterm borrowing capabilities over 153 billion as of december 31 2003 provided by six credit agreements that provide revolving lines of credit facilities to prologis in addition to operating cash flow and proceeds from dispositions to fund its development acquisition and distribution requirements prologis’ six revolving lines of credits expire through 2007 1037 million of borrowing capacity expires during 2004 1000 million of borrowing capacity expires during 2005 5552 million of borrowing capacity expires during 2006 7741 million of borrowing capacity expires during 2007 these expiration dates consider extension periods that are at prologis’ option prologis’ ability to refinance these credit agreements in a timely manner and at favorable terms is dependent on several factors including but not limited to general economic conditions prologis’ credit ratings and interest rate levels prologis’ shortterm credit agreements bear interest at variable rates increases in interest rates would increase prologis’ interest expense under these agreements if prologis is unable to refinance its indebtedness at maturity or meet its payment obligations the amount of prologis’ distributable cash flow would be adversely affected 

 

   the terms of prologis’ various credit agreements and other indebtedness require prologis to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage these covenants may limit prologis’ flexibility in its operations and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if prologis has satisfied its payment obligations if prologis is unable to refinance its indebtedness at maturity or meet its payment obligations the amount of prologis’ distributable cash flow would be adversely affected 

 

 

 

   prologis elected to be taxed as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year ended december 31 1993 to maintain reit status prologis must meet a number of highly technical requirements on a continuing basis those requirements seek to ensure among other things that the gross income and investments of a reit are largely real estate related that a reit distributes substantially all its ordinary taxable income to shareholders on a current basis and that the reit’s equity ownership is not overly concentrated due to the complex nature of these rules the available guidance concerning interpretation of the rules the importance of ongoing factual determinations and the possibility of adverse changes in the law administrative interpretations of the law and changes in prologis’ business no assurance can be given that prologis will qualify as a reit for any particular year   if prologis fails to qualify as a reit it will be taxed as a regular corporation and distributions to shareholders will not be deductible in computing prologis’ taxable income the resulting corporate income tax liabilities could materially reduce the distributable cash flow to prologis’ shareholders and funds available for reinvestment moreover prologis might not be able to elect to be treated as a reit for the four taxable years after the year during which prologis ceased to qualify as a reit in addition if prologis later requalified as a reit it might be required to pay a full corporatelevel tax on any unrealized gains in its assets as of the date of requalification and to make distributions to shareholders equal to any earnings accumulated during the period of nonreit status in the absence of reit status distributions to shareholders would no longer be required 

 

   to maintain its qualification as a reit under the code prologis must annually distribute to its shareholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding the dividends paid deduction and its net capital gains this requirement limits prologis’ ability to accumulate capital prologis may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements difficulties in meeting the distribution requirements might arise due to competing demands for prologis’ funds or to timing differences 72 between tax reporting and cash receipts and disbursements because income may have to be reported before cash is received because expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed or because deductions may be disallowed or limited or the internal revenue service may make a determination that adjusts reported income in those situations prologis might be required to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements and interest and penalties could apply if prologis fails to make a required distribution it would cease to be taxed as a reit 

 

   prologis contributes properties to property funds and sells properties to third parties some of these contributions and sales are made from prologis’ taxable subsidiaries under the code if a disposition is deemed to be a prohibited transaction a 100 penalty tax on the resulting gain could be assessed the determination that a transaction constitutes a prohibited transaction is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction the internal revenue service could contend that certain contributions or sales of properties by prologis are prohibited transactions while prologis’ management does not believe that the internal revenue service would prevail in such a dispute if the internal revenue service successfully argued the matter the 100 penalty tax could be assessed against the gains from these transactions additionally any gain from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect prologis’ ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 

 

 

 

   prologis’ executive officers and other senior offices have a significant role in prologis’ success the ability of prologis to retain its management group or to attract suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave prologis is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market the loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their availability could adversely effect prologis’ financial condition and cash flow further such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets 

 

   the annual distribution rate on common shares as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of such common shares an increase in market interest rates may lead investors to demand a higher annual distribution rate that prologis has set which could adversely affect the value of prologis’ common shares 

 

   prologis has pursued and intends to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets and often invests in countries where the us dollar is not the national currency as a result prologis is subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar for example a significant depreciation in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where prologis has a significant investment may materially adversely affect prologis’ results of operations and the value of its common shares prologis attempts to mitigate any such effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and by entering into derivative contracts although there can be no assurance that such attempts will be successful 

 

   there are many laws and governmental regulations that are applicable to prologis its unconsolidated investees and their properties changes in these laws and governmental regulations or their interpretation by agencies or the courts could occur further economic and political factors including civil unrest governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders in the united states but primarily in the foreign countries in which prologis has invested can have a major impact on a global company such as prologis 73 








 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with prologis’ consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this report   some statements contained in this discussion are not historical facts but are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 because these forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which prologis operates management’s beliefs and assumptions made by management they involve uncertainties that could significantly impact prologis’ financial results words such as “expects” “anticipates” “intends” “plans” “believes” “seeks” “estimates” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements include discussions of strategy plans or intentions of management these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict the discussions concerning prologis’ expectations with respect to economic conditions in the geographic areas where it has operations and its ability to raise private capital and generate income in the cdfs business segment including the discussions with respect to prologis’ expectations as to the availability of capital in its existing property funds such that these property funds will be able to acquire prologis’ stabilized developed properties that are expected to be available for contribution in the future contain forwardlooking statements therefore actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forwardlooking statements factors that may affect outcomes and results include i changes in general economic conditions in prologis’ markets that could adversely affect demand for prologis’ properties and the creditworthiness of prologis’ customers ii changes in financial markets interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could adversely affect prologis’ cost of capital its ability to meet its financial needs and obligations and its results of operations iii increased or unanticipated competition for distribution properties in prologis’ markets iv the availability of private capital to prologis v geopolitical concerns and uncertainties and vi those additional factors discussed under “— risk factors” 43 

overview   a summary of the discussions that follow in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” is presented below 

 

  

 

  

critical accounting policies   a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity’s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management generally the judgment requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain of the accounting 44 policies discussed in note 2 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 those presented below have been identified by prologis as critical accounting policies 

 

   prologis’ consolidated financial statements include the accounts of prologis its wholly owned subsidiaries and its majorityowned and controlled subsidiaries and partnerships all entities in which prologis owns a majority voting interest are consolidated investments in entities in which prologis does not own a majority voting interest but over which prologis does have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method investments in entities in which prologis does not own a majority voting interest and over which prologis does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as appropriate management’s judgments with respect to its level of influence or control of each entity involves consideration of various factors including the form of prologis’ ownership interest its representation on the entity’s board of directors the size of its investment including loans and prologis’ ability to participate in policy making decisions management’s ability to correctly assess its influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in prologis’ consolidated financial statements and consequently its financial position and specific items in its results of operations that are used by its shareholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders to evaluate prologis   in january 2003 interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” was issued interpretation no 46 was revised in december 2003 the revised interpretation no 46 “fin 46r” is applicable to prologis for the interim period that ends after march 15 2004 fin 46r clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” and requires that prologis present the variable interest entities in which it has a majority variable interest on a consolidated basis in its financial statements prologis is continuing to assess the provisions of fin 46r and the impact to prologis of its adoption at this time prologis expects that it will consolidate its investments in tcl holding sa formerly frigoscandia holding sa “tcl holding” and csi frigo llc a company that holds the voting ownership interest in tcl holding as of january 1 2004 through december 31 2003 prologis has presented its investments in tcl holding and csi frigo llc under the equity method prologis’ combined effective ownership in these entities was 9975 at december 31 2003 prologis expects that it will continue to present its investments in all of its other unconsolidated investees under the equity method after fin 46r is adopted management’s ability to correctly assess its investments under the new rules with respect to variable interest entities will affect the presentation of these investments in prologis’ consolidated financial statements and consequently its financial position and specific items in its results of operations that are used by its shareholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders to evaluate prologis 

 

   prologis and its unconsolidated investees assess the carrying values of their respective longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable and with respect to goodwill at least annually applying a fairvaluebased test the determination of the fair values of longlived assets including goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on management’s analysis and estimates of the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each longlived asset management’s ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows impacts the determination of fair value   if there is a decline in the fair value of a longlived asset combined with a history of the asset generating operating losses prologis or its unconsolidated investees will be required to determine whether the operating losses associated with the asset will continue management’s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is primarily based on estimates of future operating results the resulting cash flows and prologis’ intent to either hold or dispose of the longlived asset if an investment is considered impaired a writedown is recognized based on these analyses 45 

 

   prologis recognizes gains and losses from the contributions and sales of real estate assets generally at the time the title is transferred and prologis has no future involvement as a direct owner of the real estate asset contributed or sold in certain transactions an entity in which prologis has an ownership interest will acquire a real estate asset from prologis management makes judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that prologis can recognize given its continuing ownership interest and its level of future involvement with the investee that acquires the assets management’s ability to accurately assess the provisions of each transaction under the accounting guidelines for profit recognition could impact prologis’ financial position and specific items in its results of operations that are used by shareholders potential investors industry analysts and lenders to evaluate prologis 

 

   prologis estimates the depreciable portion of its real estate assets and their related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense management’s ability to accurately estimate the depreciable portions of its real estate assets and their useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying values of the underlying assets any change to the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized by prologis 

results of operations   prologis’ net earnings attributable to common shares were 2124 million in 2003 2162 million in 2002 and 860 million in 2001 basic and diluted net earnings attributable to common shares were 118 and 116 per share respectively in 2003 122 and 120 per share respectively in 2002 and 050 and 049 per share respectively in 2001 

 

   in addition to its directly owned operating properties prologis includes its investments in the property funds that are presented under the equity method in its property operations segment see note 4 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 prologis owned operating properties directly or had ownership interests in operating properties through its investments in the property funds as follows as of the dates indicated square feet in thousands     see “item 2 properties — properties” and “item 2 properties — unconsolidated investees”   the operating income of prologis’ property operations segment consists of i rental income and rental expenses from the operating properties that are directly owned by prologis ii income recognized by prologis under the equity method from its investments in the property funds iii fees and other income earned by prologis for services performed on behalf of the property funds primarily property management and asset management services and iv interest earned on advances to the property funds if any the net earnings or losses generated by operating properties that were developed or acquired in the cdfs business segment are included in the property operations segment during the interim period that these properties are included in the property operations segment generally from the date of completion or acquisition through the date the properties are contributed or sold see “item 1 “business — prologis’ operating segments — 46 property operations” “item 1 business — prologis’ operating segments — cdfs business” and note 10 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 

  the amounts recognized under the equity method represent prologis’ proportionate share of the net earnings or loss of each property fund based on its ownership interest in the property fund the net earnings or losses of the property funds includes the following income and expense items in addition to rental income and rental expenses i interest income and interest expense ii depreciation and amortization expenses iii general and administrative expenses iv income taxes and v foreign currency exchange gains and losses with respect to prologis european properties fund see notes 4 and 10 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 prologis’ operating income from the property operations segment was as follows for the periods indicated in thousands of us dollars   47      48     the stabilized operating properties owned by prologis and the property funds were 902 leased at december 31 2003 912 leased at december 31 2002 and 931 leased at december 31 2001 prologis defines its stabilized properties as those properties where the capital improvements repositioning efforts new management and new marketing programs for acquisitions or the marketing programs in the case of newly developed properties have been completed and in effect for a sufficient period of time generally 12 months a property enters the stabilized pool at the earlier of 12 months or when it is substantially leased which is defined by prologis generally as 93   prologis believes that the reduction in its stabilized occupancy levels experienced in 2003 was primarily the result of weak economic conditions in the united states and certain western european countries that resulted in a slowing of customer leasing decisions and a slowing in the absorption of new distribution properties in many of prologis’ markets additionally prologis believes that geopolitical concerns and uncertainties primarily in europe in the early part of 2003 also contributed to the slower leasing activity prologis has not observed similar trends in japan prologis does not expect economic conditions to change significantly in 2004 while there were some positive trends in occupancy levels in certain markets in late 2003 prologis believes that occupancies will not increase significantly but that further declines in occupancies if any will not be significant prologis continues to believe that shifts in distribution patterns of its customers in europe and japan and their needs to reduce their distribution costs have been and will continue to be key drivers of leasing decisions in many of its european markets and in japan prologis believes that the diversification of its global operating platform and the prologis operating system have somewhat mitigated the effects of market occupancy decreases   rental rates in 2003 for both new and renewed leases for previously leased space 428 million square feet for all properties including those owned by the property funds decreased by 48 as compared to rental rate growth of 20 in 2002 and 146 in 2001 on similar transactions prologis believes that the negative rental rate growth experienced in 2003 is the result of decreased customer demand that negatively impacts the rental rates that can be charged in a particular market   prologis’ same store portfolio of operating properties properties owned by prologis and the property funds that were in operation throughout all of 2003 and 2002 aggregated 1793 million square feet prologis views the operating results of the same store portfolio as a key component in evaluating the performance of its properties its management personnel and its individual markets because this population is consistent from period to period thereby eliminating the effects on performance measures of changes in the composition of the portfolio net operating income defined for the same store analysis as rental income excluding termination and renegotiation fees less rental expenses generated by the same store portfolio increased by 009 in 2003 from 2002 in 2002 the net operating income of the same store portfolio applicable to that period decreased by 090 from 2001 the percentage change presented is the weighted average of the measure computed separately for prologis and each of the property funds with the weighting based on each entity’s proportionate share of the combined component on which the change is computed in order to derive an appropriate measure of periodtoperiod operating performance the percentage change computation removes the effects of 49 foreign currency exchange rate movements by computing each property’s components in that property’s functional currency 

  rental income computed under gaap applicable to the properties included in the same store portfolio is adjusted to remove the net termination and renegotiation fees recognized in each period net termination and renegotiation fees excluded from rental income were 16 million for directly owned properties and 12 million for properties owned by the property funds for 2003 125 million for directly owned properties and 63 million for properties owned by the property funds for 2002 and 17 million for directly owned properties and 003 million for properties owned by the property funds for 2001 net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate their lease offset by that customer’s rent leveling asset that has been previously recognized under gaap if any removing the net termination fees from the same store calculation of rental income allows prologis’ management to evaluate the growth or decline in each property’s rental income without regard to items that are not indicative of the property’s recurring operating performance customer terminations are negotiated under specific circumstances and are not subject to specific provisions or rights allowed under the lease agreements   in computing the percentage change in rental expenses the rental expenses applicable to the properties in the same store portfolio include property management expenses for prologis’ directly owned properties these expenses are based on the property management fee that is provided for in the individual agreements under which prologis’ wholly owned management company provides property management services to each property generally the fee is based on a percentage of revenues on consolidation the management fee income earned by the management company and the management fee expense recognized by the properties are eliminated and the direct costs of providing management services are recognized as part of prologis’ net rental expenses reported under gaap 

 

   operating income from prologis’ cdfs business segment consists primarily of i the gains and losses from the contributions and sales of developed properties and from the contributions of properties that were acquired with the intent to contribute the properties to a property fund including properties that have been rehabilitated andor repositioned ii gains and losses from the dispositions of land parcels iii development management fees earned by prologis for services provided to third parties and iv income recognized under the equity method from prologis’ investments in unconsolidated investees through june 30 2002 under the equity method prologis recognized its proportionate shares of the earnings of prologis uk holdings sa formerly kingspark holding sa collectively with its subsidiaries “kingspark sa” a luxembourg company that performs cdfs business activities in the united kingdom and kingspark llc a holding company that held the voting ownership interests of kingspark sa through june 30 2002 prologis began consolidating its investments in kingspark sa and kingspark llc on july 1 2002 see notes 2 and 4 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 prologis’ proportionate shares of the net earnings or losses recognized from its ownership interests in kingspark sa and kingspark llc includes in addition to net operating income i interest income and interest expense net of capitalized amounts ii general and administrative expenses net of capitalized amounts iii income taxes and iv foreign currency exchange gains and losses   income from the cdfs business segment is dependent on prologis’ ability to develop and timely lease properties or to acquire properties that can be contributed to property funds or sold to third parties generating profits to prologis and prologis’ success in raising private capital to acquire its properties through the formation of property funds or other sources in 2003 prologis’ operating income in this segment decreased from 2002 by 275 million this decrease was due to longer leaseup periods for prologis’ cdfs business segment properties as prologis observed a slowing of customers’ decisionmaking processes with respect to changes in their distribution networks prologis attributes the decreased leasing activity experienced in 2003 to economic weaknesses in many of its markets coupled with geopolitical concerns and uncertainties primarily in europe during the early part of 2003 there can be no assurance that prologis will be able to maintain or increase the current level of operating income in this operating segment prologis cannot predict the effect that any economic and other uncertainties will continue to have on its ability to lease its properties 50 or the length of time that such uncertainties will continue if prologis is unable to timely lease its completed developments it will be unable to contribute these properties to property funds or otherwise dispose of the properties and would be unable to recognize profits from its development activities in the anticipated reporting period see “item 1 prologis — prologis’ operating segments — cdfs business — future plans” “— risk factors — general real estate risks — risks associated with the contribution and sale of properties” and “— risk factors — financing and capital risks — access to capital” 

  prologis’ operating income from the cdfs business segment decreased in 2003 from 2002 and 2001 levels the cdfs business segment’s operating income includes the following components for the periods indicated in thousands of us dollars    had prologis presented its investments in kingspark sa and kingspark llc on a consolidated basis for all of 2002 and 2001 prologis’ cdfs business segment’s operating income would have been as follows in thousands of us dollars     51        since 1999 prologis’ focus in the cdfs business segment reflects the economic and market conditions in the areas in which it owns properties accordingly there has been a shift of prologis’ cdfs business activity since 2000 in favor of japan prologis’ cdfs business segment assets were located in north america 35 and europe 65 at december 31 2000 at december 31 2003 prologis’ cdfs business segment 52 assets were located in north america 22 europe 57 and japan 21 the operating income of the cdfs business segment was earned as follows for 2003 2002 and 2001 

   see note 10 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8   prologis will continue to monitor leasing activity and general economic conditions in the united states as it pertains to its cdfs business segment operations with the expectation that such an economic recovery could provide increased cdfs business opportunities to prologis as companies continue optimizing their supply chains prologis believes that the continued demand for stateoftheart distribution properties in europe could result in the acceleration of leasing decisions that could provide opportunities for prologis in the cdfs business segment however prologis will continue to monitor the impacts of economic and other uncertainties that negatively impacted leasing in europe during 2003 prologis believes its development activities will not be significantly affected by land entitlement constraints that currently exist in europe because it has almost 1900 acres of land owned or controlled in europe at december 31 2003 and its personnel are experienced in the land entitlement process as in europe prologis believes that demand for stateoftheart distribution properties in japan will continue to provide opportunities for prologis in the cdfs business segment prologis has not observed similar trends in japan with respect to economic and other uncertainties in japan the cdfs business opportunities available to prologis will be limited if prologis is unable to acquire adequate land parcels for development 

 

 

 

   general and administrative expense was 659 million in 2003 539 million in 2002 and 503 million in 2001 had prologis presented its investments in kingspark sa and kingspark llc on a consolidated basis for all of 2002 and 2001 prologis would have recognized general and administrative expense of 555 million and 520 million for 2002 and 2001 respectively general and administrative expense is primarily a function of the various business initiatives being undertaken in a given period and can vary from year to year based on prologis’ business activities also the average foreign currency exchange rate used to translate to us dollars the general and administrative expense recognized by prologis’ european subsidiaries prior to consolidation was significantly higher in 2003 as compared to 2002 and 2001 for a discussion of the presentation of prologis’ investments in kingspark sa and kingspark llc see notes 2 and 4 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

   amounts recognized by prologis under the equity method from its investments in unconsolidated investees that operate temperaturecontrolled distribution networks and are not included in one of prologis’ two operating segments were as follows for the periods presented in thousands of us dollars for a 53 discussion of these unconsolidated investees see note 4 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8 

  

 

 

 

   amounts recognized by prologis under the equity method from its investments in unconsolidated investees that do not own and operate real estate assets were as follows for the periods indicated in thousands 54 of us dollars for a discussion of these unconsolidated investees see note 4 to prologis’ consolidated financial statements in item 8

   prologis’ common share distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of its cash flow that ensures that prologis will meet the distribution requirements of the code and that allows prologis to maximize the cash retained to meet other cash needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities because depreciation is a noncash expense cash flow typically will be greater than operating income and net earnings   cash distributions per common share paid in 2003 2002 and 2001 were 144 142 and 138 respectively the board set a projected annual distribution rate for 2004 of 146 per common share prologis paid a distribution for the first quarter of 2004 of 0365 per common share on february 27 2004 to holders of common shares at february 13 2004 the payment of common share distributions is subject to the discretion of the board is dependent on prologis’ financial condition and operating results and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year prologis has increased its common share distribution level every year since its common shares became publicly traded in 1994   at december 31 2003 prologis had four series of preferred shares outstanding the annual dividend rates on prologis’ preferred shares are 427 per series c preferred share 198 per series d preferred share 169 per series f preferred share and 169 per series g preferred share the series d preferred shares were redeemed in january 2004   pursuant to the terms of its preferred shares prologis is restricted from declaring or paying any distribution with respect to its common shares unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred shares have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the then current dividend period with respect to the preferred shares 

 

   at december 31 2003 prologis had letters of intent or contingent contracts subject to prologis’ final due diligence for the acquisition of properties aggregating 50 million square feet at an estimated total acquisition cost of 2203 million through february 29 2004 prologis completed the acquisitions of seven of these properties aggregating 09 million square feet at a total acquisition cost of 315 million the remaining transactions are subject to a number of conditions and prologis cannot predict with certainty that they will be consummated   under a common share repurchase program prologis may repurchase up to 2150 million of common shares the common shares that have been repurchased to date were purchased in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions depending on market prices and other conditions future repurchases if any are expected to be through similar transactions through march 5 2004 prologis has repurchased 5571000 common shares under this program at a total cost of 1309 million an additional 841 million of common shares may be repurchased under the program as march 5 2004 prologis does not currently expect that it will make significant common share repurchases in 2004   prologis from time to time enters into special limited contribution agreements “slca” in connection with certain of its contributions of properties to certain of its property funds under the slcas prologis is obligated to make an additional capital contribution to the respective property fund under certain circumstances the occurrence of which prologis believes to be remote specifically prologis would be required to make an additional capital contribution if the property fund’s thirdparty lender whose loans to the property fund are generally secured by the property fund’s assets and are nonrecourse does not receive a specified minimum level of debt repayment however the proceeds received by the thirdparty lender from the exhaustion of all of the assets of the property fund combined with the debt repayments received directly from the property fund will reduce prologis’ obligations under the slca on a dollarfordollar basis prologis’ potential obligations under the respective slcas as a percentage of the assets in the property funds range from 2 to 28 accordingly the value of the assets of the respective property funds would have to decline by between 98 and 72 before prologis would be required to make an additional capital contribution prologis believes that the likelihood of declines in the values of the assets that support the thirdparty loans of the magnitude necessary to require an additional capital contribution is remote especially in 64 light of the geographically diversified portfolios of properties owned by the property funds accordingly these potential obligations have not been recognized as a liability by prologis at december 31 2003 and prologis has assessed a nominal value to the guarantee undertaken through the slcas the potential obligations under the slcas aggregate 3578 million at december 31 2003 and the combined book value of the assets in the property funds before depreciation that are subject to the provisions of the slcas was approximately 52 billion at december 31 2003 

 

   prologis uses derivative financial instruments as hedges to manage welldefined risk associated with interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on existing or anticipated obligations and transactions prologis does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes   the primary risks associated with derivative instruments are market risk and credit risk market risk is defined as the potential for loss in the value of the derivative due to adverse changes in market prices interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates the use of derivative financial instruments allows prologis to manage the risks of increases in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the effects these fluctuations would have on prologis’ income and cash flows   credit risk is the risk that one of the parties to a derivative contract fails to perform or meet their financial obligation under the contract prologis does not obtain collateral to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of counterparties primarily global commercial banks prologis does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties to its derivative contracts however should a counterparty fail to perform prologis would incur a financial loss to the extent of the positive fair market value of the derivative contracts if any   at december 31 2003 prologis had foreign currency put option contracts outstanding in the notional amount of 284 million euro 77 million pound sterling and 8744 million yen the aggregate currency equivalent of approximately 579 million at december 31 2003 related to its operations in europe and japan the put option contracts were paid in full at execution and provide prologis with the option to exchange euro pound sterling and yen for us dollars at a fixed exchange rate such that if the euro pound sterling or yen were to depreciate against the us dollar to predetermined levels as set by the contracts prologis could exercise its options and mitigate its foreign currency exchange losses the outstanding contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and were markedtomarket through results of operations at december 31 2003 in 2003 prologis recognized aggregate expense of 27 million on various put option contracts including marktomarket gains of 02 million   at december 31 2003 prologis had an outstanding foreign currency forward swap contract that is designated as a net investment hedge of certain of its investments in europe the notional amount of the contract is 375 million euro the currency equivalent of approximately 474 million at december 31 2003 the contract allows prologis to sell euro at a fixed exchange rate to the us dollar and is settled at maturity at december 31 2003 prologis had outstanding two interest rate swap contracts related to anticipated transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges the aggregate notional amounts of the contracts are 750 million euro the currency equivalent of approximately 947 million at december 31 2003 the contracts allow prologis to fix the interest rate associated with a portion of a debt instrument forecasted to be issued in 2004 for a sevenyear period the foreign currency forward swap contract and the interest rate swap contracts qualify for hedge accounting treatment prologis recognized marktomarket adjustments representing a net decrease in the values of these contracts of 03 million in other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity at december 31 2003 

funds from operations   funds from operations is a financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry although nareit has published a definition of funds from operations modifications to the nareit calculation of funds from operations are common among reits as companies seek to provide performance measures that meaningfully reflect their business funds from operations as defined by prologis is presented as a 65 supplemental performance measure funds from operations is not used by prologis as nor should it be considered to be an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of prologis’ operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of prologis’ ability to fund its cash needs 

  funds from operations is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor does prologis intend it to present a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance prologis believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that funds from operations is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings further prologis believes that its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance   nareit’s funds from operations measure adjusts net earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated properties prologis agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons    at the same time that nareit created and defined its funds from operations concept for the reit industry it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community” prologis believes that financial analysts potential investors and shareholders who review its operating results are best served by a defined funds from operations measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of funds from operations   the prologis defined funds from operations measure excludes the following items from net earnings computed under gaap that are not excluded in the nareit defined funds from operations measure i deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by prologis’ taxable subsidiaries ii certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from certain debt transactions between prologis and its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and its foreign unconsolidated investees iii foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement based on current foreign currency exchange rates of certain third party debt of prologis’ foreign consolidated subsidiaries and its foreign unconsolidated investees and iv marktomarket adjustments associated with derivative financial instruments utilized to manage prologis’ foreign currency risks funds from operations of prologis’ unconsolidated investees is calculated on the same basis as prologis   the items that prologis excludes from net earnings while not infrequent or unusual are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative effects on prologis’ results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions most importantly the economics underlying the items that prologis excludes from net earnings are not the primary drivers in management’s decisionmaking process and capital investment decisions period to period fluctuations in these items can be driven by accounting for shortterm factors that are not relevant to longterm investment decisions longterm capital 66 structures or to longterm tax planning and tax structuring decisions accordingly prologis believes that investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of prologis’ operating results along the same lines that prologis’ management uses in planning and executing its business strategy 

  real estate is a capitalintensive business investors’ analyses of the performance of real estate companies tend to be centered on understanding the asset value created by real estate investment decisions and understanding current operating returns that are being generated by those same investment decisions the adjustments to net earnings that are included in arriving at the prologis defined funds from operations measure are helpful to management in making real estate investment decisions and evaluating its current operating performance prologis believes that these adjustments are also helpful to industry analysts potential investors and shareholders in their understanding and evaluation of prologis’ performance on the key measures of net asset value and current operating returns generated on real estate investments   funds from operations attributable to common shares as defined by prologis was 4007 million 3930 million and 2812 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the reconciliations of funds from operations attributable to common shares as defined by prologis to net earnings attributable to common shares computed under gaap are as follows for the periods indicated in thousands of us dollars  67  


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk   prologis is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates prologis has used certain derivative financial instruments primarily foreign currency put option contracts to reduce its foreign currency market risk to a lesser extent prologis has used interest rate swap agreements to reduce its interest rate market risk prologis does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with polices that have been approved by the board   prologis has estimated its market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis prologis has defined its market risk exposure as i the potential loss in future earnings and cash flows due to interest rate exposure and ii the future loss in future earnings with respect to foreign currency exchange exposure prologis’ sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in year end interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value as a result prologis’ ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates 

 

   prologis’ interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to achieve its objective for longerterm debt prologis borrows on a fixed rate basis in anticipation of a financing expected to occur in 2004 prologis entered into two forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the interest rate on a portion of the expected financing if the expected financing occurs in the projected time frame any increase in interest rates would be offset by the positive value of the contracts and any decrease in interest rates would be offset by the negative value of the contracts in each case for the hedged amount of the expected financing if the expected financing did not occur and the contracts were unwound based on the results of the sensitivity analysis which assumed a 10 adverse change in interest rates the estimated market risk exposure for the forwardstarting interest rate swap contracts would be approximately 23 million for both future earnings and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2003   prologis’ primary interest rate risk is created by its variable rate lines of credit during the year ended december 31 2003 prologis had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of 6200 million on its variable rate revolving lines of credit based on the results of the sensitivity analysis which assumed a 10 adverse change in interest rates the estimated market risk exposure for prologis’ variable rate revolving lines of credit was approximately 14 million for both future earnings and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2003 the sensitivity analysis was based on the weighted average outstanding variable rate borrowings for 2003 and assumed a flat yield curve for the year although prologis has no derivative contracts as hedges of its variable rate revolving lines of credit prologis may in the future fix existing variable rate borrowings to manage its interest rate exposure 

 

   prologis primarily uses foreign currency put option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the projected net operating income operating income net of foreign denominated interest expense of its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees in addition prologis incurs foreign currency exchange risk related to thirdparty and intercompany debt of its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and its foreign unconsolidated investees that are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary or investee the remeasurement of certain of this debt results in the recognition of foreign currency exchange gains or losses by prologis prologis’ primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rates exists with the following currencies versus the us dollar euro pound sterling and yen based on the results of a sensitivity analysis which assumed a 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates the estimated market risk exposure to future earnings associated with this debt was 1367 million at december 31 2003 74   prologis translates to us dollars the income and expenses of its consolidated foreign subsidiaries and its proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of its unconsolidated investees recognized under the equity method prologis hedges the foreign currency exchange risk associated with approximately 50 to 75 of the forecasted net operating income from its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees through foreign currency put option contracts the effect of the change in foreign currency exchange rates on translated income and expenses of prologis’ foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees has a high degree of inverse correlation with the derivative instruments used to hedge it since prologis hedges approximately 50 to 75 of its projected net operating income from its foreign subsidiaries and investees approximately 25 to 50 of the impact to the net earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and investees of an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates would not be offset by derivative instruments   the foreign currency put options are entered into on a quarterly basis such that prologis generally has twelve months of net operating income hedged at 50 to 75 of forecasted net operating income under the contracts assuming a 10 increase and a 10 decrease in foreign currency exchange rates for the sensitivity analysis the estimated market risk exposure to future earnings for the foreign currency option contracts would be 09 million and 02 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2003 as the foreign currency put option contracts are paid in full at inception the maximum charge to future earnings for the contracts themselves is limited to the prepaid premiums   prologis has also entered into a foreign currency forward contract related to prologis’ investment in europe the contract allows prologis to sell euro at a fixed exchange rate to the us dollar with a maturity date of april 15 2004 the contract was entered into in anticipation of a financing that is expected to occur in 2004 if the foreign currency forward contract were unwound prior to maturity a sensitivity analysis that assumes a 10 increase in the euro results in estimated market risk exposure for the foreign currency forward contract of approximately 51 million to both future earnings and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2003 

 

   the following estimates of the fair value of financial instruments have been determined by prologis using available market information and valuation methodologies believed to be appropriate for these purposes considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and accordingly they are not necessarily indicative of amounts that prologis would realize upon disposition   at december 31 2003 and 2002 the carrying amounts of certain financial instruments employed by prologis including cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses were representative of their fair values due to the shortterm maturity of these instruments similarly the carrying values of the revolving lines of credit balances outstanding approximate their fair values as of those dates since the interest rates on the revolving lines of credit are based on current market rates at december 31 2003 and 2002 the fair values of prologis’ senior unsecured debt secured debt including mortgage notes and securitized debt and assessment bonds have been estimated based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or by discounting the future cash flows using rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities the differences in the fair values of prologis’ senior unsecured debt secured debt and assessment bonds from the carrying values in the table below are the result of differences in the interest rates available to prologis at december 31 2003 and 2002 from the interest rates that were in effect when the debt was issued the senior unsecured debt and many of the secured debt issues contain prepayment penalties or yield maintenance provisions that could make the cost of refinancing the debt exceed the benefit that would be derived from refinancing at the lower rates   at december 31 2003 and 2002 the fair values of prologis’ derivative financial instruments are the amounts at which they could be settled based on quoted market prices or estimates obtained from brokers or dealers as prologis marks its derivative financial instruments to market their fair values are the same as their carrying values the carry value of the foreign currency forward contract is included as other liabilities and the carrying values of the foreign currency put option contracts and the interest rate swap contracts are included as other assets in prologis’ consolidated balance sheet 75   the following table reflects the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of prologis’ financial instruments as of the periods indicated in thousands of us dollars

  as of december 31 2002 we had two retail centers four industrial properties and two development properties that we are holding for divestiture over the next few years we intend to dispose of nonstrategic assets and redeploy the resulting capital into industrial properties in supplyconstrained markets in the us and internationally that better fit our current investment focus   we are selfadministered and selfmanaged and expect that we have qualified and will continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ending december 31 1997 as a selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust our own employees perform our administrative and management functions rather than our relying on an outside manager for these services our principal executive office is located at pier 1 bay 1 san francisco california 94111 our telephone number is 415 3949000 we also maintain regional offices in boston massachusetts and amsterdam the netherlands as of december 31 2002 we employed 184 individuals 141 at our san francisco headquarters 42 in our boston office and one in our amsterdam office our website address is wwwambcom  our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the exchange act are available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission   the following marks are our registered trademarks amb® broker alliance partners® broker alliance program® customer alliance partners® customer alliance program® development alliance partners® development alliance program® htd® high throughput distribution® institutional alliance partners® institutional alliance program® management alliance partners® management alliance program® strategic alliance partners® upreit alliance partners® and upreit alliance program® the following mark is our unregistered trademark strategic alliance programs™ coinvestment joint ventures   through the operating partnership we enter into coinvestment joint ventures with institutional investors these coinvestment joint ventures provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions development projects and renovation projects as well as private capital income which enhances our returns as of december 31 2002 we had investments in five coinvestment joint ventures with a gross book value of 16 billion which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes acquisition development and disposition activity   during 2002 we invested 4033 million in operating properties consisting of 43 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 54 million square feet and a parking lot adjacent to los angeles international airport our acquisitions included the investment of 1665 million in 31 buildings aggregating approximately 31 million square feet through two of our coinvestment joint ventures   during 2002 we completed industrial developments valued at 1354 million aggregating approximately 31 million square feet we also initiated eight new industrial development projects valued at 906 million aggregating approximately 18 million square feet including new international industrial development projects valued at 503 million aggregating approximately 11 million square feet   as of december 31 2002 we had in our development pipeline ten industrial projects which will total approximately 17 million square feet and have an aggregate estimated investment of 1068 million upon completion and three development projects available for sale which will total approximately 06 million square feet and have an aggregate estimated investment of 491 million upon completion as of december 31 2002 3   we and our partners had funded an aggregate of 928 million and needed to fund an estimated additional 631 million in order to complete current and planned projects 

  during 2002 we disposed of 58 industrial buildings two retail buildings and an undeveloped retail land parcel aggregating approximately 57 million rentable square feet for an aggregate price of 2440 million during 2002 we also sold 769 million in operating properties consisting of 15 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 19 million square feet to one of our coinvestment joint ventures during 2002 we also completed and sold six buildings developed as part of our developmentforsale program for a net gain of 10 million operating strategy   we base our operating strategy on extensive operational and service offerings including inhouse acquisitions development redevelopment asset management leasing finance accounting and market research we leverage our expertise across a large customer base and have longstanding relationships with entrepreneurial real estate management and development firms in our target markets our strategic alliance partners®   we believe that real estate is fundamentally a local business and best operated by forging alliances with service providers in each target market we believe that this strategy results in a mutually beneficial relationship as these alliance partners provide us with highquality local market expertise and intelligence we in turn contribute value to the alliance relationship through national and global customer relationship development industry knowledge perspective and financial strength   while our alliance relationships give us local market benefits we retain flexibility to focus on our core competencies developing and executing our strategic approach to real estate investment and management and raising private capital to finance growth and enhance returns to stockholders growth strategies   growth through operations   we seek to generate internal growth through rent increases on existing space and renewals on rollover space we do this by seeking to maintain a high occupancy rate at our properties and by seeking to control expenses by capitalizing on the economies of owning operating and growing a large global portfolio as of december 31 2002 our industrial properties and retail centers were 946 leased and 886 leased respectively during 2002 average industrial base rental rates on a cash basis decreased by 10 from the expiring rent for that space on leases entered into or renewed during the period this amount excludes expense reimbursements rental abatements and percentage rents during 2002 we increased cashbasis samestore net operating income by 35 on our industrial properties since our initial public offering in november 1997 we have experienced average annual increases in industrial base rental rates on a cash basis of 145 and we have experienced average quarterly increases in industrial samestore net operating income on a cash basis of 65 while we believe that it is important to view real estate as a longterm investment past results are not necessarily an indication of future performance   while occupancy levels in our industrial portfolio were similar in 2002 and 2001 rents on lease renewals and rollovers were lower in 2002 as the general contraction in business activity nationwide caused a reduction in demand for industrial warehouse facilities this reduction in demand was evidenced by two significant factors decreases in national industrial occupancy levels and negative net absorption of industrial facility space specifically according to torto wheaton research at december 31 2001 national industrial occupancy was 902 by december 31 2002 national occupancy fell to 888 as reported by torto wheaton research national net absorption of industrial space the change in the amount of square footage leased in existing and newly constructed industrial properties was positive from 1989 through 2000 by contrast torto wheaton research reported that net absorption was negative by 152 million square feet in 2001 and 34 million square feet in 2002 in 2002 these factors combined to reduce market rents for industrial properties by approximately 15 to 20 nationally from peak levels at the beginning of 2001 while the level 4   of rental rate reduction varied by market we strove to maintain high occupancy by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions 

  growth through acquisitions and capital redeployment   we believe that our significant acquisition experience our alliancebased operating strategy and our extensive network of property acquisition sources will continue to provide opportunities for external growth we have forged relationships with thirdparty local property management firms through our management alliance program® we believe that these alliances will create acquisition opportunities as such managers market properties on behalf of sellers our operating structure also enables us to acquire properties through our upreit alliance program® in exchange for limited partnership units in the operating partnership thereby enhancing our attractiveness to owners and developers seeking to transfer properties on a taxdeferred basis in addition to acquisitions we seek to redeploy capital from nonstrategic assets into properties that better fit our current investment focus   we are generally in various stages of negotiations for a number of acquisitions and dispositions that may include acquisitions and dispositions of individual properties acquisitions of large multiproperty portfolios and acquisitions of other real estate companies there can be no assurance that we will consummate any of these transactions such transactions if we consummate them may be material individually or in the aggregate sources of capital for acquisitions may include undistributed cash flow from operations borrowings under our unsecured credit facility other forms of secured or unsecured debt financing issuances of debt or equity securities by us or the operating partnership including issuances of units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries proceeds from divestitures of properties assumption of debt related to the acquired properties and private capital from our coinvestment partners   growth through development   we believe that renovation and expansion of properties and development of welllocated highquality industrial properties should continue to provide us with attractive opportunities for increased cash flow and a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of fullyleased renovated properties valueadded properties are typically characterized as properties with available space or nearterm leasing exposure undeveloped land acquired in connection with another property that provides an opportunity for development or properties that are well located but require redevelopment or renovation valueadded properties require significant management attention or capital investment to maximize their return we believe that we have developed the inhouse expertise to create value through acquiring and managing valueadded properties and believe that our global market presence and expertise will enable us to continue to generate and capitalize on these opportunities through our development alliance program® we have established strategic alliances with global and regional developers to enhance our development capabilities   the multidisciplinary backgrounds of our employees should provide us with the skills and experience to capitalize on strategic renovation expansion and development opportunities several of our officers have extensive experience in real estate development both with us and with national development firms we generally pursue development projects in joint ventures with our development alliance partners this way we leverage the development skill access to opportunities and capital of such developers and we eliminate the need and expense of an extensive inhouse development staff under a typical joint venture agreement with a development alliance partner we would fund 95 of the construction costs and our partner would fund 5 however in certain cases we may own as little as 50 or as much as 98 of the joint venture upon completion we generally would purchase our partner’s interest in the joint venture we may also structure developments where we would own 100 of the asset with an incentive development fee to be paid upon completion to our development partner   growth through coinvestments   we coinvest with thirdparty partners some of whom may be clients of amb capital partners llc to the extent such partners commit new investment capital through partnerships limited liability companies or 5   joint ventures we currently use a coinvestment formula with each third party whereby we will own at least a 20 interest in all ventures in general we control all significant operating and investment decisions of our coinvestment entities we believe that our coinvestment program will continue to serve as a source of capital for acquisitions and developments and private capital income however there can be no assurance that it will continue to do so during 2002 we sold 769 million in operating properties consisting of 15 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 19 million square feet to one of our coinvestment joint ventures ambsgp lp we recognized a gain of 33 million related to this sale representing the portion of the sold properties acquired by the thirdparty coinvestor we also sold 30 of our interest in amb partners ii lp our coinvestment joint venture with the city and county of san francisco employees’ retirement system to our coinvestment joint venture partner we now own 20 of amb partners ii lp we recognized a gain of 63 million related to this sale 

  growth through developments for sale   the operating partnership through its taxable reit subsidiaries conducts a variety of businesses that include incremental income programs such as our development projects available for sale to third parties such development properties include valueadded conversion projects and buildtosell projects during 2002 we completed and sold six valueadded conversion buildings for a net gain of 10 million as of december 31 2002 we were developing three projects for sale to third parties during 2001 we completed and sold two valueadded conversion projects for a net gain of 132 million   growth through global expansion   over the next three to five years we expect to have from 10 to 15 of our assets invested in international markets our mexican target markets currently include mexico city guadalajara and monterrey our european target markets currently include paris amsterdam london frankfurt and madrid our asian target markets currently include singapore hong kong and tokyo in 2002 our first year of international operation we earned 07 million in rental revenues from our mexico city guadalajara and paris properties there are many factors that could cause our entry into target markets and future capital allocation to differ from our current expectations which are discussed under the subheading “our international growth is subject to special political and monetary risks” and elsewhere under the heading “business risks” in this report   we believe that expansion into target international markets represents a natural extension of our wellestablished strategy to invest in industrial markets with high population densities close proximity to large customer clusters and available labor pools and major distribution centers serving the global supply chain our expansion strategy mirrors our domestic focus on infill locations which are supplyconstrained submarkets with political economic or physical constraints to new development and land as a high percentage of total asset value becoming more valuable for higher and better use over time our international investments will extend our offering of high throughput distribution facilities for customers who value speedtomarket over storage specifically we are focused on customers whose business is derived from world aircargo flows a sector expected to grow significantly faster than world gdp growth in addition our investments target major consumer distribution markets and customers   we believe that our established customer relationships our contacts in the air cargo and logistics industries diligent underwriting of markets and investment considerations and our strategic alliance partnerships with knowledgeable localmarket property brokers developers and managers will assist us in competing internationally business risks   see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — business risks” for a complete discussion of the various risks that could adversely affect us 6

business strategies

  investment strategy

     our investment strategy is to become a leading provider of high throughput
distribution or htd properties located near key passenger and cargo airports
highway systems and ports in major metropolitan areas such as atlanta
chicago dallasfort worth northern new jerseynew york city the san francisco
bay area southern california miami and seattle within each of our markets
we focus our investments in infill submarkets infill submarkets are
characterized by supply constraints on the availability of land for competing
projects

     high throughput distribution facilities are designed to serve the
highspeed highvalue freight handling needs of todays supply chain as
opposed to functioning as longterm storage facilities we believe that the
rapid growth of the airfreight business and the outsourcing of supply chain
management to third party logistics companies are indicative of the changes that
are occurring in the supply chain and the manner in which goods are distributed
in addition we believe that inventory levels as a percentage of final sales are
falling and that goods are moving more rapidly through the supply chain as a
result we intend to focus our investment activities primarily on industrial
properties that we believe will benefit from these changes

  operating strategy

     we are a fullservice real estate company with inhouse expertise in
acquisitions development and redevelopment asset management and leasing

financing strategy

     to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the rapid deployment of
capital over market cycles we intend to operate with a debttototal market
capitalization ratio of approximately 45 or less although our organizational
documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur
additionally we intend to continue to structure our balance sheet to maintain
investmentgrade ratings we also intend to keep the majority of our assets
unencumbered to facilitate such ratings as of december 31 2000 our
debttototal market capitalization ratio was 379 and our debttototal book
capitalization ratio was 446

     we have a 500 million unsecured revolving credit agreement that currently
bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus 75 basis points we use available
borrowings under our unsecured credit facility for property acquisitions
developments and for general corporate purposes as of december 31 2000 the
available borrowings under our unsecured credit facility were 2840 million
excluding potential expansion capacity see managements discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and
capital resources and item 14 note 6 of notes to consolidated financial
statements included in this report

     currently our principal sources of working capital and funding for
acquisitions development expansion and renovation of our properties include
1 cash flow from operations 2 borrowings under our unsecured credit facility
3 other forms of secured or unsecured debt financing 4 proceeds from equity
or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership including issuances of
units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries and 5 proceeds from
divestitures of properties additionally our coinvestment program will also
serve as a significant source of capital for acquisitions and developments

  growth through operations

     we seek to generate internal growth through rent increases on existing
space and renewal on retenanted space by maintaining a high occupancy rate of
our properties and by controlling expenses by capitalizing on the economies of
owning operating and growing a large national portfolio as of december 31
2000 our industrial properties and retail centers were 964 leased and 932
leased respectively during the 12 months ended december 31 2000 we increased
average base rental rates on a cash basis by 265 from the expiring rent for
that space on leases entered into or renewed during such period representing
approximately 121 million rentable square feet annualized base rent represents
the monthly contractual amount under existing leases at the end of the year
multiplied by 12 this amount excludes expense reimbursements rental
abatements and percentage rents

  growth through acquisitions and capital redeployment

     we believe that our significant acquisition experience our alliancebased
operating strategy and our extensive network of property acquisition sources
will continue to provide opportunities for external growth we believe that our
relationship with third party local property management firms through our
management alliance program also will create acquisition opportunities as such
managers market properties on behalf of sellers our operating structure also
enables us to acquire properties through our upreit alliance program in exchange
for limited partnership units in the operating partnership thereby enhancing
our attractiveness to owners and developers seeking to transfer properties on a
taxdeferred basis in addition to acquisitions we seek to redeploy capital
from nonstrategic assets into properties that better fit our current investment
focus

     we are generally in various stages of negotiations for a number of
acquisitions and dispositions which may include acquisitions and dispositions
of individual properties acquisitions of large multiproperty portfolios and
acquisitions of other real estate companies there can be no assurance that we
will consummate any of these acquisitions such transactions if we consummate
them may be material individually or in the aggregate sources of capital for
acquisitions may include undistributed cash flow from operations borrowings
under the credit facility other forms of secured or unsecured debt financing
issuances of debt or equity securities by us or the operating partnership
including issuances of units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries
proceeds from divestitures of properties and assumption of debt related to the
acquired properties

  growth through development

     we believe that renovation and expansion of valueadded properties and
development of welllocated highquality industrial properties should continue
to provide us with attractive opportunities for increased cash flow and a higher
rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of fully leased renovated
properties valueadded properties are typically characterized as properties
with available space or nearterm leasing exposure undeveloped land acquired in
connection with another property that provides an opportunity for development
or properties that are welllocated but require redevelopment or renovation
valueadded properties require significant management attention or capital
investment to maximize their return we have developed the inhouse expertise to
create value through acquiring and managing valueadded properties and believe
that our national market presence and expertise will enable us to continue to
generate and capitalize on these opportunities through our development alliance
program we have established strategic alliances with national and regional
developers to enhance our development capabilities

     the multidisciplinary backgrounds of our employees provide us with the
skills and experience to capitalize on strategic renovation expansion and
development opportunities several of our officers have extensive experience in
real estate development both with us and with national development firms we
generally pursue development projects in joint ventures with local developers
this way we leverage the development skill access to opportunities and
capital of such developers transferring a significant amount of

the development risk to them and eliminating the need and expense of an inhouse
development staff under a typical joint venture agreement with a development
alliance partner we would fund 95 of the construction costs and our partner
would fund 5 upon completion we generally would purchase our partners
interest in the joint venture

     as of december 31 2000 we had committed to invest 2785 million to
develop an estimated 59 million rentable square feet approximately 2434
million of this investment is through our development alliance program see item

item 2 properties

     the properties that we owned as of december 31 2000 are divided into two
operating divisions consisting of 27 identifiable markets we have provided

of interest to our stockholders and does not reflect how we are operationally
managed see item 14 note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements

                             industrial properties

     at december 31 2000 we owned 862 industrial buildings aggregating
approximately 758 million rentable square feet located in 27 markets
nationwide our industrial properties accounted for 4143 million or 963 of
our total annualized base rent at december 31 2000 our industrial properties
were 964 leased to over 2850 customers the largest of which accounted for no
more than 13 of our annualized base rent from our industrial properties

     property characteristics our industrial properties which consist
primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple
customers are typically comprised of multiple buildings the following table
identifies characteristics of our typical industrial buildings

     lease terms our industrial properties are typically subject to lease on a
triple net basis in which customers pay their proportionate share of real
estate taxes insurance and operating costs or subject to leases on a
modified gross basis in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold
levels lease terms typically range from three to ten years with an average of
six years excluding renewal options the majority of the industrial leases do
not include renewal options

     overview of major target markets our industrial properties are located
near key passenger and air cargo airports key interstate highways and ports in
major metropolitan areas such as atlanta chicago dallasfort worth northern
new jersey the san francisco bay area southern california miami and seattle
we believe our industrial properties strategic location transportation network
and infrastructure and large consumer and manufacturing bases support strong
demand for industrial space according to statistics published by cb richard
ellistorto wheaton research the national hub markets listed below are six of
the nations eight largest warehouse markets and as of december 31 2000
comprised 432 of the warehouse inventory of the 47 industrial markets tracked
according to statistics published by regional financial associates as of
december 31 2000 the combined population of these markets was 456 million and
the amount of per capita warehouse space was 227 above the average for those
47 industrial markets

                                        6
page   8

     within these metropolitan areas our industrial properties are concentrated
in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established
relatively large submarkets which we believe should provide a higher rate of
occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere these infill
locations are typically near major passenger and air cargo facilities seaports
or convenient to major highways and rail lines and are proximate to a diverse
labor pool there is typically broad demand for industrial space in these
centrally located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of
industrial uses including warehouse distribution light assembly and
manufacturing we generally avoid locations at the periphery of metropolitan
areas where there are fewer supply constraints small metropolitan areas or
cities without a heavy concentration of warehouse activity typically have few
if any supplyconstrained locations those areas typified by significant
population densities a limited number of existing industrial customers and a
low availability of land which could be developed into competitive space for
additional industrial customers

     as of december 31 2000 our 862 industrial buildings were diversified
across 27 markets nationwide the average age of our industrial properties is 17
years since the property was built or substantially renovated which we

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

     you should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated
financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to
consolidated financial statements statements contained in this discussion that
are not historical facts may be forwardlooking statements you can identify
forwardlooking statements by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as
believes expects may will should seeks approximately
intends plans pro forma estimates or anticipates or the negative
of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases you can also identify
forwardlooking statements by discussions of strategy plans or intentions
forwardlooking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you
should not rely upon them as predictions of future events there is no assurance
that the events or circumstances reflected in forwardlooking statements will be
achieved or occur forwardlooking statements are necessarily dependent on
assumptions data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not
be able to realize them

     the following factors among others could cause actual results and future
events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the
forwardlooking statements

      defaults or nonrenewal of leases by tenants

      increased interest rates and operating costs

      our failure to obtain necessary outside financing

      difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting
       acquisitions

      our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations

      our failure to divest of properties that we have contracted to sell or to
       timely reinvest proceeds from any such divestitures

      risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction
       including construction delays cost overruns our inability to obtain
       necessary permits and public opposition to these activities

      our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate
       investment trust under the internal revenue code of 1986

      environmental uncertainties

      risks related to natural disasters

      financial market fluctuations

      risks arising from the california energy shortage

      changes in real estate and zoning laws and

      increases in real property tax rates

     our success also depends upon economic trends generally including interest
rates income tax laws governmental regulation legislation population
changes and those risk factors discussed in the section entitled business
risks in this report we caution you not to place undue reliance on
forwardlooking statements which reflect our analysis only and speak as of the
date of this report or as of the dates indicated in the statements

                                    general

     we commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in
connection with the completion of our initial public offering on november 26
1997 and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under sections
856 through 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 with our initial tax return
for the year ended december 31 1997 amb property corporation and the operating
partnership were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public
offering

                             results of operations

     the analysis below includes changes attributable to acquisitions
development activity and divestitures and the changes resulting from properties
that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods
excluding development properties prior to being stabilized defined as the
earlier of 90 leased or 12 months after receipt of the certificate of
occupancy we refer to these properties as the same store properties for the
comparison between 2000 and 1999 the same store properties consisted of
properties aggregating approximately 525 million square feet the properties
acquired in 1999 consisted of 154 buildings aggregating approximately 84
million square feet and the properties acquired during 2000 consisted of 145
buildings aggregating approximately 105 million square feet in 1999 property
divestitures consisted of 30 retail centers and 15 industrial buildings
aggregating approximately 66 million square feet and property divestitures
during 2000 consisted of 25 industrial buildings and one retail center
aggregating approximately 25 million square feet our future financial
condition and results of operations including rental revenues may be impacted
by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions our future
revenues and expenses may vary materially from their historical rates

from the incremental effect of cash rental rate increases fixed rent increases

primarily to increased alliance fund i acquisition fees interest income and

     the increase in interest expense was due primarily to the increase in the
outstanding balance under our unsecured credit facility the increase in
depreciation expense was primarily due to lower than normal depreciation expense
in 1999 and increases in our investments in real estate under the required
accounting for assets held for sale we discontinued depreciation of a
substantial portion of our retail portfolio after we committed to dispose of a
portion of the portfolio in march 1999 the decrease in general and
administrative expenses was due to increased allocations to our investment
management group partially offset by increased personnel costs

     the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher interest rates
and a full year of interest expense in 1999 attributable to our 4000 million
unsecured senior debt securities the increase in depreciation expense was
primarily due to our real estate acquisitions in 1998 and 1999 partially offset
by the discontinuation of depreciation on heldforsale retail assets internal
management costs of 77 million for 1998 were reclassified from property
operating expenses to general and administrative expenses to conform with the
1999 presentation the increase in general and administrative expenses was
primarily attributable to additional staffing that resulted from growth in our
portfolio and the change in our accounting policy for capitalizing internal
acquisition costs effective during the second quarter of 1998 we changed our
policy to expense all internal acquisition costs in accordance with eitf 9711

                        liquidity and capital resources

     we currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and
funding for acquisitions development expansion and renovation of properties
will include cash flow from operations borrowings under our unsecured credit
facility other forms of secured or unsecured financing proceeds from equity or
debt offerings by us or the operating partnership including issuances of
limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries and
net proceeds from divestitures of properties additionally our coinvestment
program will also serve as a source of capital for acquisitions and
developments we believe that our sources of working capital and our ability to
access private and public debt and equity capital are adequate for us to meet
our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future

  capital resources

     property divestitures in 2000 we sold 25 industrial buildings and one
retail center for an aggregate price of 1757 million these divestitures
resulted in an aggregate net gain of 70 million the joint venture that sold
the retail center carries an 875 interest only mortgage note receivable in the
principal amount of 790 million this mortgage note has a oneyear term and
has a oneyear extension option

     properties held for divestiture we have decided to divest ourselves of 33
industrial buildings and one retail center which are not in our core markets or
which do not meet our strategic objectives the divestitures of the properties
are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions
as of december 31 2000 the net carrying value of the properties held for
divestiture was 1971 million

     credit facilities in may 2000 the operating partnership entered into a
new 5000 million unsecured revolving credit agreement which replaced its
previous 5000 million credit facility which matured in november 2000 we are
the guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit
facility our credit facility is with morgan guaranty trust company of new york
as administrative agent and a syndicate of 12 other banks the new credit
facility matures in may 2003 has a oneyear extension option and is subject to
a 15 basis point annual facility fee the operating partnership has the ability
to increase available borrowings up to 7000 million by adding additional banks
to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their
commitments we use our unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions
and for general working capital requirements borrowings under our credit
facility currently bear interest at libor plus 75 basis points at december 31
2000 the outstanding balance on our unsecured credit facility

                                        25

was 2160 million and it bore interest at a weighted average rate of 75
monthly debt service payments on our credit facility are interest only the
total amount available under our credit facility fluctuates based upon the
borrowing base as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility at
december 31 2000 the remaining amount available under our unsecured credit
facility was 2840 million excluding the additional 2000 million of
potential additional capacity

     in addition we had an 800 million unsecured credit facility held through
our investment in the alliance fund i the debt was secured by the unfunded
capital commitments of the third party investors in the alliance reit i a
limited partner of the alliance fund i since there are no remaining unfunded
capital commitments the alliance fund i paid off the outstanding balance and
closed this credit facility in the third quarter

of common stock were returned to us and cancelled the cancelled shares of
common stock represent indirect interests in the operating partnership that were
reallocated from us thereby decreasing the number of shares of common stock
outstanding to other unitholders who had an ownership interest in our
predecessor including certain of our executive officers thereby increasing the
number of limited partnership units owned by partners other than us the total

     in order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the rapid
deployment of capital through market cycles we presently intend to operate with
a debttototal market capitalization ratio of approximately 45 or less
additionally we presently manage our capitalization in order to maintain an
investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt in spite of these
policies our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the
amount of indebtedness that we may incur accordingly our board of directors
could alter or eliminate these policies

     for the year ended december 31 2000 approximately 82 of our common
dividend was classified as ordinary taxable income and approximately 18
represented capital gains we had no return of capital we currently intend to
payout 100 of our taxable income including capital gains each year in the
form of dividends and distributions and to have no return of capital for federal
income tax purposes

     the anticipated size of our distributions using only cash from operations
will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due therefore we
intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt

or equity financings or property divestitures however we may not be able to
obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all

  capital commitments

     in addition to recurring capital expenditures and costs to renew or
retenant space as of december 31 2000 we are developing and renovating 19
industrial projects representing a total estimated investment of 3059 million
upon completion and three retail projects representing a total estimated
investment of 763 million upon completion of this total 1629 million had
been funded as of december 31 2000 and approximately 1430 million is
estimated to be required to complete current and planned projects we expect to
fund these expenditures with cash from operations borrowings under our credit
facility debt or equity issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures
we have no other material capital commitments

     during the year ended december 31 2000 we invested 7300 million in 145
operating industrial buildings aggregating approximately 105 million rentable
square feet we funded these acquisitions and initiated development and
renovation projects through borrowings under our credit facility cash debt and
equity issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures

funds from operations

     in addition to net income and adjusted net income we believe that funds
from operations or ffo as defined by the national association of real estate
investment trusts is an appropriate supplemental measure of performance for an
equity real estate investment trust while funds from operations is a relevant
and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment
trusts it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined
by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and it should
not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating liquidity
or operating performance further funds from operations as disclosed by other
real estate investment trusts may not be comparable

     the following table reflects the calculation of funds from operations for
the fiscal years ended december 31 dollars in thousands except share and per
share data

1 funds from operations or ffo is defined as income from operations before
    minority interest gains or losses from sale of real estate and
    extraordinary items plus real estate depreciation and adjustment to derive
    our pro rata share of the funds from operations of unconsolidated joint
    ventures less minority interests pro rata share of the funds from
    operations of consolidated joint ventures and perpetual preferred stock
    dividends in accordance with the nareit white paper on funds from
    operations we include the effects of straightline rents in funds from
    operations further we do not adjust funds from operations to eliminate the
    effects of nonrecurring charges

2 represents ffo attributable to minority interest in consolidated joint
    ventures for the period presented which has been computed as minority
    interests share of net income plus minority interests share of real
    estaterelated depreciation and amortization of the consolidated joint
    ventures for such period these minority interests are not convertible into
    shares of common stock

3 represents our pro rata share of ffo in unconsolidated joint ventures for
    the period presented which has been computed as our share of net income
    plus our share of real estaterelated depreciation and amortization of the
    unconsolidated joint ventures for such period

4 includes the dilutive effect of stock options

                                 business risks

     our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences
to us these risks include among others

general real estate risks

there are factors outside of our control that affect the performance and value
of our properties

     real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk the
yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of
income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties as
well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties if our
properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses
including debt service and capital expenditures then our ability to pay
dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected income from and the
value of our properties may be adversely affected by the general economic
climate local conditions such as oversupply of industrial space or a reduction
in demand for industrial space the attractiveness of our properties to
potential customers competition from other properties our ability to provide
adequate maintenance and insurance and an increase in operating costs in
addition revenues from properties and real estate values are also affected by
factors such as the cost of compliance with regulations the potential for
liability under applicable laws including changes in tax laws interest rate
levels and the availability of financing our income would be adversely
affected if a significant number of customers were unable to pay rent or if we
were unable to rent our industrial space on favorable terms certain significant
expenditures associated with an investment in real estate such as mortgage
payments real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decline
when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property

we may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire

     we are subject to the risks that leases may not be renewed space may not
be relet or the terms of renewal or reletting including the cost of required
renovations may be less favorable than current lease terms leases on a total
of 156 of our properties based on annualized base rent as of december 31
2000 will expire on or prior to december 31 2001 in addition numerous
properties compete with our properties in attracting customers to lease space
particularly with respect to retail centers the number of competitive
commercial properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect
on our ability to lease space in our properties and on the rents that we are
able to charge our financial condition results of operations cash flow and
our ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be
adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew the leases for
all or a substantial portion of expiring leases if the rental rates upon
renewal or reletting is significantly lower than expected or if our reserves
for these purposes prove inadequate

real estate investments are illiquid

     because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to
vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions is
limited the limitations in the internal revenue code and related regulations on
a real estate investment trust holding property for sale may affect our ability
to sell properties without adversely affecting dividends to our stockholders
the relative illiquidity of our holdings and internal revenue code prohibitions
and related regulations could impede our ability to respond to adverse changes
in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial
condition results of operations cash flow and our ability to pay dividends
on and the market price of our stock

a significant number of our properties are located in california

     our properties located in california as of december 31 2000 represented
approximately 242 of the aggregate square footage of our properties as of
december 31 2000 and 296 of our annualized base rent annualized base rent
means the monthly contractual amount under existing leases at december 31 2000
multiplied by 12 this amount excludes expense reimbursements and rental
abatements our revenue from and the value of our properties located in
california may be affected by a number of factors including local

                                        32
page   34

real estate conditions such as oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial
properties and the local economic climate business layoffs downsizing
industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors may adversely
impact the local economic climate a downturn in either the california economy
or in california real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial
condition results of operations cash flow and our ability to pay dividends
on and the market price of our stock certain of our properties are also
subject to possible loss from seismic activity

rising energy costs and power outages in california may have an adverse effect
on our operations and revenue

     problems associated with deregulation of the electricity industry in
california have resulted in intermittent service interruptions and significantly
higher costs in some areas properties located within municipalities that either
do not produce their own power or have not entered into longterm fixedprice
contracts may be subject to intermittent service interruptions or significant
rate increases from their utility providers most of our properties located in
california are subject to leases that require our tenants to pay all utility
costs the remainder of our california leases provide that tenants will
reimburse us for utility costs in excess of a base year amount although we have
not experienced any material losses resulting from electric deregulation it is
possible that some of our tenants will not fulfill their lease obligations and
reimburse us for their share of any significant rate increases and that we will
not be able to retain or replace our tenants if energy problems in california
continue

our properties are currently concentrated in the industrial sector

     our properties are currently concentrated predominantly in the industrial
real estate sector our concentration in a certain property type may expose us
to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our
portfolio also included other property types as a result of such concentration
economic downturns in the industrial real estate sector could have an adverse
effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability
to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock

some potential losses are not covered by insurance

     we carry comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss
insurance covering all of our properties with policy specifications and insured
limits that we believe are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances
given relative risk of loss the cost of such coverage and industry practice
there are however certain losses that are not generally insured because it is
not economically feasible to insure against them including losses due to riots
or acts of war certain losses such as losses due to floods or seismic activity
may be insured subject to certain limitations including large deductibles or
copayments and policy limits if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of
insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties then we
could lose the capital we invested in the properties as well as the anticipated
future revenue from the properties and in the case of debt which is with
recourse to us we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other
financial obligations related to the properties moreover as the general
partner of the operating partnership we will generally be liable for all of the
operating partnerships unsatisfied obligations other than nonrecourse
obligations any such liability could adversely affect our financial condition
results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the
market price of our stock

     a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be
subject to earthquake activity including california where as of december 31
2000 247 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 186 million rentable
square feet representing 242 of our properties based on aggregate square
footage and 296 based on annualized base rent are located we carry
replacement cost earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas
historically subject to seismic activity subject to coverage limitations and
deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable this insurance coverage
also applies to the properties managed by amb investment management with a
single aggregate policy limit and deductible applicable to those properties and
our properties the operating partnership owns 100 of the nonvoting preferred
stock of amb investment management through an annual analysis prepared by
outside consultants we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage in light of
current industry practice and determine the appropriate amount of

earthquake insurance to carry we may incur material losses in excess of
insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at
commercially reasonable rates

we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties owned
through joint ventures limited liability companies and partnerships

     as of december 31 2000 we had ownership interests in 30 joint ventures
limited liability companies or partnerships with third parties as well as
interests in three unconsolidated entities as of december 31 2000 we owned
approximately 155 million square feet excluding the three unconsolidated joint
ventures of our properties through these entities we may make additional
investments through these ventures in the future and presently plan to do so
with clients of amb investment management inc and certain development alliance
partners who share certain approval rights over major decisions partnership
limited liability company or joint venture investments may involve risks such
as the following

      our partners comembers or joint venturers might become bankrupt in
       which event we and any other remaining general partners members or
       joint venturers would generally remain liable for the liabilities of the
       partnership limited liability company or joint venture

      our partners comembers or joint venturers might at any time have
       economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with
       our business interests or goals

      our partners comembers or joint venturers may be in a position to take
       action contrary to our instructions requests policies or objectives
       including our current policy with respect to maintaining our
       qualification as a real estate investment trust and

      agreements governing joint ventures limited liability companies and
       partnerships often contain restrictions on the transfer of a joint
       venturers members or partners interest or buysell or other
       provisions which may result in a purchase or sale of the interest at a
       disadvantageous time or on disadvantageous terms

     we will however generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our
partnerships limited liability companies and joint ventures to permit us to
achieve our business objectives our organizational documents do not limit the
amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships limited liability
companies or joint ventures the occurrence of one or more of the events
described above could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results
of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price
of our stock

we may be unable to consummate acquisitions on advantageous terms

     we intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties
acquisitions of properties entail risks that investments will fail to perform in
accordance with expectations estimates of the costs of improvements necessary
for us to bring an acquired property up to market standards may prove
inaccurate in addition there are general investment risks associated with any
new real estate investment further we anticipate significant competition for
attractive investment opportunities from other major real estate investors with
significant capital including both publicly traded real estate investment trusts
and private institutional investment funds we expect that future acquisitions
will be financed through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit
facility proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating
partnership including issuances of limited partnership units by the operating
partnership or its subsidiaries and proceeds from property divestitures which
could have an adverse effect on our cash flow we may not be able to acquire
additional properties our inability to finance any future acquisitions on
favorable terms or the failure of acquisitions to conform with our expectations
or investment criteria or our failure to timely reinvest the proceeds from
property divestitures could adversely affect our financial condition results of
operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of
our stock

                                        34

we may be unable to complete renovation and development on advantageous terms

     the real estate development business including the renovation and
rehabilitation of existing properties involves significant risks these risks
include the following

      we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development
       projects and we may not complete construction on schedule or within
       budget resulting in increased debt service expense and construction
       costs and delays in leasing such properties and generating cash flow

      we may not be able to obtain or we may experience delays in obtaining
       all necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required
       governmental permits and authorizations

      new or renovated properties may perform below anticipated levels
       producing cash flow below budgeted amounts

      substantial renovation as well as new development activities regardless
       of whether or not they are ultimately successful typically require a
       substantial portion of managements time and attention that could divert
       managements time from our daytoday operations and

      activities that we finance through construction loans involve the risk
       that upon completion of construction we may not be able to obtain
       permanent financing or we may not be able to obtain permanent financing
       on advantageous terms

     these risks could have an adverse effect on our financial condition
results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the
market price of our stock

we may be unable to complete divestitures on advantageous terms

     we intend to dispose of properties from time to time that do not conform
with our current investment strategy or that we have otherwise determined should
be divested including as of december 31 2000 33 industrial buildings and one
retail center which are held for divestiture our ability to dispose of
properties on advantageous terms is dependent upon factors beyond our control
including competition from other owners including other real estate investment
trusts that are attempting to dispose of industrial and retail properties and
the availability of financing on attractive terms for potential buyers of our
properties our inability to dispose of properties on favorable terms or our
inability to redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with
our investment strategy could adversely our financial condition results of
operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of
our stock

debt financing

we could incur more debt

     we operate with a policy of incurring debt either directly or through our
subsidiaries only if upon such incurrence our debttototal market
capitalization ratio would be approximately 45 or less the aggregate amount of
indebtedness that we may incur under our policy varies directly with the
valuation of our capital stock and the number of shares of capital stock
outstanding accordingly we would be able to incur additional indebtedness
under our policy as a result of increases in the market price per share of our
common stock or other outstanding classes of capital stock and future issuance
of shares of our capital stock in spite of this policy our organizational
documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we
may incur accordingly our board of directors could alter or eliminate this
policy if we change this policy then we could become more highly leveraged
resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect our
financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay
dividends on and the market price of our stock

                                        35
page   37

scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition

     we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing including
the risks that cash flow will be insufficient to pay dividends to our
stockholders that we will be unable to refinance existing indebtedness on our
properties which in all cases will not have been fully amortized at maturity
and that the terms of refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of
existing indebtedness

     as of december 31 2000 we had total debt outstanding of approximately
18 billion including

      9304 million of secured indebtedness excluding unamortized debt
       premiums with an average maturity of 54 years and a weighted average
       interest rate of 79

      2160 million outstanding under our unsecured 5000 million credit
       facility with a maturity date of may 2003 and an interest rate of libor
       plus 75 basis points a weighted average interest rate of 75 as of
       december 31 2000 and

      6800 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior debt
       securities with maturities between 2005 and 2018 and a weighted average
       interest rate of 73

     we guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the
senior debt securities referenced above if we are unable to refinance or extend
principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital
transactions then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all
years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt
furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of
refinancing such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate
loans result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest
expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase this increased
interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition results of
operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of
our stock in addition if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure
payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments then the
property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a
consequent loss of income and asset value a foreclosure on one or more of our
properties could adversely affect our financial condition results of
operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of
our stock

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow

     as of december 31 2000 we had approximately 2160 million outstanding
under our unsecured credit facility in addition we may incur other variable
rate indebtedness in the future increases in interest rates on this
indebtedness could increase our interest expense which would adversely affect
our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay
dividends on and the market price of our stock accordingly we may in the
future engage in transactions to limit our exposure to rising interest rates

we are dependent on external sources of capital

     in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the internal
revenue code we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at
least 95 90 for years beginning on or after january 1 2001 of our real
estate investment trust taxable income determined without regard to the
dividendspaid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain and we are
subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed because of
this distribution requirement we may not be able to fund all future capital
needs including capital needs in connection with acquisitions from cash
retained from operations as a result to fund capital needs we rely on third
party sources of capital which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms
or at all our access to third party sources of capital depends upon a number of
factors including 1 general market conditions 2 the markets perception of
our growth potential 3 our current and potential future earnings and cash
distributions and 4 the market price of our capital stock additional debt
financing may substantially increase our leverage

                                        36
page   38

we could default on crosscollateralized and crossdefaulted debt

     as of december 31 2000 we had 18 nonrecourse secured loans which are
crosscollateralized by 20 properties as of december 31 2000 we had
approximately 2409 million not including unamortized debt premium
outstanding on these loans if we default on any of these loans then we will be
required to repay the aggregate of all indebtedness together with applicable
prepayment charges to avoid foreclosure on all the crosscollateralized
properties within the applicable pool foreclosure on our properties or our
inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms could adversely impact our
financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay
dividends on and the market price of our stock in addition our credit
facility and the senior debt securities of the operating partnership contain
certain crossdefault provisions which are triggered in the event that our
other material indebtedness is in default these crossdefault provisions may
require us to repay or restructure the credit facility and the senior debt
securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default which
could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash
flow and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock

contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition

     our predecessors have been in existence for varying lengths of time up to
18 years at the time of our formation we acquired the assets of these entities
subject to all of their potential existing liabilities there may be current
liabilities or future liabilities arising from prior activities that we are not
aware of and therefore have not disclosed in this report we assumed these
liabilities as the surviving entity in the various merger and contribution
transactions that occurred at the time of our formation existing liabilities
for indebtedness generally were taken into account in connection with the
allocation of the operating partnerships limited partnership units or shares of
our common stock in the formation transactions but no other liabilities were
taken into account for these purposes we do not have recourse against our
predecessors or any of their respective stockholders or partners or against any
individual account investors with respect to any unknown liabilities unknown
liabilities might include the following

      liabilities for cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental
       conditions

      claims of customers vendors or other persons dealing with our
       predecessors prior to the formation transactions that had not been
       asserted prior to the formation transactions

      accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
       business

      tax liabilities and

      claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our
       predecessors and others indemnified by these entities

     certain customers may claim that the formation transactions gave rise to a
right to purchase the premises that they occupy we do not believe any such
claims would be material and to date no such claims have been filed see
 government regulations  we could encounter costly environmental problems
below regarding the possibility of undisclosed environmental conditions
potentially affecting the value of our properties undisclosed material
liabilities in connection with the acquisition of properties entities and
interests in properties or entities could adversely affect our financial
condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on
and the market price of our stock

conflicts of interest

some of our executive officers are involved in other real estate activities and
investments

     some of our executive officers own interests in real estaterelated
businesses and investments these interests include minority ownership of
institutional housing partners lp a residential housing finance company and
ownership of amb development inc and amb development lp developers that
own property not suitable for ownership by us amb development inc and amb
development lp have agreed not to initiate any new development projects
following our initial public offering in november 1997 these entities have also
agreed that they will not make any further investments in industrial properties
other than
                                        37
page   39

those currently under development at the time of our initial public offering
amb development inc and amb development lp continue to use the name amb
pursuant to royaltyfree license arrangements the continued involvement in
other real estaterelated activities by some of our executive officers and
directors could divert managements attention from our daytoday operations
most of our executive officers have entered into noncompetition agreements with
us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities directly
or indirectly in respect of commercial real estate and not to make any
investment in respect of industrial real estate other than through ownership of
not more than 5 of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such
activities or through the existing investments referred to in this report state
law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements

     we could also in the future subject to the unanimous approval of the
disinterested members of the board of directors with respect to such
transaction acquire property from executive officers enter into leases with
executive officers or engage in other related activities in which the interests
pursued by the executive officers may not be in the best interests of our
stockholders

certain of our executive officers and directors may have conflicts of interest
with us in connection with other properties that they own or control

     as of december 31 2000 amb development lp owns interests in 10 retail
development projects in the us eight of which are single freestanding
walgreens drugstores and two are walgreens drugstores plus shop buildings which
are less than 10000 feet in addition messrs abbey moghadam and burke each
a founder and director own less than 1 interests in two partnerships that own
office buildings in various markets these interests have negligible value luis
a belmonte an executive officer owns less than a 10 interest representing
an estimated value of 150000 in a limited partnership which owns an office
building located in oakland california

     in addition several of our executive officers individually own

      less than 1 interests in the stocks of certain publiclytraded real
       estate investment trusts

      certain interests in and rights to developed and undeveloped real
       property located outside the united states and

      certain other de minimus holdings in equity securities of real estate
       companies

     thomas w tusher a member of our board of directors is a limited partner
in a partnership in which messrs abbey moghadam and burke are general
partners and which owns a 75 interest in an office building mr tusher owns a
20 interest in the partnership valued at approximately 12 million messrs
abbey moghadam and burke each have a 267 interest in the partnership each
valued at approximately 16 million

     we believe that the properties and activities set forth above generally do
not directly compete with any of our properties however it is possible that a
property in which an executive officer or director or an affiliate of an
executive officer or director has an interest may compete with us in the future
if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to
that property in addition the continued involvement by our executive officers
and directors in these properties could divert managements attention from our
daytoday operations our policy prohibits us from acquiring any properties
from our executive officers or their affiliates without the approval of the
disinterested members of our board of directors with respect to that
transaction

our role as general partner of the operating partnership may conflict with the
interests of stockholders

     as the general partner of the operating partnership we have fiduciary
obligations to the operating partnerships limited partners the discharge of
which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders in addition those
persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class
on certain amendments to the partnership agreement of the operating partnership
and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their
rights the limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that
conflicts with the interests of our stockholders in addition under the terms
of the operating

                                        38
page   40

partnerships partnership agreement holders of limited partnership units will
have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect
all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the
interests of all stockholders

our directors executive officers and significant stockholders could act in a
manner that is not in the best interest of all stockholders

     as of march 20 2001 our three largest stockholders cohen  steers
capital management inc with respect to various client accounts for which
cohen  steers capital management inc serves as investment advisor european
investors inc with respect to various client accounts for which european
investors inc serves as investment advisor and capital research and
management company with respect to various client accounts for which capital
research and management company serves as investment advisor beneficially owned
approximately 183 of our outstanding common stock in addition our executive
officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 51 of our outstanding
common stock as of march 20 2001 and will have influence on our management and
operation and as stockholders will have influence on the outcome of any
matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders this influence might be
exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other
stockholders although there is no understanding or arrangement for these
directors officers and stockholders and their affiliates to act in concert
these parties would be in a position to exercise significant influence over our
affairs if they choose to do so

we could invest in real estate mortgages

     we may invest in mortgages and may do so as a strategy for ultimately
acquiring the underlying property in general investments in mortgages include
the risks that borrowers may not be able to make debt service payments or pay
principal when due that the value of the mortgaged property may be less than
the principal amount of the mortgage note secured by the property and that
interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than our cost of funds to
acquire these mortgages in any of these events our funds from operations and
our ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be
adversely affected

government regulations

     many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and
changes in these laws and regulations or their interpretation by agencies and
the courts occur frequently

costs of compliance with americans with disabilities act

     under the americans with disabilities act places of public accommodation
must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled
persons compliance with the americans with disabilities act might require us to
remove structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas where
such removal is readily achievable if we fail to comply with the americans
with disabilities act then we might be required to pay fines to the government
or damages to private litigants the impact of application of the americans with
disabilities act to our properties including the extent and timing of required
renovations is uncertain if we are required to make unanticipated expenditures
to comply with the americans with disabilities act then our cash flow and the
amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected

we could encounter environmental problems

     federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection
of the environment impose liability on a current or previous owner or operator
of real estate for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of
hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at the property a current
or previous owner may be required to investigate and clean up contamination at
or migrating from a site these laws typically impose liability and cleanup
responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused
the presence of the contaminants even if more than one person may have been
responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws
may be held responsible for all of the cleanup

                                        39
page   41

costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a
site for damages based on personal injury property damage or other costs
including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from environmental
contamination present at or emanating from that site

     environmental laws also govern the presence maintenance and removal of
asbestos these laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing
asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos that they adequately inform
or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake
special precautions including removal or other abatement in the event that
asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building these laws
may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to
comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from
owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos
fibers some of our properties may contain asbestoscontaining building
materials

     some of our properties are leased or have been leased in part to owners
and operators of businesses that use store or otherwise handle petroleum
products or other hazardous or toxic substances these operations create a
potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic
substances some of our properties are adjacent to or near other properties that
have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or
toxic substances in addition certain of our properties are on are adjacent
to or are near other properties upon which others including former owners or
tenants of the properties have engaged or may in the future engage in
activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic
substances from time to time we may acquire properties or interests in
properties with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that
the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable
and the acquisition will yield a superior riskadjusted return environmental
issues for each property are evaluated and quantified prior to acquisition the
costs of environmental investigation cleanup and monitoring are underwritten
into the cost of the acquisition and appropriate environmental insurance is
obtained for the property in connection with certain divested properties we
have agreed to remain responsible for and to bear the cost of remediating or
monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties

     all of our properties were subject to a phase i or similar environmental
assessments by independent environmental consultants at the time of acquisition
phase i assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding
the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties
and include an historical review a public records review an investigation of
the surveyed site and surrounding properties and preparation and issuance of a
written report we may perform additional phase ii testing if recommended by the
independent environmental consultant phase ii testing may include the
collection and laboratory analysis of soil and groundwater samples completion
of surveys for asbestoscontaining building materials and any other testing
that the consultant considers prudent in order to test for the presence of
hazardous materials

     none of the environmental assessments of our properties has revealed any
environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole furthermore
we are not aware of any such material environmental liability nonetheless it
is possible that the assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities and
that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware or
that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are
materially greater than anticipated moreover the current environmental
condition of our properties may be affected by tenants the condition of land
operations in the vicinity of the properties such as releases from underground
storage tanks or by third parties unrelated to us if the costs of compliance
with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets
for these items then our financial condition results of operations cash flow
and ability to pay dividends on and the market price of our stock could be
adversely affected

our financial condition could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with
other regulations

     our properties are also subject to various federal state and local
regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety
requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements then we might incur
fines by governmental authorities or be required to pay awards of damages to
private litigants we believe that

                                        40
page   42

our properties are currently in substantial compliance with all such regulatory
requirements however these requirements may change or new requirements may be
imposed which could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us any
such unanticipated expenditures could have an adverse effect on our financial
condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on
and the market price of our stock

federal income tax risks

our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have serious
adverse consequences to stockholders

     we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under sections 856
through 860 of the internal revenue code commencing with our taxable year ended
december 31 1997 we currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real
estate investment trust under the internal revenue code and believe that our
current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and
regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to continue
to qualify as a real estate investment trust however it is possible that we
have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to
qualify as a real estate investment trust or that our future operations could
cause us to fail to qualify qualification as a real estate investment trust
requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly
basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code
provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative
interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and
circumstances not entirely within our control for example in order to qualify
as a real estate investment trust we must derive at least 95 of our gross
income in any year from qualifying sources in addition we must pay dividends
to stockholders aggregating annually at least 95 90 for years beginning on or
after january 1 2001 of our real estate investment trust taxable income
determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding
capital gains and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis
these provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in
our case because we hold our assets in partnership form legislation new
regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could
significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate
investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification
however we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely
affect our ability to operate as a real estate investment trust

     if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable
year then we will be required to pay federal income tax including any
applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate
rates unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions we
would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the
four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification if we
lose our real estate investment trust status then our net earnings available
for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced
for each of the years involved in addition we would no longer be required to
make distributions to our stockholders

we may invest in highly speculative earlystage companies that may jeopardize
our status as a real estate investment trust

     we believe that our investments in highly speculative earlystage companies
have been structured so that we currently qualify as a real estate investment
trust under the internal revenue code however if the value of these
investments either individually or in the aggregate appreciates significantly
then these investments may adversely affect our ability to continue to qualify
as a real estate investment trust unless we are able to restructure or dispose
of our holdings on a timely basis as of december 31 2000 we had invested
approximately 160 million in earlystage companies see  our failure to
qualify as a real estate investment trust would have serious adverse
consequences to stockholders and  we may invest in highly speculative
earlystage companies in which we may lose our entire investment

we pay some taxes

     even if we qualify as a real estate investment trust we will be required
to pay certain state and local taxes on our income and property in addition we
will be required to pay federal and state income tax on the net

                                        41
page   43

taxable income if any from the activities conducted through amb investment
management and headlands realty corporation which we discuss below under
 amb investment management and headlands realty corporation

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income

     from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our
properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers
of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in
the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited
transaction we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on that income
since we acquire properties for investment purposes we believe that any
transfer or disposal of property by us would not be deemed by the internal
revenue service to be a prohibited transaction with any resulting gain allocable
to us being subject to a 100 penalty tax however whether property is held for
investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and
circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the irs may contend that
certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions
while we believe that the irs would not prevail in any such dispute if the irs
successfully argued that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a
prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on
any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction in addition any
income from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect our ability to satisfy
the income tests for qualifications as a real estate investment trust for
federal income tax purposes

we are dependent on our key personnel

     we depend on the efforts of our executive officers while we believe that
we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel the loss of their
services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our
financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay
dividends on and the market price of our stock we do not have employment
agreements with any of our executive officers

we may be unable to manage our growth

     our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through property
acquisitions and developments if we fail to effectively manage our growth then
our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay
dividends on and the market price of our stock could be adversely affected

we may invest in highly speculative earlystage companies in which we may lose
our entire investment

     from time to time we may invest in highly speculative earlystage
companies that we believe will enhance our understanding of changes occurring in
the movement of goods which may in turn sharpen our real estate investment
focus create real estate provider relationships with growth companies and
provide the potential for significant returns on invested capital we believe
that the amounts of our investments in earlystage companies are immaterial
both individually and in the aggregate however these investments are highly
speculative and it is possible that we may lose our entire investment in an
earlystage company

amb investment management inc and headlands realty corporation

we do not control the activities of amb investment management inc and
headlands realty corporation

     the operating partnership owns 100 of the nonvoting preferred stock of
amb investment management inc and headlands realty corporation representing
approximately 95 of the economic interest in each entity some of our current

allowing us to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we receive
substantially all of the economic benefit of the businesses carried on by amb
investment management and headlands realty corporation through the operating
partnerships right to receive dividends however we are not able to elect the
directors or officers of amb investment management inc and headlands realty
corporation and as a result we do not have the ability to influence their
operation or to require that their boards of directors declare and pay cash
dividends on the nonvoting stock of amb investment management inc and
headlands realty corporation held by the operating partnership the boards of
directors and management of amb investment management inc and headlands realty
corporation might implement business policies or decisions that would not have
been implemented by persons controlled by us and that may be adverse to the
interests of our stockholders or that may adversely impact our financial
condition results of operations cash flow and ability to pay dividends on
and the market price of our stock in addition amb investment management inc
and headlands realty corporation as taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to
tax on their income reducing their cash available for distribution to the
operating partnership

amb investment management inc may not be able to generate sufficient fees

     fees earned by amb investment management inc depend on various factors
affecting the ability to attract and retain investment management clients and
the overall returns achieved on managed assets these factors are beyond our
control amb investment management incs failure to attract investment
management clients or achieve sufficient overall returns on managed assets could
reduce its ability to pay dividends on the stock owned by the operating
partnership and could also limit coinvestment opportunities to the operating
partnership this would limit the operating partnerships ability to generate
rental revenues from such coinvestments and use the coinvestment program as a
source to finance property acquisitions and leverage acquisition opportunities

ownership of our stock

limitations in our charter and bylaws could prevent a change in control

     certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay defer or prevent a
change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our
common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing
market price for the common stock to maintain our qualification as a real
estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in
value of our outstanding stock may be owned actually or constructively by five
or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain
entities during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year
for which a real estate investment trust election is made furthermore after
the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is
made our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335
days of a 12month taxable year or a proportionate part of a short tax year
in addition if we or an owner of 10 or more of our stock actually or
constructively owns 10 or more of one of our tenants or a tenant of any
partnership in which we are a partner then the rent received by us either
directly or through any such partnership from that tenant will not be
qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income
tests of the internal revenue code to facilitate maintenance of our
qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes
we will prohibit the ownership actually or by virtue of the constructive
ownership provisions of the internal revenue code by any single person of more
than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the
issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and more than 98 by value
or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the issued and
outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock and we will also prohibit
the ownership actually or constructively of any shares of our other preferred
stock by any single person so that no such person taking into account all of
our stock so owned by such person may own in excess of 98 of our issued and
outstanding capital stock we refer to this limitation as the ownership limit
shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred
to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary any person
who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to
any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any
proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the
price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale a transfer of
shares in violation of the

                                        43
page   45

above limits may be void under certain circumstances the ownership limit may
have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control and
therefore could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium
over the thenprevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in
connection with such transaction

     our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common stock and
series a preferred stock and to issue series b preferred stock series c
preferred stock series d preferred stock series e preferred stock series f
preferred stock series g preferred stock series h preferred stock series i
preferred stock and one or more other series or classes of preferred stock and
to establish the preferences rights and other terms of any series or class of
preferred stock that we issue although our board of directors has no intention
to do so at the present time it could establish a series or class of preferred
stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control
that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the
best interests of our stockholders

     our charter and bylaws and maryland law also contain other provisions that
may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control that
might involve payment of a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in
the best interests of our stockholders those provisions include the following

      the provision in the charter that directors may be removed only for cause
       and only upon a twothirds vote of stockholders together with bylaw
       provisions authorizing the board of directors to fill vacant
       directorships

      the provision in the charter requiring a twothirds vote of stockholders
       for any amendment of the charter

      the requirement in the bylaws that the request of the holders of 50 or
       more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special
       meeting

      the requirement of maryland law that stockholders may only take action by
       written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled
       to vote on the matter in question and

      the requirement in the bylaws of advance notice by stockholders for the
       nomination of directors or proposal of business to be considered at a
       meeting of stockholders

     these provisions may impede various actions by stockholders without
approval of our board of directors which in turn may delay defer or prevent a
transaction involving a change of control

we could change our investment and financing policies without a vote of
stockholders

     subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a
real estate investment trust unless a change is approved by our board of
directors under certain circumstances our board of directors will determine
our investment and financing policies our growth strategy and our debt
capitalization distribution and operating policies although the board of
directors has no present intention to revise or amend these strategies and
policies the board of directors may do so at any time without a vote of
stockholders accordingly stockholders will have no control over changes in our
strategies and policies other than through the election of directors and any
such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely
affect our financial condition or results of operations including our ability
to pay dividends to our stockholders

if we issue additional securities then the investment of existing stockholders
will be diluted

     we have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt
securities in exchange for property or otherwise similarly we may cause the
operating partnership to issue additional limited partnership units in exchange
for property or otherwise existing stockholders will have no preemptive right
to acquire any additional securities issued by us or the operating partnership
and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an
existing stockholders investment

                                        44

the large number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the
market price of our common stock

     we cannot predict the effect if any that future sales of shares of our
common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for future sale
will have on its market price sales of a substantial number of shares of our
common stock in the public market or upon exchange of limited partnership units
in the operating partnership or the perception that such sales or exchanges
might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

     all shares of common stock issuable upon the redemption of limited
partnership units in the operating partnership will be deemed to be restricted
securities within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act and may not
be transferred unless registered under the securities act or an exemption from
registration is available including any exemption from registration provided
under rule 144 in general upon satisfaction of certain conditions rule 144
permits the holder to sell certain amounts of restricted securities one year
following the date of acquisition of the restricted securities from us and
after two years permits unlimited sales by persons unaffiliated with us
commencing generally on the first anniversary of the date of acquisition of
common limited partnership units or such other date agreed to by the operating
partnership and the holders of the units the operating partnership may redeem
common limited partnership units at the request of the holders for cash based
on the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of common stock at
the time of redemption or at our option exchange the common limited
partnership units for an equal number of shares of our common stock subject to
certain antidilution adjustments the operating partnership had issued and
outstanding 5827917 common limited partnership units as of december 31 2000
as of december 31 2000 we had reserved 8537368 shares of common stock for
issuance under our stock option and incentive plan not including shares that we
have already issued and as of december 31 2000 we had granted to certain
directors officers and employees options to purchase 5666830 shares of common
stock excluding forfeitures and 128216 shares that we have issued pursuant to
the exercise of options as of december 31 2000 we had granted 311017
restricted shares of common stock 1931 of which have been forfeited in
addition we may issue additional shares of common stock and the operating
partnership may issue additional limited partnership units in connection with
the acquisition of properties in connection with the issuance of common limited
partnership units to other transferors of properties and in connection with the
issuance of the performance units we have agreed to file registration
statements covering the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exchange of
the common limited partnership units we have also filed a registration
statement with respect to the shares of common stock issuable under our stock
option and incentive plan these registration statements and registration rights
generally allow shares of common stock covered thereby including shares of
common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units including
performance units or the exercise of options or restricted shares of common
stock to be transferred or resold without restriction under the securities act
we may also agree to provide registration rights to any other person who may
become an owner of the operating partnerships limited partnership units

     future sales of the shares of common stock described above could adversely
affect the market price of our common stock the existence of the operating
partnerships limited partnership units options and shares of common stock
reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the
exercise of options and registration rights referred to above also may
adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital
through the sale of equity securities

various market conditions affect the price of our stock

     as with other publiclytraded equity securities the market price of our
stock will depend upon various market conditions which may change from time to
time among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our stock
are the following

      the extent of investor interest in us

      the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the
       attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity
       securities including securities issued by other real estatebased
       companies
                                        45
page   47

      our financial performance and

      general stock and bond market conditions including changes in interest
       rates on fixed income securities that may lead prospective purchasers of
       our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends such an
       increase in the required yield from dividends may adversely affect the
       market price of our stock

     other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax
laws could also have a significant impact on the future market price of our
stock

earnings and cash dividends asset value and market interest rates affect the
price of our stock

     the market value of the equity securities of a real estate investment trust
generally is based primarily upon the markets perception of the real estate
investment trusts growth potential and its current and potential future
earnings and cash dividends it is based secondarily upon the real estate market
value of the underlying assets for that reason shares of our stock may trade
at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the
extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working
capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the
value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market
price of our stock our failure to meet the markets expectation with regard to
future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market
price of our stock another factor that may influence the price of our stock
will be the distribution yield on the stock as a percentage of the price of the
stock relative to market interest rates an increase in market interest rates
might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution
yield which would adversely affect the market price of the stock if the market
price of our stock declines significantly then we might breach certain
covenants with respect to debt obligations which might adversely affect our
liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay
dividends to our stockholders



item 7a qualitative disclosures about market risk

     our exposure to market risk includes 1 the rising interest rates in
connection with our unsecured credit facility and other variable rate
borrowings and 2 our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval
thereby increasing our debt service obligations which could adversely affect
our cash flows see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial

 2 summary of significant accounting policies

     generally accepted accounting principles these consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the united states using the accrual method of accounting the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates

     principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the financial position results of operations and cash flows
of the company its whollyowned qualified reit subsidiaries the operating
partnership and joint ventures the joint ventures in which the company has
a controlling interest thirdparty equity interests in the operating
partnership and the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the
consolidated financial statements the company also has three noncontrolling
limited partnership interests in three separate unconsolidated real estate joint
ventures which are accounted for under the equity method all significant
intercompany amounts have been eliminated

     investments in real estate investments in real estate are stated at cost
unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered in which case the
carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value net
realizable value for financial reporting purposes is reviewed for impairment on
a propertybyproperty basis whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable
impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows undiscounted
and without interest charges are less than the carrying amount of the property
the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and
relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market
conditions and the availability of capital if impairment analysis assumptions
change then an adjustment to the carrying amount of the companys longlived
assets could occur to the extent that a property is impaired the excess of the
carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to
income the management of the company believed that there was no impairment of
the carrying value of its investments in real estate at december 31 2000
